for the deadliest storm in cuba see  
the 1924 cuba hurricane is the earliest officially classified   on the  and one of two hurricanes to make landfall on  at category 5 intensity the other being  in 2017 it formed on october14 in the western caribbean slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward by october16 it attained hurricane status to the east of the  and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop on october18 the hurricane began undergoing  and the next day it reached an estimated peak intensity of 165mph  270km h  shortly thereafter it struck extreme western cuba at peak intensity becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country later the hurricane weakened greatly striking southwestern florida with winds of 90mph  150km h  in a sparsely populated region while crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status and after accelerating east-northeastward it was absorbed by a  on october23 south of bermuda across the western caribbean sea the developing storm produced heavy rainfall and increased winds strong winds in western cuba caused severe damage with two small towns nearly destroyed about 90people were killed in the country all in  later the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to southern florida which caused flooding and crop damage damage was light in the state and there were no casualties

map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the 


on october14 a  was first observed over the western caribbean sea just off the eastern honduras coast it was a large and weak tropical cyclone moving slowly northwestward and gradually intensifying on october15 it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status and its strengthening became more steady the next day the storm reached hurricane status about 130mi  215km  southeast of   around that time it began to execute a small counterclockwise loop off the east coast of the yucatn peninsula by october18 the hurricane completed the loop during which its winds increased to 115mph  185km h  this is the equivalence of a  or a category3 on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale the estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of  and  by ships and land stations beginning late on october18 as it tracked north-northeastward toward cuba the hurricane underwent  evidenced by a ship wind report of 120mph  193km h  this wind report was initially thought to be the peak intensity of the cyclone  however subsequent research confirmed further deepening based on very low pressures recorded across the region a ship in the  reported a reading of 922  the barometer on the ship was found to be 5mbar too high resulting in a pressure of 917mbar additionally a station on land reported a pressure of 932mbar  27.52inhg  based on the readings the  estimated the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 910mbar very near the western coast of cuba  this suggested peak winds of 165mph  270km h  late on october19 the hurricane made  in extreme western cuba in   director of the national observatory at havana believed that  this hurricane  one of the most severe ever experienced in our latitudes 
after exiting cuba into the gulf of mexico the hurricane weakened greatly on october20 it passed a short distance west of  and very early on october21 the hurricane moved over  with winds of 90mph  150km h  the cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over  it accelerated east-northeastward moving over the  in  gradually weakening the storm interacted with an approaching cold front  late on october23 it transitioned into an  and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front impact and records 
as a developing tropical cyclone the storm produced increased winds and lower pressures in the  off the coast of honduras heavy rainfall occurred throughout jamaica causing street flooding and several mudslides but little damage no disruptions were reported to communications or railway travel the storm brushed eastern belize while located off the coast producing 3.62inches  21.9mm  of rainfall and light winds in extreme western cuba damage was very severe from the strong winds likened to the impact of a tornado severe damage was reported in los arroyos and arroyos de mantua in the latter location around a dozen people were killed 50 were injured and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged  heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop across western  the hurricane destroyed all communication links further from the center the capital city of  recorded southerly winds of 72mph  116km h  as well as a minimum pressure of about 999mbar  29.50inhg  around the country the hurricane capsized several ships primarily fishing vessels the death toll in the country was estimated at around 90 in the days after the storm cuban  authorized about  30,000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in pinar del ro several days prior to striking florida the outer circulation began producing rainfall across the state  were issued along the east and west coastlines northward to  and  later hurricane warnings were issued for much of the same area and schools in the  area were closed as the storm was expected to move ashore the hurricane first affected florida when it passed west of  where sustained winds of 66mph  107km h  along with gusts to 74mph  120km h  were reported little damage occurred in the region limited to downed trees  this was due to advance warning by the  which advised ships to remain at port and for residents to secure property later the hurricane moved ashore in a sparsely populated region of southwestern florida damage was reported in fort myers and punta gorda and communications were temporarily cut although no deaths were reported heavy rainfall was reported along its path and one location accumulated 23.22inches  590mm  in a 24hour period  this established a new one-day rainfall record in the state a station in miami recorded 12.18inches  309mm  and wind gusts in the area approached hurricane force the combination of winds and rain damaged 5 of the local citrus and avocado crop the rainfall flooded streets homes and commercial buildings in the miami area and hundreds of people were left without telephone access no impact was reported in the bahamas after a reanalysis of hurricanes between 1921 and 1925 the  atlantic reanalysis project determined this hurricane attained winds of 165mph  270km h  making it a  on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale the hurricane is the earliest known to have attained the intensity besting the  which was previously thought to be the earliest storm of this intensity it is also one of only two on record to make  in cuba at category5 status with the other being  of  which was slightly weaker at landfall having maximum sustained winds of 160mph  260km h  a  that hit the country was also thought to have struck at category5 status although the storm existed prior to the start of the atlantic hurricane database when the steamship  toledo  recorded an atmospheric pressure of 922mbar  27.22inhg  in the storm it was the lowest pressure recorded in an atlantic hurricane breaking the previous record of 924   27.28 inhg  in the atlantic hurricane of 1853 the record during this storm lasted until the  when a pressure of 915mbar  27.02inhg  was reported the reading of 932 mbar  27.52 inhg  at los arroyos in   remains the lowest pressure recorded on land in cuba see also
