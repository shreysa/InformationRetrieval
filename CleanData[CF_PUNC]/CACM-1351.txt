automatic error bounds on real zeros of rational functions a procedure for implementing an interval arithmetic version of the newton-raphson method is proposed the procedure require only a starting interval over which the zeros of a given rational function are to be located the method automatically provides bounds for roundoff error cacm November, 1966 Dargel, R.
