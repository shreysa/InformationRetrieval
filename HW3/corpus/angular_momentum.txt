 of the  m with respect to the origin o can be resolved into components parallel to  v  and perpendicular to  v  the radius vector r the angular momentum of m is proportional to the  v of the velocity or equivalently to the perpendicular distance r from the origin 

angular momentum is a  quantity  more precisely a   that represents the product of a body s  and  about a particular axis in the simple case of revolution of a  in a  about a center of rotation the particle remaining always in the same  and having always the same distance from the center it is sufficient to discard the  nature of angular momentum and treat it as a  angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of  thus where linear momentum  is proportional to   and   


angular momentum  is proportional to   and   


unlike mass which depends only on amount of matter moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter unlike linear speed which occurs in a straight line angular speed occurs about a center of rotation therefore strictly speaking  should be referred to as the angular momentum relative to that center because  for a single particle and  for circular motion angular momentum can be expanded  and reduced to 


the product of the  of rotation  and the  of the particle  where  in this case is the equivalent  at the radius   this simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is  to the  is considered in that case 


where  is the perpendicular component of the motion expanding  rearranging  and reducing angular momentum can also be expressed 


where  is the length of the  a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle it is this definition  length of moment arm linear momentum  to which the term moment of momentum refers scalar  angular momentum from lagrangian mechanics 
another approach is to define angular momentum as the conjugate momentum of the angular coordinate  expressed in the  of the mechanical system consider a mechanical system with a mass  constrained to move in a circle of radius  in the absence of any external force field the kinetic energy of the system is



and the potential energy is



then the lagrangian is



the generalized momentum  canonically conjugate to  the coordinate  is defined by



vector  angular momentum in three dimensions 


relationship between   f       p  and angular momentum  l  vectors in a rotating system  r  is the radius 

to completely define angular momentum in  it is required to know the  the direction of the axis of rotation and the sense  right or left-handed  of the rotation as well as the  involved by retaining this  nature of angular momentum the general nature of the equations is also retained and can describe any sort of three-dimensional  about the center of rotation    or otherwise in  the angular momentum of a  in motion about the  is defined as 

 where




 is the  for a  





 is the  of the particle about the origin 





 is the  of the particle relative to the origin  





 is the  of the particle relative to the origin 





and  is the  of the particle 


this can be expanded  reduced  and by the rules of  rearranged to the form 


which is the  of the position vector  and the linear momentum  of the particle by the definition of the cross product the  vector is  to both  and  it is directed along the axis of rotation as indicated by the   so that the rotation is seen as  from the head of the vector conversely the  vector defines the  in which  and  lie by defining a   in the direction of the axis of rotation a   results where

 and
 where  is the perpendicular component of the motion as above 
the two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction 



and  for circular motion where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius  discussion 
angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of  like linear momentum it involves elements of  and  unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of  and  many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space be it in actual rotation about it or simply moving past it where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point  can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it   the ability to do  can be stored in matter by setting it in motion  a combination of its  and its displacement inertia is measured by its  and displacement by its  their product 


is the matter s  referring this momentum to a central point introduces a complication  the momentum is not applied to the point directly for instance a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is in effect at the end of a  of the same length as the wheel s radius its momentum turning the lever about the center point this imaginary lever is known as the moment arm it has the effect of multiplying the momentum s effort in proportion to its length an effect known as a  hence the particle s momentum referred to a particular point 


is the angular momentum sometimes called as here the moment of momentum of the particle versus that particular center point the equation  combines a moment  a mass  turning moment arm   with a linear  straight-line equivalent  speed  linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance  and the angular speed  versus the point   another moment hence angular momentum contains a double moment   simplifying slightly  the quantity  is the particle s  sometimes called the second moment of mass it is a measure of rotational inertia 



  shown here  and therefore angular momentum is different for every possible configuration of  and  

because rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum it necessarily includes all of the complications of  which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the  of their  from the center of rotation therefore the total moment of inertia and the angular momentum is a complex function of the configuration of the  about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bits for a  for instance a wheel or an asteroid the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the  versus the matter of the body it may or may not pass through the  or it may lie completely outside of the body for the same body angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place it reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of mass for a collection of objects revolving about a center for instance all of the bodies of the  the orientations may be somewhat organized as is the solar system with most of the bodies  axes lying close to the system s axis their orientations may also be completely random in brief the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation  the longer the   the greater the moment of inertia and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given  in many cases the  and hence the angular momentum can be simplified by 

where  is the  the distance from the axis at which the entire mass  may be considered as concentrated 
similarly for a   the  is defined as 

where  is the  of the point mass from the center of rotation 
and for any collection of particles  as the sum 


angular momentum s dependence on position and shape is reflected in its  versus linear momentum    or  for angular momentum versus  or  for linear momentum angular momentum s units can be interpreted as seconds seconds or seconds an object with angular momentum of l nms can be reduced to zero rotation  all of the energy can be transferred out of it  by an angular  of l nms or equivalently by torque or work of l nm for one second or energy of l j for one second the   to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the center of mass is sometimes called the invariable plane because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system free from outside influences are considered one such plane is the  angular momentum and torque

 can be expressed mathematically 


or       the rotational equivalent is



or       because angular acceleration is the time  of  this is equivalent to  rearranging into a form suitable for   and  and integrating with respect to time 


therefore a torque acting over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum known as angular impulse by analogy with  which is defined as the change in  the constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum of the body before the torque began to act in particular if torque  then angular momentum  that is if no torque acts upon a body then its angular momentum remains constant conversely 


or angular momentum      and its time  is



because moment of inertia is constant  is zero and  which as above reduces to



therefore the time rate of change of angular momentum about a particular center of rotation is equivalent to applied  about that center if angular momentum is constant  and no torque is applied conservation of angular momentum 




a  conserves angular momentum  her  increases as her  decreases by drawing in her arms and legs 

a rotational analog of  might be written  in a  no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque  hence angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant  is conserved  similarly a rotational analog of  might be  a change in angular momentum is proportional to the applied torque and occurs about the same axis as that torque  since a torque applied over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum then if torque is zero angular momentum is constant as above a system with constant angular momentum is a closed system therefore requiring the system to be closed is equivalent to requiring that no external influence in the form of a torque acts upon it a rotational analog of  might be written  a body continues in a state of rest or of uniform rotation unless acted by an external torque  thus with no external influence to act upon it the original angular momentum of the system is conserved the conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing  if the net force on some body is directed always toward some point the center then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center as all of the force is directed along the  and none is  to the radius mathematically torque  because in this case  and  are parallel vectors therefore the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant this is the case with  in the  of  and  where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary central force motion is also used in the analysis of the  of the  for a planet angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms the conservation of angular momentum in the  results in the transfer of angular momentum from earth to moon due to  the moon exerts on the earth this in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of earth at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day and in gradual increase of the radius of moon s orbit at about 3.82centimeters per year 



the  caused by the two opposing forces fg and fg causes a change in the angular momentum l in the direction of that torque  since torque is the time derivative of angular momentum  this causes the  to  

the conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an  as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation by bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body s moment of inertia because angular momentum is the product of  and  if the angular momentum remains constant  is conserved  then the angular velocity  rotational speed  of the skater must increase the same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars  like   and   when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars decrease in the size of an object n times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of n2 conservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint for example a spinning  is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the  axis but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis and another about its  axis also in any  the planets star s  comets and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved  states that every  is associated with a   invariant  of the underlying physics the symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is  the fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved angular momentum in orbital mechanics

in astrodynamics and  a massless  or per unit mass  angular momentum is defined



called  note that   is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations because motion is defined by  the primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it  it is in effect stationary all bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way regardless of mass and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditions solid bodies 
for a continuous mass distribution with  function  r  a differential  dv with  r within the mass has a mass element dm    r dv therefore the  angular momentum of this element is 



and  this  over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentum 



in the derivation which follows integrals similar to this can replace the sums for the case of continuous mass collection of particles




the angular momentum of the particles i is the sum of the cross products r  mv   ri  mivi 

for a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin it is informative to develop the equation of angular momentum by resolving their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin given 
 is the mass of particle   is the position vector of particle  vs the origin  is the velocity of particle  vs the origin  is the position vector of the center of mass vs the origin  is the velocity of the center of mass vs the origin  is the position vector of particle  vs the center of mass  is the velocity of particle  vs the center of mass 
the total mass of the particles is simply their sum 


the position vector of the center of mass is defined by 


by inspection 
 and 

the total angular momentum of the collection of particles is the sum of the angular momentum of each particle

it can be shown that  see sidebar  

 and 

therefore the second and third terms vanish 


the first term can be rearranged 


and total angular momentum for the collection of particles is finally 




the first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to the origin similar to  below it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass m at the center of mass moving with velocity v the second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass similar to  below the result is general  the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass the particles need not be individual masses but can be elements of a continuous distribution such as a solid body rearranging equation   by vector identities multiplying both terms by  one  and grouping appropriately 


gives the total angular momentum of the system of particles in terms of   and

angular momentum  modern definition 




the 3-angular momentum as a   plane element  and  of a particle of mass m with instantaneous 3-position x and 3-momentum p 

in modern  20th century  theoretical physics angular momentum  not including any intrinsic angular momentum  see   is described using a different formalism instead of a classical  in this formalism angular momentum is the   associated with rotational invariance as a result angular momentum is not conserved for general  unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant 
in classical mechanics the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element 



in which the   replaces the    these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent  this has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element defined from the x and p vectors and the expression is true in any number of dimensions  two or higher  in cartesian coordinates 



or more compactly in index notation 



the angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor with components ij the relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor 



again this equation in l and  as tensors is true in any number of dimensions this equation also appears in the  formalism in which l and  are bivectors and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them in  the  of a particle is expressed as an  of second order 



in the language of  namely the  x and the  p and absorbs the above l together with the motion of the  of the particle in each of the above cases for a system of particles the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta and the centre of mass is for the system angular momentum in quantum mechanics

angular momenta of a classical object 
left   spin  angular momentum s is really orbital angular momentum of the object at every point 
right  extrinsic orbital angular momentum l about an axis 
top  the  i and    l is not always parallel to   
bottom  momentum p and its radial position r from the axis.the total angular momentum  spin plus orbital  is j for a quantum particle the interpretations are different   does not have the above interpretation 

the classical definition of angular momentum as  can be carried over to quantum mechanics by reinterpreting r as the quantum  and p as the quantum  l is then an  specifically called the  the components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the lie algebra so 3  of the rotation group so 3  indeed these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum hilbert space  see also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations 
however in quantum physics there is another type of angular momentum called  represented by the spin operator s almost all  have spin spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture  spin is an intrinsic property of a particle unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum all  have a characteristic spin for example  have  spin 1 2   this actually means  spin  2  while  have  spin 1   this actually means  spin   finally there is  j which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields  for one particle j   l   s   applies to j but not to l or s  for example the  allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between l and s with the total remaining constant electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum but can also have fractional values quantization 
in  angular momentum is   that is it cannot vary continuously but only in   between certain allowed values for any system the following restrictions on measurement results apply where  is the  and  is any  such as x y or z 





in this  on a circular string the circle is broken into exactly 8  a standing wave like this can have 0,1,2 or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle but it cannot have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3 in quantum mechanics angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason 

 there are additional restrictions as well see  for details 
the   is tiny by everyday standards about 1034  and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects however it is very important in the microscopic world for example the structure of  and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by  in his  of the atom and was later predicted by  in his  uncertainty 
in the definition  six operators are involved  the     and the     however the  tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision therefore there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle s angular momentum it turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector s  and its component along one axis the uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an  do not  for example   for the precise  see  
total angular momentum as generator of rotations 
as mentioned above orbital angular momentum l is defined as in classical mechanics   but total angular momentum j is defined in a different more basic way  j is defined as the  generator of rotations  more specifically j is defined so that the operator



is the  that takes any system and rotates it by angle  about the axis   the  exp  in the formula refers to   to put this the other way around whatever our quantum hilbert space is we expect that the  will act on it there is then an associated action of the lie algebra so 3  of so 3  the operators describing the action of so 3  on our hilbert space are the  total  angular momentum operators the relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between  and  in mathematics the close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in  that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant angular momentum in electrodynamics

newton s derivation 


newton s derivation of the area law using geometric means 

as a  orbits the  the line between the sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time this had been known since  expounded his  newton derived a unique geometric proof and went on to show that the attractive force of the sun s  was the cause of all of kepler s laws during the first interval of time an object is in motion from point a to point b undisturbed it would continue to point c during the second interval when the object arrives at b it receives an impulse directed toward point s the impulse gives it a small added velocity toward s such that if this were its only velocity it would move from b to v during the second interval by the  these two velocities add and point c is found by construction of parallelogram bccv thus the object s path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point c at the end of the second interval because the triangles sbc and sbc have the same base sb and the same height bc or vc they have the same area by symmetry triangle sbc also has the same area as triangle sab therefore the object has swept out equal areas sab and sbc in equal times at point c the object receives another impulse toward s again deflecting its path during the third interval from d to d thus it continues to e and beyond the triangles sab sbc sbc scd scd sde sde all having the same area allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller the path abcde approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve note that because this derivation is geometric and no specific force is applied it proves a more general law than kepler s second law of planetary motion it shows that the law of areas applies to any central force attractive or repulsive continuous or non-continuous or zero conservation of angular momentum in the law of areas 
the proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles that is the lines from s to the object are equivalent to the  and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of  hence if the area swept per unit time is constant then by the triangular area formula 1 2 base height  the product  base height  and therefore the product rv are constant  if r and the base length are decreased v and height must increase proportionally mass is constant therefore  is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity in the case of triangle sbc area is equal to 1 2 sb vc  wherever c is eventually located due to the impulse applied at b the product  sb vc  and therefore rmv remain constant similarly so for each of the triangles after newton 
  and  all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of  a result of their analysis of  of planetary motion it is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter in 1736 euler like newton touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his  without further developing them bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a  moment of rotational motion  possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it in 1799  first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation  his   in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation and elaborated on the  conservation of moments  in 1852  used a  in an experiment to display the earth s rotation  1858 manual of applied mechanics defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time 
a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point and such that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotation 
in an 1872 edition of the same book rankine stated that  the term angular momentum was introduced by mr hayward  probably referring to r.b hayward s article on a direct method of estimating velocities accelerations and all similar quantities with respect to axes moveable in any manner in space with applications which was introduced in 1856 and published in 1864 rankine was mistaken as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries however hayward s article apparently was the first use of the term and the concept seen by much of the english-speaking world before this angular momentum was typically referred to as  momentum of rotation  in english see also
