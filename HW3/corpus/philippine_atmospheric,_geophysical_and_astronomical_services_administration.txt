history
formal meteorological and astronomical services in the philippines began in 1865 with the establishment of the  in padre faura st  when francisco colina a young  scholastic and professor at the  started a systematic observation and recording of the weather two or three times a day jaime nonell another jesuit scholastic wrote a brief treatise on these observations which was printed by the  the treatise attracted the attention of businessmen in manila and a request was made to the jesuit director fr juan vidal sj for regular observations for the purpose of warning the public against approaching typhoons the businessmen financed the procurement and acquisition of an instrument called the universal meteorograph  an invention of another jesuit fr angelo seechi sj of the  in   which would greatly aid in the day and night observations of the weather in 1866 federico faura sj became the director of the observatorio in recognition of scientific abilities during this time the observatorio was engaged in the systematic observation of philippine weather on july 7 1879 after data comparison with another jesuit friar in the west indies the observatorio issued a warning indicating that a tropical cyclone was crossing northern luzon the colonial government took every possible precaution based on the reliability of the warning and the slight losses from the typhoon finally and permanently cemented the reputation of the observatorio this was followed by a prediction in november of the same year that a tropical cyclone will pass by manila the observatorio began conducting  and  observations in 1880 in 1885 the observatorio started time service and a system of visual   weather warnings for merchant shipping in 1886 the faura aneroid barometer was released in 1887 a section devoted to the study of terrestrial magnetism was set up and six years later the first maps of terrestrial magnetism in the philippines was published in 1890 the seismological service was officially established and in 1899 the astronomical section was opened this reputation reached foreign shores and other observatories began requesting for the monthly boletin del observatorio de manila the growing demands for the services of the led observatorio led to the issuance of a royal decree on april 21 1894 this effectively recognized the observatorio as an official institution under the jesuit order with full support from the spanish crown this led to the establishment of a network of secondary stations in various points of luzon american period  the weather bureau 
under the  on december 10 1898  ceded the philippine islands to the  after a period of great political turbulence that climaxed in the outbreak of  in 1899 an  was established on may 22 1901 the  enacted act no 131 reorganizing the observatorio meteorolgico de manila into the weather bureau under the  with the establishment of the  on january 1 1917 the weather bureau was transferred from the department of interior to danr with the establishment of the  the danr was reorganized into the department of agriculture and commerce for nearly 45 years the weather bureau remained active and famous in international expositions and scientific expeditions and continued to be well known for its accurate typhoon forecasts and scientific works in the field of meteorology geomagnetism and astronomy the first weather map in far east  released in 1908 by fr coronas  became an important tool in tropical cyclone forecasting thereon the bureau s published works on meteorology terrestrial magnetism and astronomy were well known and had later proven to be of great value to the american forces in the  during the  second world war 
on october 4 1943 with the establishment of the  as a puppet state of japan during its  the weather bureau was transferred to the department of public works and communications the bureau was removed from the direction of the jesuits and for the first time the bureau had an all-filipino staff headed by mr maximo lachica head of the department of geodetic engineering of the  the japanese occupation period marked limited activity in the central office however in the field bureau personnel were instrumental in bringing accurate weather information over enemy-occupied territory to the combined liberation forces of the american and filipino soldiers on february 1945 the  brought the operations of the weather bureau to a catastrophic halt when its offices were destroyed during the  nothing but the burnt-out shell of its astronomical dome in padre faura st bore testimony to its once glorious past all the instruments records mass of scientific knowledge accumulated through the decades were lost after the war the observatorio ceased to function as the weather bureau the former would later resume independent operations in 1951 as the  postwar era  1945-1972  rebirth 
the rebirth of the weather bureau began on july 24 1945 when it was reestablished by seven constituent personnel under the leadership of edilberto parulan as officer-in-charge in 1946 pursuant to the tydings war damage act  philippine rehabilitation act of 1946  a  mission was sent to manila by the united states government to undertake a survey of the needs of the weather bureau as a result the bureau was able to acquire meteorological equipment and technical assistance from the united states that paved the way for the establishment of standard weather services patterned after similar meteorological institutions in more technically-advanced countries furthermore the weather bureau was transferred to the department of commerce and industry the bureau s functions were then carried out by five divisions  synoptic climatological geophysical astronomical and administrative  in 1947 the central office of the weather bureau was moved to marsman building  opposite pier 15 at the port area of manila  while the forecasting center was transferred to the old balagbag terminal  site of the first terminal of the   and became the manila main meteorological office  mmmo  the first post-war geophysical observatory of the bureau was established in 1949 behind the campus of the  in diliman in 1948 a set of electromagnetic photorecording  was installed in order to improve its seismological services on april 5 1949 the philippines was admitted into the   wmo  with the weather bureau as its national meteorological service in the same year temperature relative humility and pressure observations in the upper atmosphere were made twice daily by the   and  field stations 
in 1950 a teletype service connected mmmo to   and the bureau of telecommunications  precursor to the current  moreover exchange of weather reports with foreign countries aircraft-in-flight and four aeronautical stations in the country  laoag legazpi cebu   zamboanga began at this year private radio systems and the then national civil defense administration also helped to facilitate the reception of data and dissemination of the forecasts and warnings in 1954 radio transmissions of time signals  which were done seven times daily  began in the geophysical observatory  which was now called astronomical observatory at this time  weather surveillance radar was first installed in the philippines in 1963 atop the central office of the bureau  but this was destroyed beyond repair by a fire in 1978in 1965 on its centenary half of the weather stations across the country were already linked with each other by  radio transceivers forming an independent meteorological communication system in 1968 the philippines joined the typhoon committee formed by the economic commission for asia and the far east  ecafe now economic and social commission for asia and the pacific or escap  and the wmo the following year saw the transfer of the central office from the marsman building to 1424  in  the same year also ushered the 5-year  wmo training and research project manila  composed of the institute of meteorology in the weather bureau and the department of meteorology in the university of the philippines the project aimed to meet the training needs of the country s meteorological personnel and to carry out research in various fields of meteorology the institute provided technical in-service training in various levels while the department offered a post-graduate course leading to a master of science degree in meteorology with the implementation of the project the acquisition of an  was realized and computerization in the bureau came of age a telemetry system in the  was then set up which led to the bureau s initial efforts in flood forecasting  came to the philippines in 1970 when an  system was set-up to intercept phototransmission of the upper atmosphere by weather satellites the first post-war major research initiative of the bureau was launched in the same year called the  typhoon research project it was launched in 1970 was made possible through the financial assistance of the  in 1971 upon invitation of the philippines the ecafe wmo joint unit was reallocated in manila and was rechristened as the typhoon committee secretariat in the same year the linking of five weather surveillance radars installed across different parts of the country and the manila radar station  it was not yet destroyed until 1978  paved the way for the weather radar surveillance network of the bureau marcos era  from weather bureau to pagasa 
in 1972 at the height of  of president  the weather bureau was abolished and a new agency the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration  pagasa  was established pursuant to the atmospheric geophysical and astronomical science act of 1972  presidential decree no 78 s 1972  as part of the integrated reorganization plan  presidential decree no 1 s 1972  of the philippine government this new agency was placed under the authority of the   dnd  four organization units initially comprised pagasa the national weather service undertakes the preparation and subsequent prompt issuance of forecasts and warnings of weather and flood conditions the national atmospheric geophysical and astronomical data service undertakes the acquisition collection quality control processing and archiving of atmospheric and allied data the national geophysical and astronomical service undertakes observations and studies of seismological and astronomical phenomena as well as provides the official time for the country the national institute of atmospheric geophysical and astronomical sciences is responsible for the training of scientists and technical personnel with respect to atmospheric geophysical and astronomical sciences in 1977 the typhoon moderation research and development office and the national flood forecasting office were placed under administrative supervision of pagasa pursuant to presidential decree no 1149 s 1977 pagasa saw a lot of accomplishments during the marcos era in 1973 the pampanga river basin flood forecasting and warning project a joint undertaking of the pagasa and the  was inaugurated and upon recommendations of a survey mission the japanese government provided the equipment and training of personnel for the project early in 1974 pagasa in cooperation with the  put up a radio station with callsign dzca through a network of automatic stations situated at strategic points along the pampanga river and its major tributaries data on the rise and fall of the river levels are sent to the flood forecasting center in the central office via existing telemetry system impressed with the success of the flood forecasting system in the pampanga river basin president marcos instructed pagasa to explore the possibility of putting up a similar system in the agno bicol and cagayan river basins.thesponsored regional seismological network in southeast asia set up an office in the pagasa geophysical observatory in 1974 it sought to standardize the training of personnel and seismological equipment as well as to improve the accuracy of determining the epicenters of earthquakes in the region subsequently in 1977 a strong motion  network was put up in  the network was designed to record strong earthquake vibrations in the area on april 18 1979 the science garden  was opened to the public equipped with a minolta  it has a seating capacity of 90 people in june 1981 the bicol flood forecasting sub-system based on the pampanga river system was inaugurated in may of the following year all three sub-systems  agno bicol and cagayan  became fully operational on the same occasion the ground receiving station for the  was inaugurated bringing the satellite meteorology of the philippines to a giant leap forward in april 1983 flood forecasting and warning system for dam operations was jointly undertaken by pagasa  and  with financial assistance in the form of loans from the japanese government phase 1 of the project covered  and  while phase ii covered the   and  as well as the data information center for the project the subsequent efforts of the government to centrally direct the integration of all government scientific and technological efforts led to the transfer of pagasa to the  through executive order no 984 s 1984 the reorganization also transferred the seismological services of pagasa to the philippine institute of volcanology  phivolc  now   phivolcs  post-1986  pagasa today 
following the reestablishment of the democratic government after the ouster of ferdinand marcos  see   in 1986 president  ordered the reorganization of the national science and technology authority  now called   and all agencies under its authority pursuant to executive order 128 s 1987 five major branches  weather flood forecasting climatology   agrometeorology astronomical geophysical   space science and national disaster reduction  and three support divisions  administrative finance   management and engineering   maintenance  now constitute pagasa this organizational structure remained until october 2008 when the agency went under a rationalization program pursuant to executive order 366 s 2004 issued by president  the rationalization program of the government was aimed at making the government focus its efforts on vital core functions and enhance effectiveness and efficiency of public service on january 15 2003 pagasa transferred its central office from 1424 quezon avenue to its permanent headquarters at the science garden located along agham road in diliman quezon city meanwhile scientific and technical operations are currently being undertaken in its weather and flood forecasting center a facility located just in front of its current headquarters on november 3 2015 republic act no 10692 or the pagasa modernization act of 2015 was signed into law by president benigno aquino iii the government will initially spend three billion pesos from the pagcor revenues  with a three-year span  for the modernization fund of the state weather bureau that includes the upgrading and acquisition of equipment new salary scheme for the employees manpower training for future weathercasters and the creation of pagasa data center among other plans tropical cyclones

tropical cyclone bulletins are issued by pagasa every six hours for all tropical cyclones within this area that have or are anticipated to make landfall within the philippines or twelve hours when cyclones are not affecting land as of may 20 2015 pagasa used to classify tropical cyclones into five categories 

tropical depression  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 30 to 60km h
tropical storm  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 61 to 88km h
severe tropical storm  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 89 to 117km h
typhoon  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of more than 118km h
super typhoon  maximum 10-minute sustained winds of more than 220km h 
tornadoes 
on august 27 2007 pagasa announced that it was putting up a tornado  days after several more powerful and destructive  damaged houses in  on august 23 2007 a 2nd tornado destroyed 30 houses in 4 villages in   the first having damaged 27 houses in  on aug 8 however as of present time the weather bureau has yet to provide such warnings climatology 
the climate of the philippines is discussed in detail on the climatology page of the pagasa website pagasa lists patterns of temperature humidity rainfall seasons and four climate types for the philippines climate types are 

type 1  two pronounced seasons  dry from november to april wet rest of the year type 2  no dry season but with heavier rainfall from november to january type 3  seasons are not very pronounced relatively dry from november to april and wet during the rest of the year type 4  rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year 
criticism 
on august 6 2010 president  announced the removal of  as the administrator of pagasa pagasa was directly under   dost  undersecretary for research and development  r d  graciano yumul a special order from dost secretary  dated august 5 2010 designated yumul as the new pagasa administrator nilo was criticized for lack of modern equipment forecast inaccuracies slow voluntary response and the aftermath of  in september 2009 and  in july 2010 doppler weather radar weather stations and other equipment 
pagasa installed its first  station in  and another in  the new weather radars can monitor the  and its movements amount of rainfall either moderate or heavy and real-time atmospheric forecasts using a visual radar monitor an example was that of  in  data are used for warnings  such as rainfall  through  since june 2012

pagasa has installed at least ten doppler weather radars in the country currently operational stations are as follows 

    in  currently under repair                 in     in  the country s most modern radar facility 
        
        
moreover the weather bureau is now constructing at least two more doppler weather radar stations in    and  it aims to have thirteen operational radar stations nationwide by the end of 2013 before nilo s leave an automated rain gauge was also installed in a telecommunications cellsite in   in cooperation with   to monitor excess rainfall as a warning signal to avert the effects of  and  by using cellphones the weather bureau plans to adopt its swift transfer of data from ground forecasting stations to main headquarters utilizing its automated data acquisition system modeled after  s  in the near future as a solution to forecast inaccuracy and their problems the  will provide modernization programs to enhance the services of pagasa include meteorology and flood forecasting and tornado warnings as precautionary measures seven new doppler weather radars placed in different locations are scheduled to operate in june 2011 in addition the weather bureau introduced its   recently invented by the   to reduce landslide casualties in case of  using this new device the sensor picks out signals in the form of computer data to show soil and ground movements and is transferred to the ground station immediately in an event of a landslide and in order to launch forced evacuation pagasa hopes to install 10 sensors in five landslide prone areas by 2012 when it is tested and ready to bury on ground another innovation to flood alerts was the adoption of an automated weather station  aws  designed to monitor amounts of rainfall and flood levels in case of an incoming warning the aws can be controlled by a computer even it is unmanned and a siren to evacuate people for emergencies few of the aws units are installed in few points of the country and many more units will be installed to extend its coverage in 2011  donated fifteen weather stations to the philippines  department of science and technology and it has been reported that  the philippines weather bureau will also share information from the new weather stations with taiwan s central weather bureau helping expand the range of taiwan s weather forecasts  pagasa and the philippines department of science and technology work jointly in the implementation of weather stations see also
