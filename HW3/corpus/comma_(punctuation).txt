comma variants 

the basic comma is defined in unicode as u 002c  comma  html 44  and many variants by typography or language are also defined 
some languages use a completely different sort of character for the purpose of the comma 
there are also a number of comma-like  with  comma  in their unicode names these do not serve a  function a comma-like low quotation mark is also available  shown below  raised single quotation marks are not shown  
various other unicode characters combine commas or comma-like figures with other characters and are not shown here history 
in the 3rd century bc  invented a system of single   distinctiones  that separated verses  colometry  and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of text when  aloud the different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom middle or top of the line for a short passage  a komma  a media distinctio dot was placed mid-level   this is the origin of the concept of a comma although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated the mark used today is descended from a diagonal  or virgula suspensiva   used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause the modern comma was first used by  uses in english 
in general the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked  to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise the comma performs a number of functions in  writing it is used in generally similar ways in other languages particularly european ones although the rules on comma usage  and their rigidity  vary from language to language in lists 
commas are placed between items in lists as in they own a cat a dog two rabbits and seven mice some english style guides recommend that a comma be used before the final   and or nor  in a list of more than two elements a comma used in such a position is variously called a  an oxford comma or a harvard comma  after the  and  both prominent advocates of this style  such use of a comma sometimes prevents ambiguity 

the sentence i spoke to the boys sam and tom could mean either i spoke to the boys and sam and tom  i spoke to more than three people  or i spoke to the boys who are sam and tom  i spoke to two people 
i spoke to the boys sam and tom  must be the boys and sam and tom  i spoke to more than three people  
the serial comma does not eliminate all confusion consider the following sentence 

i thank my mother anne smith and thomas this could mean either my mother and anne smith and thomas  three people  or my mother who is anne smith  and thomas  two people  this sentence might be recast as  my mother  anne smith  and thomas  for clarity i thank my mother anne smith and thomas because the comma after  mother  is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an   that is a renaming of or further information about a noun  this construction suggests that my mother s name is  anne smith and thomas  compare  i thank my friend smith and wesson  in which the ambiguity is obvious 
as a   style guide suggests that straightforward lists  he ate ham eggs and chips  do not need a comma before the final  and  but sometimes it can help the reader  he ate cereal kippers bacon eggs toast and marmalade and tea  the chicago manual of style and other academic writing guides require the serial comma  all lists must have a comma before the  and  prefacing the last item in a series if the individual items of a list are long complex affixed with description or themselves contain commas  may be preferred as separators and the list may be introduced with a  in  a comma might replace the word  and  even if there are only two items in order to save space as in this headline from reuters 

trump macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy 
separation of clauses 
commas are often used to separate  in english a comma is used to separate a  from the  if the dependent clause comes first  after i fed the cat i brushed my clothes  compare this with i brushed my clothes after i fed the cat  a  takes commas if it is non as in i cut down all the trees which were over six feet tall  without the comma this would mean that only those trees over six feet tall were cut down 
some style guides prescribe that two  joined by a coordinating   for and nor but or yet so  must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction in the following sentences where the second clause is independent  because it can stand alone as a sentence  the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary 

mary walked to the party but she was unable to walk home designer clothes are silly and i can t afford them anyway don t push that button or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet 

in the following sentences where the second half of the sentence is not an independent clause  because it does not contain an explicit   those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted 

mary walked to the party but was unable to walk home i think designer clothes are silly and can t afford them anyway 
however such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short typically when the second independent clause is an  as in 

sit down and shut up 
the above guidance is not universally accepted or applied long coordinating clauses are nonetheless usually separated by commas 

she had very little to live on but she would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers 
in some languages such as  and  stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses with dependent clauses always being set off with commas and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions the joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction  as in  it is nearly half past five we cannot reach town before dark  is known as a  and is sometimes considered an error in english  in most cases a semicolon should be used instead a comma splice should not be confused though with  a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted certain adverbs 
commas are always used to set off certain  at the beginning of a sentence including however in fact therefore nevertheless moreover furthermore and still 
therefore a comma would be appropriate in this sentence nevertheless i will not use one 
if these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence they are followed and preceded by a comma as in the second of the two below examples if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb then it is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma 
in this sentence furthermore commas would also be called for this sentence is similar  however a semicolon is necessary as well 
using commas to offset certain adverbs is optional including then so yet instead and too  meaning also  
so that s it for this rule or
so that s it for this rule a comma would be appropriate in this sentence too or
a comma would be appropriate in this sentence too 
parenthetical phrases 
 commas are often used to enclose  words and phrases within a sentence  i.e information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence  such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence the following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases 

introductory phrase  once upon a time my father ate a muffin interjection  my father ate the muffin gosh darn it 
aside  my father if you don t mind me telling you this ate the muffin   my father a jaded and bitter man ate the muffin absolute phrase  my father his eyes flashing with rage ate the muffin free modifier  my father chewing with unbridled fury ate the muffin resumptive modifier  my father ate the muffin a muffin which no man had yet chewed summative modifier  my father ate the muffin a feat which no man had attempted 
between adjectives 
a comma is used to separate coordinate adjectives  i.e  that directly and equally modify the following noun  adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if and were placed between them for example 

the dull incessant droning but the cute little cottage the devious lazy red frog suggests there are lazy red frogs  one of which is devious  while the devious lazy red frog does not carry this connotation 
before quotations 
some writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma as in mr kershner says  you should know how to use a comma  quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a  rather than a comma other writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway thus they would write mr kershner says  you should know how to use a comma 
in dates 
month day year 
when a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year a comma separates the day from the year  december 19 1941 this style is common in american english the comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers  december 191941 most style manuals including  and the  also recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical requiring a second comma after it   feb 14 1987 was the target date 
if just month and year are given no commas are used   her daughter april may return in june 2009 for the reunion 
day month year 
when the day precedes the month the month name separates the numeric day and year so commas are not necessary to separate them   the  was carried out on 19december1941 
in geographical names 
commas are used to separate parts of geographical references such as city and state  dallas texas  or city and country  kampala uganda  additionally most style manuals including  and the ap stylebook recommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical requiring a second comma after   the plane landed in kampala  that evening 
the  and  recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages as the marks hinder  in numbers 
main article  
in representing large numbers from the right side to the left english texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal this is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself however in much of europe southern africa and latin america  or spaces are used instead  the comma is used as a decimal separator equivalent to the use in english of the  in india the groups are two digits except for the rightmost group in some styles the comma may not be used for this purpose at all  e.g in the   a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead in names 
commas are used when writing names that are presented surname first generally in instances of alphabetization by surname  smith john they are also used before many titles that follow a name  john smith ph.d 

 the big final rule for the comma is one that you won t find in any books by grammarians don t use commas like a stupid person 

 eats shoots and leaves similarly in lists that are presented with an inversion    socks green  3 pairs  socks red  2 pairs  tie regimental  1 ellipsis 
commas may be used to indicate that a word or a group of words has been omitted as in the cat was white  the dog brown  here the comma replaces was 
vocative

the serial comma is also known as the oxford comma harvard comma or series comma it is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an americanism  but its usage occurs within both american and british english it is called the oxford comma because of its long history of use by oxford university press opinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma a majority of american style guides mandate use of the serial comma including the chicago manual of style  and  s  and the  style manual the ap stylebook for journalistic writing advises against it it is used less often in british english but some british style guides require it including the  style manual and  s  some writers of british english use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity according to new hart s rules  house style will dictate  whether to use the serial comma and  the general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently  no association with region or dialect is suggested other than that its use has been strongly advocated by oxford university press barbara child advises that  it is a good idea to put a comma before the last item in a series  but claims that in the  there is a trend toward a decreased use of the comma generally this is reinforced by an article by  in   says that general decline in usage of commas is equally true in the uk where it has been a slow steady trend for at least a century
