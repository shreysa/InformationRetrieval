the intertropical convergence zone  itcz  known by sailors as the  is the area encircling earth near the  where the northeast and southeast  converge the itcz was originally identified from the 1920s to the 1940s as the  intertropical front   itf  but after the recognition in the 1940s and 1950s of the significance of  in  weather production the term itcz was then applied when it lies near the equator it is called the near-equatorial trough where the itcz is drawn into and merges with a  circulation it is sometimes referred to as a  a usage more common in australia and parts of asia in the seamen s speech the zone is referred to as the doldrums because of its erratic weather patterns with stagnant calms and violent  the itcz appears as a band of clouds usually thunderstorms that encircle the globe near the equator in the  the  move in a southwestward direction from the northeast while in the  they move northwestward from the southeast when the itcz is positioned north or south of the equator these directions change according to the  imparted by  for instance when the itcz is situated north of the equator the southeast trade wind changes to a southwest wind as it crosses the equator the itcz is formed by vertical motion largely appearing as  activity of thunderstorms driven by solar heating which effectively draw air in  these are the trade winds the itcz is effectively a tracer of the ascending branch of the  and is wet the dry descending branch is the  the location of the itcz gradually varies with the seasons over land it moves back and forth across the equator following the sun s  at high  over the oceans where the convergence zone is better defined the seasonal cycle is more subtle as the convection is constrained by the distribution of ocean temperatures sometimes a double itcz forms with one located north and another south of the equator one of which is usually stronger than the other when this occurs a narrow ridge of high pressure forms between the two convergence zones

south pacific convergence zone 
the   spcz  is a reverse-oriented or west-northwest to east-southeast aligned trough extending from the west pacific warm pool southeastwards towards  it lies just south of the equator during the southern hemisphere warm season but can be more extratropical in nature especially east of the  it is considered the largest and most important piece of the itcz and has the least dependence upon heating from a nearby  during the summer than any other portion of the  the southern itcz in the southeast pacific and southern atlantic known as the sitcz occurs during the southern hemisphere fall between  and  of the equator east of the  longitude during cool or neutral   enso  patterns when enso reaches its warm phase otherwise known as el nio the tongue of lowered  due to upwelling off the south american continent disappears which causes this convergence zone to vanish as well effects on weather 




the itcz moves farther away from the equator during the northern summer than the southern one due to the north-heavy arrangement of the continents 

variation in the location of the intertropical convergence zone drastically affects rainfall in many equatorial nations resulting in the wet and dry seasons of the tropics rather than the cold and warm seasons of higher latitudes longer term changes in the intertropical convergence zone can result in severe  or flooding in nearby areas in some cases the itcz may become narrow especially when it moves away from the equator  the itcz can then be interpreted as a  along the leading edge of the equatorial air there appears to be a 15 to 25-day cycle in thunderstorm activity along the itcz which is roughly half the wavelength of the   mjo  within the itcz the average winds are slight unlike the zones north and south of the equator where the trade winds feed early sailors named this belt of calm the doldrums because of the inactivity and stagnation they found themselves in after days of no wind to find oneself becalmed in this region in a hot and muggy climate could mean death in an era when wind was the only effective way to propel ships across the ocean even today leisure and competitive sailors attempt to cross the zone as quickly as possible as the erratic weather and wind patterns may cause unexpected delays role in tropical cyclone formation

 depends upon low-level  as one of its six requirements and the itcz fills this role as it is a zone of wind change and speed otherwise known as horizontal  as the itcz migrates more than 500 kilometres  300mi  from the equator during the respective hemisphere s summer season increasing  makes the formation of  within this zone more possible surges of higher pressure from high latitudes can enhance tropical disturbances along its axis in the north atlantic and the northeastern pacific oceans  move along the axis of the itcz causing an increase in thunderstorm activity and under weak vertical wind shear these clusters of thunderstorms can become tropical cyclones hazards
