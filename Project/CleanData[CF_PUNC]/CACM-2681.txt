dynamic memory repacking a probabilistic model of a multiprogramming system is exercised in order to determine the conditions under which the dynamic repacking of main memory is beneficial an expression is derived for the maximum interference that a repacking process may introduce before the original performance of the system is degraded alternative approaches to repacking are discussed and the operating conditions that lead to improved system throughput through repacking are delineated cacm March, 1974 Balkovich, E.
