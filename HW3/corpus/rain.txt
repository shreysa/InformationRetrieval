air contains water vapor and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air known as the mixing ratio is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air  g kg  the amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as   which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature how much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated  100%relative humidity  and forms into a   a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the earth s surface  depends on its temperature warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated therefore one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it the  is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated there are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point  adiabatic cooling conductive cooling radiational cooling and evaporative cooling  occurs when air rises and expands the air can rise due to  large-scale atmospheric motions or a physical barrier such as a mountain   conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface usually by being blown from one surface to another for example from a liquid water surface to colder land radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of  either by the air or by the surface underneath evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation which forces the air temperature to cool to its  or until it reaches saturation the main ways water vapor is added to the air are  wind convergence into areas of upward motion precipitation or virga falling from above daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land transpiration from plants cool or dry air moving over warmer water and lifting air over mountains water vapor normally begins to condense on  such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds elevated portions of weather fronts  which are three-dimensional in nature  force broad areas of upward motion within the earth s atmosphere which form clouds decks such as  or   is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass it can also form due to the lifting of  during breezy conditions coalescence and fragmentation




the shape of rain drops depending upon their size


 occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary when air turbulence occurs water droplets collide producing larger droplets 



black rain clouds


as these larger water droplets descend coalescence continues so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing and is also known as the warm rain process in clouds below freezing when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall this generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets this process is temperature dependent as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing in addition because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain raindrops have sizes ranging from 0.1 to 9mm  0.0039 to 0.3543in  mean diameter above which they tend to break up smaller drops are called cloud droplets and their shape is spherical as a raindrop increases in size its shape becomes more oblate with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom like  buns  very large ones are shaped like  contrary to popular belief their shape does not resemble a teardrop the biggest raindrops on earth were recorded over  and the  in 2004 some of them were as large as 10mm  0.39in  the large size is explained by condensation on large  particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops

light rain  when the precipitation rate is   2.5mm  0.098in  per hour
moderate rain  when the precipitation rate is between 2.5mm  0.098in   7.6mm  0.30in  or 10mm  0.39in  per hour
heavy rain  when the precipitation rate is   7.6mm  0.30in  per hour or between 10mm  0.39in  and 50mm  2.0in  per hour
