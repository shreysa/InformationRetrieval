the designation of the vietnam unknown has proven to be difficult with improvements in  it is possible though unlikely that the recovered remains for every unknown soldier killed in the vietnam war will be identified the vietnam unknown service member was designated by medal of honor recipient    during a ceremony at  hawaii may 17 1984 each branch of the armed services took part in the transportation to honor the unknown the marines from marine barracks hawaii consisted of an honor guard of 9 enlisted men and lt denis muller the vietnam unknown was transported aboard the fast frigate  where the marines stood guard over the casket during the seven day ocean voyage to  california where the debarkation ceremony turned the unknown over to the usaf on may 24 the next day the remains of the vietnam unknown were then flown from  california arriving at  maryland once there the remains were turned over to the us army where the remains were taken to fort mcnair for placement upon the horse-drawn wagon which later carried the unknown to the capital rotunda for display before interment while on display for public viewing all branches of the us armed forces stood in honor guarding the casket of the unknown for 2 weeks

tomb of the unknown soldier guard identification badge


the tomb guards are soldiers of the united states army the first military guards were troopers from the 3rd cavalry  brave rifles  who were posted nearby on  since april 6 1948  known then as  army day  when the regiment was reactivated it has been guarded by soldiers from 3rd infantry regiment  the old guard  the old guard is also posted to  virginia adjacent to arlington national cemetery it is considered one of the highest honors to serve as a  at the tomb of the unknowns fewer than 20 percent of all volunteers are accepted for training and of those only a fraction pass training to become full-fledged tomb guards this attrition rate has made the  the second least-awarded qualification badge of the united states military  the first being the   the soldier  walking the mat  does not wear rank insignia so as not to outrank the unknowns whatever their ranks may have been non-commissioned officers  usually the relief commander and assistant relief commanders  do wear insignia of their rank when changing the guard only they have a separate uniform  without rank  that is worn when they actually guard the unknowns or are  posted 
the duties of the sentinels are not purely ceremonial the sentinels will confront people who cross the barriers at the tomb or who they perceive to be disrespectful or excessively loud weapons 
over the years there have been several different types of weapons used by the tomb guards the changes in weapons reflect the changes in the army including   and  rifles  and  pistols tomb guards currently carry m14 rifles which are unloaded and affixed to ceremonial rifle stocks these rifles are cleaned daily and kept ready for use at all times walking the mat 
there is a meticulous routine that the guard follows when watching over the graves the tomb guard 

marches 21 steps south down the black mat laid across the tomb turns and faces east toward the tomb for 21 seconds turns and faces north changes weapon to outside shoulder and waits 21 seconds marches 21 steps down the mat turns and faces east for 21 seconds turns and faces south changes weapon to outside shoulder and waits 21 seconds repeats the routine until the soldier is relieved of duty at the  
after each turn the guard executes a sharp  shoulder-arms  movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to the visitors to signify that the guard stands between the tomb and any possible threat out of respect for the interred the sentinels command silence at the tombs if the guard walking the mat must vocally confront a disturbance from spectators or a threat the routine is interrupted and remains so until the disturbance is under control the sentinel will exit the mat place the weapon in port arms position and confront the disturbance once under control the sentinel then walks on the pavement to the other side of the mat turns to shoulder arms and continues the routine twenty-one was chosen because it symbolizes the highest military honor that can be bestowedthe  the mat is usually replaced twice per year  before  and before  this is required because of the wear on the rubber mat by the special shoes worn by tomb guards the sentinels have metal plates built into the soles and inner parts of their shoes to allow for a more rugged sole and to give the signature click of the heel during maneuvers the sentinels wear sunglasses because of the bright reflection from the marble surrounding the tomb and the memorial amphitheater on the ground not covered by the mat a rust pattern in the tile can be seen that corresponds to the precise steps taken during the changing of the guard the metal from the guards  boots causes the brown rust markings on the stone on the mat itself footprints caused by standing guard are also visible changing of the guard 




changing of the guard 2005 

while arlington national cemetery is open during the day in summer months from april 1 to september 30 the guard is changed every half hour during the winter months from october 1 to march 31 the guard is changed every hour after the cemetery closes to the public  7 p.m to 8 a.m april through september and 5 p.m to 8 a.m october through march  the guard is changed every 2 hours the ceremony can be witnessed by the public whenever  is open the guard change is very symbolic but also conducted in accordance with army regulations the relief commander or assistant relief commander along with the oncoming guard are both required for a guard change to take place the relief commander orders the guard being relieved to  pass on your orders  to the oncoming guard the guard being relieved will say to the oncoming guard  post and orders remain as directed  the oncoming guard s response is always  orders acknowledged  during changes when the public is witnessing the ceremony the commander will inform the public that the ceremony is about to take place and that those in attendance should remain  silent and standing  throughout the entire event dedication 
a civilian guard was first posted at the tomb on november 17 1925 to prevent among other things families from picnicking on the flat marble slab with views of the city a military guard was first posted on march 25 1926 the first 24-hour guard was posted on midnight july 2 1937 the tomb of the unknowns has been guarded continuously 24 hours a day 7 days a week since that time inclement weather terrorist attacks et cetera do not cause the watch to cease since 1948 the tomb guards a special platoon within the   the old guard  work on a team rotation of 24 hours on 24 hours off for five days taking the following four days off a guard takes an average of six hours to prepare his uniform heavy wool regardless of the time of year for the next day s work in addition to preparing the uniform guards also conduct physical training tomb guard training participate in field exercises cut their hair before the next work day and at times are involved in regimental functions as well tomb guards are required to memorize 17 pages of information about arlington national cemetery and the tomb of the unknown soldier including the locations of nearly 300 graves and who is buried in each one a special army decoration the  is authorized for wear after passing a detailed test of 100 questions  from a pool of more than 300  a uniform test with two gigs  errors  or fewer  measured to the 1 64  and a test on the guard changing sequence after serving honorably for a period of nine months and having passed the sequence of tests a tomb guard is permanently awarded the badge since the first award on february 7 1958 fewer than 650 soldiers have completed training and been awarded this badge including four women a small number of tomb guard identification badges have also been retroactively awarded to soldiers who served as guards before 1959 those numbers make the badge the second rarest award currently issued in the united states army  only the  is rarer the badge was designed in 1956 and first issued to members of the honor guard at the tomb of the unknowns on february 7 1958 the badge was first issued only as a temporary wear item meaning the soldiers could only wear the badge during their tenure as members of the honor guard upon leaving the duty the badge was returned and reissued to incoming soldiers in 1963 a regulation was enacted that allowed the badge to be worn as a permanent part of the military uniform even after the soldier s completion of duty at the tomb of the unknowns damage and repair to the tomb monument 




the crack can be seen underneath the words  an american  and above the word  soldier 


cracking and weathering are causing concerns for the long-term preservation of the tomb monument a november 1963 report first recorded horizontal cracking of the monument s marble die block though this was the first time that the damage was documented the report made it clear that the cracks had become visible some time before that date in 19631964 there were two cracksreferred to as  primary  and  secondary extending approximately 34 feet around the die block by 1974 they had extended to 40 feet they grew another 4.6 feet over the next 15 years inspection has determined that the cracks have increased horizontally since 1990 analysis also indicates that the cracks are not surficial but extend partially through the block and will eventually extend all the way through the 1990 report documented deterioration of the marble s surface as much as 2.85mm of the marble surface has been lost through weathering the study projected that before 2010 the tomb monument will have been weathered enough to have a negative effect on the experience of the visitors and concludes the only solutions are to enclose or replace the monument several options have been considered to deal with the damage officials at arlington national cemetery determined that proper repair can return the tomb monument to an acceptable appearance however because the cracks will continue to lengthen and widen continuous grouting regrouting touch-up monitoring and maintenance would be required therefore a report commissioned by arlington national cemetery and published in june 2006 confirmed the cemetery s conclusion that  replacement of the three pieces of the tomb monument is the preferred alternative  a final decision was scheduled to be made on september 30 2007 the  objects to the plan to replace the authentic tomb monument the trust expressed concern that arlington national cemetery seeks to replace the existing monument with marble from the original quarry which experts agree is likely eventually to crack the trust has observed that the cemetery s own 1990 report recommended that the monument be repaired and that the cemetery in fact commissioned oehrlein architects to repair the stone in 2007 mary oehrlein informed congressional staff members that   the existing monument can easily be repaired as was done 17 years ago using conventional conservation methods to re-grout the cracks once repaired the fault lines would be virtually invisible from the public viewing areas 
on september 26 2007 u.s senator  announced that an amendment crafted together with senator  will be added to the  for fiscal year 2008  h.r 1585  that would require a report on the plans of the secretary of the army and the secretary of veterans affairs to replace the monument at the tomb of the unknowns the secretaries would be required to advise congress on the current efforts to maintain and preserve the monument additionally they would have to provide an assessment on the feasibility and advisability of repairing rather than replacing the tomb monument finally if the secretaries choose replacement they would have to report those plans and detail how they intend to dispose of the current monument once the report is provided the secretaries are prevented from taking action to replace the monument for at least 180 days the akaka-webb amendment was included in the bill by unanimous consent of the senate an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 defense authorization bill authorized a review of the monument s condition the bill also authorized repair but not replacement of the monument final passage of the  for 2008  h.r 4986  was signed by president bush on january 28 2008 



october 21 2011  completed repair of the cracks in the tomb 

in 2003 john haines a retired car dealer offered to donate a large slab of marble to the arlington national cemetery to replace the existing marble haines paid  31,000 for the marble slab the marble was not removed from the quarry however because imperfections were found and the block was rejected in june 2009 arlington national cemetery and the  announced that the monument was to be repaired not replaced in 2010 the cracks were filled but the repairs lasted only a few months as of june 2011 the cemetery was struggling to repair the cracks in the monument one of which measured 28.4 feet  8.7m  long with another at 16.2 feet  4.9m  in september 2011 the cracks were filled again and on october 21 2011 inspection by the corps of engineers and other experts pronounced the repairs a success see also
