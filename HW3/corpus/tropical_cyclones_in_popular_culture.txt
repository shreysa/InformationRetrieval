purpose in fiction and literature 
although many forms of natural disaster appear in fiction and literature tropical cyclones serve a number of useful literary functions because they are both extraordinarily powerful and to those who have some experience with them their occurrence can be portended several days in advance the noaa page notes that 

there is undeniable drama to hurricanes  their massive scale affecting the lives of thousands the foreshadowing of impending doom and their ponderous pace as they approach the shore this has made them ideal plot elements in many fictional works 
the strength of the tropical cyclone has made it a device by which authors explain the upending of characters  lives and even transformations of the personalities of those who live through such an event their somewhat hazy predictability also makes them a useful  an impetus for characters to set to action in some instances the storm provides cover for characters to engage in covert behavior early history of tropical cyclones in literature
