the siberian high  also siberian anticyclone  is a massive collection of cold dry air that accumulates in the northeastern part of  from september until april it is usually centered on  it reaches its greatest size and strength in the  when the air temperature near the center of the  is often lower than 40  40  the  is often above 1,040   31  the siberian high is the strongest semi-permanent high in the northern hemisphere and is responsible for both the lowest temperature in the northern hemisphere of 67.8c  90.0f  on 15 january 1885 at  and the highest pressure 1083.8   108.38  32.01   at   on 31 december 1968 ever recorded the siberian high is responsible both for  and attendant dry conditions with little snow and few or no glaciers across   and  during the  the siberian high is largely replaced by the

overview 
the siberian high affects the weather patterns in most parts of the northern hemisphere  its influence extends as far west as  and as far southeast as  where it is a critical component of the northeast monsoon occasionally a strong siberian high can bring unusually cold weather into the tropics as far southeast as the  it may block or reduce the size of  and generate dry weather across much of the asian landscape with the exception of regions such as  and the  coast of  that receive orographic rainfall from the winds it generates as a result of the siberian high coastal winters in the main city of pacific russia  are very cold in relation to its latitude and proximity to the ocean siberian air is generally colder than arctic air because unlike arctic air which forms over the  around the north pole siberian air forms over the cold tundra of siberia which does not radiate heat the same way the ice of the arctic does genesis and variability 
in general the siberian high-pressure system begins to build up at the end of august reaches its peak in the winter and remains strong until the end of april its genesis at the end of the arctic summer is caused by the convergence of summer air flows being cooled over interior  as days shorten in the process of the siberian high s formation the upper-level jet is transferred across northern eurasia by adiabatic cooling and descending advection which in extreme cases creates   that outbreak over warmer parts of  in spite of its immense influence on the weather experienced by a large proportion of the worlds population scientific studies of the siberian high have been late in coming though variability of its behavior was observed as early as the 1960s however recent studies of observed  over  have shown that weakening of the siberian high is a prime driver of warmer winters in almost all of inland extra-tropical asia and even over most parts of  with the strongest relationship over the  and significant relationships as far west as  and as far southeast as   has also been found to be similarly inversely related to the mean central pressure of the siberian high over almost all of  during the boreal winter and similar relationships are found in southern china whilst the opposite correlation exists over the  and  other studies have suggested that the strength of the siberian high shows an inverse correlation with the high-pressure systems over north africa another correlation has been noted a connection of a weaker siberian high and  when the   aao  is stronger see also
