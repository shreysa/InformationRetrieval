nature in the broadest sense is the natural physical or material world or   nature  can refer to the  of the physical world and also to life in general the study of nature is a large part of  although humans are part of nature human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena the word nature is derived from the  word natura or  essential qualities innate disposition  and in ancient times literally meant  birth  natura is a latin translation of the greek word    which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants animals and other features of the world develop of their own accord the concept of nature as a whole the physical  is one of several expansions of the original notion  it began with certain core applications of the word  by  philosophers and has steadily gained currency ever since this usage continued during the advent of modern  in the last several centuries within the various uses of the word today  nature  often refers to geology and  nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objectsthe way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord such as the weather and geology of the  it is often taken to mean the   or wild animals rocks forest and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention or which persist despite human intervention for example manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature unless qualified as for example  human nature  or  the whole of nature  this more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human  or a human  depending on the particular context the term  natural  might also be distinguished from the  or the
