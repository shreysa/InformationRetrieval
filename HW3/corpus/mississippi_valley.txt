name and significance 
the word itself comes from messipi the french rendering of the   ojibwe or algonquin  name for the river misi-ziibi  great river  in the 18th century the river was the primary western boundary of the young united states and since the country s expansion westward the mississippi river has been widely considered a convenient if approximate dividing line between the eastern southern and midwestern united states and the western united states this is exemplified by the  in st louis and the phrase   as used in the name of the  it is common to qualify a regionally superlative landmark in relation to it such as  the   or  the oldest city west of the mississippi  the  also uses it as the dividing line for  which begin with w to the east and k to the west mixing together in  along the river physical geography 
the geographical setting of the mississippi river includes considerations of the course of the river itself its watershed its outflow its prehistoric and historic course changes and possibilities of future course changes the  along the river is also noteworthy these various basic geographical aspects of the river in turn underlie its human history and present uses of the waterway and its adjacent lands divisions 
the mississippi river can be divided into three sections  the  the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the missouri river  the middle mississippi which is downriver from the missouri to the ohio river  and the  which flows from the ohio to the gulf of mexico upper mississippi

the upper mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the missouri river at st louis missouri it is divided into two sections

middle mississippi 
the mississippi river is known as the middle mississippi from the upper mississippi river s confluence with the  at st louis missouri for 190 miles  310km  to its confluence with the ohio river at cairo illinois the middle mississippi is relatively free-flowing from st louis to the ohio river confluence the middle mississippi falls 220 feet  67m  over 180 miles  290km  for an average rate of 1.2 feet per mile  23cm km  at its confluence with the ohio river the middle mississippi is 315 feet  96m  above sea level apart from the missouri and  rivers of missouri and the  of illinois no major tributaries enter the middle mississippi river lower mississippi

the mississippi river is called the lower mississippi river from its confluence with the ohio river to its mouth at the gulf of mexico a distance of about 1,000 miles  1,600km  at the confluence of the ohio and the middle mississippi the long-term mean discharge of the ohio at cairo illinois is 281,500 cubic feet per second  7,970 cubic metres per second  while the long-term mean discharge of the mississippi at thebes illinois  just upriver from cairo  is 208,200cuft s  5,900m3 s  thus by volume the main branch of the mississippi river system at cairo can be considered to be the ohio river  and the  further upstream  rather than the middle mississippi in addition to the  the major tributaries of the lower mississippi river are the  flowing in at the  in east central arkansas  the  joining the mississippi at   the  in mississippi  and the  meeting the mississippi at  the widest point of the mississippi river is in the lower mississippi portion where it exceeds 1 mile  1.6km  in width in several places deliberate water diversion at the  in  allows the  in louisiana to be a major  of the mississippi river with 30 of the mississippi flowing to the gulf of mexico by this route rather than continuing down the mississippi s current channel past  and  on a longer route to the gulf although the  is commonly thought to be a tributary it is actually not because its water flows separately into the gulf of mexico through the atchafalaya river watershed

over geologic time the mississippi river has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course as well as additions deletions and other changes among its numerous tributaries and the lower mississippi river has used different pathways as its main channel to the gulf of mexico across the delta region through a natural process known as  or delta switching the lower mississippi river has shifted its final course to the mouth of the gulf of mexico every thousand years or so this occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel raising the river s level and causing it to eventually find a steeper more direct route to the gulf of mexico the abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as  this process has over the past 5,000 years caused the coastline of south louisiana to advance toward the gulf from 15 to 50 miles  24 to 80km  the currently active delta lobe is called the birdfoot delta after its shape or the  after  the first french settlement at the mouth of the mississippi prehistoric courses 
the current form of the mississippi river basin was largely shaped by the  of the   the southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day united states and mississippi basin when the ice sheet began to recede hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited creating the flat and fertile landscape of the mississippi valley during the melt giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the mississippi watershed creating such features as the   and  valleys when the ice sheet completely retreated many of these  temporary  rivers found paths to  or the arctic ocean leaving the mississippi basin with many features  oversized  for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period ice sheets during the  about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present blocked the mississippi near rock island illinois diverting it to its present channel farther to the west the current western border of illinois the  roughly follows the ancient channel of the mississippi downstream from rock island to  south of hennepin to  the current  follows the ancient channel used by the mississippi river before the illinoian stage

geologists believe that the lower mississippi could take a new course to the gulf either of two new routesthrough the  or through might become the mississippi s main channel if flood-control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood failure of the  the  or nearby levees would likely re-route the main channel of the mississippi through  s  and down the  to reach the gulf of mexico south of  in southern louisiana this route provides a more direct path to the  than the present mississippi river channel through  and  while the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction maintenance and operation of various levees spillways and other control structures by the  



the old river control structure complex view is to the  looking downriver on the mississippi with the three dams across channels of the  to the right of the mississippi  is in the foreground on the right and  is in the background across the mississippi on the left 

the old river control structure between the present mississippi river channel and the atchafalaya basin sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30 of the mississippi s flow to the atchafalaya river there is a steep drop here away from the mississippi s main channel into the atchafalaya basin if this facility were to fail during a major flood there is a strong concern the water would  and erode the river bottom enough to capture the mississippi s main channel the structure was nearly lost during the  but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play in particular the corps of engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity these additional facilities give the corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973 which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods such as that of  because the morganza spillway is slightly higher and well back from the river it is normally dry on both sides even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood the flood waters would have to erode to normal water levels before the mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location  during the 2011 floods the corps of engineers opened the morganza spillway to 1 4 of its capacity to allow 150,000ft3 sec of water to flood the morganza and atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the gulf of mexico bypassing baton rouge and new orleans in addition to reducing the mississippi river crest downstream this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system some geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the old river control structure army corps of engineers geologist fred smith once stated  the mississippi wants to go west 1973 was a forty-year flood the big one lies out there somewherewhen the structures can t release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way that is when the river s going to jump its banks and try to break through 
another possible course change for the mississippi river is a diversion into  near  this route is controlled by the  built to reduce flooding in new orleans this spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 46 meters  12 to 20 feet  high are all that prevents the mississippi from taking a new shorter course through lake pontchartrain to the gulf of mexico diversion of the mississippi s main channel through lake pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an atchafalaya diversion but to a lesser extent since the present river channel would remain in use past baton rouge and into the new orleans area recreation

about 375 fish species are known from the mississippi basin far exceeding other north hemisphere river basin exclusively within temperate subtropical regions except the  within the mississippi basin streams that have their source in the appalachian and  highlands contain especially many species among the fish species in the basin are numerous  as well as  such as    and  because of its size and high species diversity the mississippi basin is often divided into subregions the upper mississippi river alone is home to about 120 fish species including             and  other fauna 
in addition to fish several species of turtles  such as       and  turtles   aquatic amphibians  such as    and   and  crayfish  such as the   are native to the mississippi basin introduced species
