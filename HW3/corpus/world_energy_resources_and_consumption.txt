total primary consumption in the world by fuel  2015  

world energy consumption is the total  used by the entire  typically measured per year it involves all energy harnessed from every  applied towards humanity s endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector across every country it does not include energy from food and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented being the power source metric of civilization world energy consumption has deep implications for humanity s socio-economic-political sphere institutions such as the   iea  the u.s   eia  and the  record and publish energy data periodically improved data and understanding of world energy consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total  supply  tpes  which  on a global level  is the sum of energy production minus storage changes since changes of energy storage over the year are minor tpes values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption however tpes ignores conversion efficiency overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency  e.g  gas and   and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms  e.g  or   the iea estimates that in 2013 total primary energy supply  tpes  was 1.575  1017    157.5 pwh 5.67  1020  or 13,541   from 20002012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth the use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth followed by hydropower and renewable energy renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period the demand for nuclear energy decreased in part due to nuclear disasters  e.g  1979  1986 and  2011  in 2011 expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion usd or about 10 of the world   gdp  europe spends close to one-quarter of the world s energy expenditures north america close to 20 and japan 6

energy supply consumption and electricity 

world   tpes  or  primary energy  differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers for instance when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline so that it can be used in a car and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers world final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world s primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity in 2014 world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481terawatt-hour  twh  or 13,541 while the world final energy consumption was 109,613twh or about 29.5 less than the total supply world final energy consumption includes products as lubricants asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel this non-energy use amounted to 9,404 twh  809 mtoe  in 2012 by the end of 2014 the total installed global power generating capacity is nearly 6.142   million mw  which does not include the  sets not connected to local  in 2014 world energy consumption for electricity generation was coal 40.8 natural gas 21.6 nuclear 10.6 hydro 16.4  others   solar wind geothermal biomass etc  6.3 and oil 4.3 coal and natural gas were the most popular energy fuels for generating electricity the world s electricity consumption was 18,608twh  in 2012 this figure is about 18 smaller than the generated electricity due to grid losses storage losses and self-consumption from power plants     chp  power stations use some of the energy that is otherwise wasted for heating buildings or in industrial processes

energy intensity of different economies  the graph shows the ratio between energy usage and gdp for selected countries gdp is based on 2004 purchasing power parity and 2000 dollars adjusted for inflation 





gdp and energy consumption in japan 19582000  the data shows the correlation between gdp and energy use  however it also shows that this link can be broken after the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 the energy use stagnated while japan s gdp continued to grow after 1985 under the influence of the then much cheaper oil energy use resumed its historical relation to gdp 

the energy consumption growth in the g20 slowed down to 2 in 2011 after the strong increase of 2010 the economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth for several years now the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish chinese and indian markets while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies high oil prices resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption according to  data from 1990 to 2008 the average energy use per person increased 10 while world population increased 27 regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008  the middle east increased by 170 china by 146 india by 91 africa by 70 latin america by 66 the usa by 20 the eu-27 block by 7 and world overall grew by 39 in 2008 total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours   or 474 exajoules   in 2012 primary energy demand increased to 158,000 twh  567ej  energy consumption in the  increased by more than 5 in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009 in 2009 world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1 or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent   as a result of the financial and economic crisis which reduced world gdp by 0.6 in 2009 this evolution is the result of two contrasting trends  energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries specifically in asia  4  conversely in oecd consumption was severely cut by 4.7 in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels in north america europe and the  consumptions shrank by 4.5 5 and 8.5 respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity china became the world s largest energy consumer  18 of the total  since its consumption surged by 8 during 2009  up from 4 in 2008  oil remained the largest energy source  33  despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time coal posted a growing role in the world s energy consumption  in 2009 it accounted for 27 of the total most energy is used in the country of origin since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials in 2008 the share export of the total energy production by fuel was  oil 50  1,952 3,941mt  gas 25  800 3,149bcm  and hard coal 14  793 5,845mt  most of the world s high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun s rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy some is directly or indirectly usable  for example via solar pv thermal wind hydro or wave power the total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter  see   though it fluctuates by about 6.9 during the year due to the earth s varying distance from the sun this value after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the earth is the total rate of  received by the planet  about half 89,000tw reaches the earth s surface the estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4 yottajoule   or 4  1023 joules and the available nuclear fuel such as  exceeding 2.5yj fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3yj if estimates of reserves of  are accurate and become technically extractable the total power flux from the sun intercepting the earth is 5.5yj per year though not all of this is available for human consumption the iea estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of  48 trillion and  credible policy frameworks 
according to iea  2012  the goal of limiting warming to 2c is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes if action is not taken before 2017 co2 emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017 fossil fuels are dominant in the global  supported by  523 billion subsidies in 2011 up almost 30 on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables

main articles    and 
coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century with the advent of the automobile aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity  became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century the growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973 after the oil shocks of  and  during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 us dollars per barrel there was a shift away from oil coal natural gas and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency in the u.s the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon japan which bore the brunt of the oil shocks made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world from 1965 to 2008 the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased from 2003 to 2008 coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel it is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present natural gas
