orbital launch vehicles commonly take off vertically and then begin to progressively lean over usually following a  trajectory once above the majority of the atmosphere the vehicle then angles the rocket jet pointing it largely horizontally but somewhat downwards which permits the vehicle to gain and then maintain altitude while increasing horizontal speed as the speed grows the vehicle will become more and more horizontal until at orbital speed the engine will cut off all current vehicles stage that is jettison hardware on the way to orbit although  which would be able to reach orbit without staging none have ever been constructed and the  of such a vehicle would make its useful payload tiny or nonexistent most current and historical launch vehicles  expend  their jettisoned hardware typically by allowing it to crash into the ocean but some have recovered and reused jettisoned hardware either by parachute or by propulsive landing  when launching a spacecraft to orbit a  dogleg  is a guided powered turn during ascent phase that causes a rocket s flight path to deviate from a  straight  path a dogleg is necessary if the desired launch azimuth to reach a desired orbital inclination would take the  over land  or over a populated area e.g russia usually does launch over land but over unpopulated areas  or if the rocket is trying to reach an orbital plane that does not reach the  of the launch site doglegs are undesirable due to extra onboard fuel required causing heavier load and a reduction of vehicle performance see also
