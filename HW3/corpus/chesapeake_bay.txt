etymology 
the word chesepiooc is an  word referring to a village  at a big river  it is the seventh oldest surviving english place-name in the u.s first applied as  chesepiook  by explorers heading north from the  into a chesapeake tributary in 1585 or 1586 the name may also refer to the chesepian or chesapeake people a native american tribe who inhabited the area now known as south hampton roads in the u.s state of virginia they occupied an area which is now the norfolk portsmouth chesapeake and virginia beach areas in 2005 algonquian linguist   helped to dispel one of the area s most widely held beliefs  that  chesapeake  means something like  great shellfish bay  it does not rudes said the name might actually have meant something like  great water  or it might have just referred to a village location at the bay s mouth  in addition the name is almost always prefixed by  the  in usage by local residents   the chesapeake   the chesapeake bay  and  the bay  physical geography

much of the bay is shallow at the point where the susquehanna river flows into the bay the average depth is 30 feet  9m  although this soon diminishes to an average of 10 feet  3m  southeast of the city of  to about 35 feet  11m  just north of annapolis on average the depth of the bay is 21 feet  6.4m  including tributaries  over 24 percent of the bay is less than 6ft  2m  deep because the bay is an estuary it has fresh water salt water and  water brackish water has three  zones  oligohaline mesohaline and  the freshwater zone runs from the mouth of the susquehanna river to north  the oligohaline zone has very little salt salinity varies from 0.5  parts per thousand  to 10ppt and freshwater species can survive there the north end of the oligohaline zone is north baltimore and the south end is the chesapeake bay bridge the mesohaline zone has a medium amount of salt and runs from the bay bridge to the mouth of the  salinity there ranges from 10.7ppt to 18ppt the polyhaline zone is the saltiest zone and some of the water can be as salty as sea water it runs from the mouth of the rappahannock river to the mouth of the bay the salinity ranges from 18.7ppt to 36ppt  36ppt is as salty as the ocean 
the climate of the area surrounding the bay is primarily  with hot very humid summers and cold to mild winters only the area around the mouth of the susquehanna river is continental in nature and the mouth of the susquehanna river and the susquehanna  often freeze in winter it is rare for the surface of the bay to freeze in winter something which happened most recently in the winter of 197677 the largest rivers flowing directly into the bay from north to south are

 in the chesapeake bay exhibit an interesting and unique behavior due to the nature of the topography  both horizontal and vertical shape  wind driven circulation and how the bay interacts with oceanic tides research into the peculiar behavior of tides both at the northern and southern extents of the bay began in the late 1970s one study noted sea level fluctuations at periods of 5 days driven by sea level changes at the bays mouth on the atlantic coast and local lateral winds and 2.5 days caused by resonant oscillations driven by local longitudinal winds while another study later found that the geometry of the bay permits for a resonant period of 1.46 days a good example of how the different chesapeake bay sites experience different tides can be seen in the tidal predictions published by the   noaa   see figure at right  at the chesapeake bay bridge tunnel  cbbt  site which lies at the southernmost point of the bay where it meets the  near  and the capes of  and  there is a distinct semi-diurnal tide throughout the lunar month with small amplitude modulations during spring  new full moon  vs neap  one three quarter moon  tidal periods the main forcing of the cbbt tides are typical semi-diurnal ocean tides that the east coast of the united states experiences baltimore in the northern portion of the bay experiences a noticeable modulation to form its mixed tidal nature during spring vs neap tides spring tides when the sun-earth-moon system forms a line cause the largest tidal amplitudes during lunar monthly tidal variations in contrast neap tides when the sun-earth-moon system forms a right angle are muted and in a semi-diurnal tidal system  such as that seen at the cbbt site  this can be seen as a lowest intertidal range two interesting points that arise from comparing these two sites at opposite ends of the bay are their tidal characteristics  semi-diurnal tide for cbbt and mixed tide for baltimore  due to resonance in the bay   and the differences in amplitude  due to dissipation in the bay  economy

the bay is famous for its rockfish a regional name for  once on the verge of extinction rockfish have made a significant comeback because of legislative action that put a moratorium on rockfishing which allowed the species to re-populate rockfish can now be fished in strictly controlled and limited quantities tourism and recreation

the chesapeake bay is a main feature for tourists who visit maryland and virginia each year  fishing crabbing swimming boating kayaking and sailing are extremely popular activities enjoyed on the waters of the chesapeake bay as a result tourism has a notable impact on maryland s economy one report suggested that annapolis was an appealing spot for families water sports and boating commentator terry smith spoke about the bay s beauty 

the water is glassy smooth and gorgeous his wake white against the deep blue that s the problem with the chesapeake it s so damned beautiful 
one account suggested how the chesapeake attracts people 

you see them everywhere on maryland s eastern shore the weekend sailors they are unmistakable with their deep tans their baggy shorts their frayed polo shirts their top-siders worn without socks some may not even own their own boats much less win regattas but they are inexorably drawn to the chesapeake bay i planned to spend my days boating eating as many chesapeake bay blue crabs as possible and making a little study of eastern shore locals for city folk like me they re interesting even exoticthe weather-beaten crabbers and oystermen called  watermen  gentlemen-farmers and sharecroppers boat builders antiques dealers all of whom sound like southerners with mouthfuls of marbles when they talk  susan spano  2008

while the bay s salinity is ideal for oysters and the oyster fishery was at one time the bay s most commercially viable the population has in the last fifty years been devastated maryland once had roughly 200,000 acres  810km2  of oyster reefs today it has about 36,000 it has been estimated that in pre-colonial times oysters could filter the entirety of the bay in about 3.3 days  by 1988 this time had increased to 325 days the harvest s gross value decreased 88 from 1982 to 2007 one report suggested the bay had fewer oysters in 2008 than 25 years earlier 



a cluster of oysters grown in a sanctuary


the primary problem is overharvesting lax government regulations allow anyone with a license to remove oysters from state-owned beds and although limits are set they are not strongly enforced the overharvesting of oysters has made it difficult for them to reproduce which requires close proximity to one another a second cause for the oyster depletion is that the drastic increase in human population caused a sharp increase in pollution flowing into the bay the bay s oyster industry has also suffered from two diseases   and  the depletion of oysters has had a particularly harmful effect on the quality of the bay oysters serve as natural water filters and their decline has further reduced the water quality of the bay water that was once clear for meters is now so  that a wader may lose sight of his feet while his knees are still dry efforts of federal state and local governments working in partnership through the  and the  and other nonprofit environmental groups to restore or at least maintain the current  have had mixed results one particular obstacle to cleaning up the bay is that much of the polluting substances arise far upstream in  lying within states far removed from the bay despite the state of maryland spending over  100 million to restore the bay conditions have continued to grow worse twenty years ago the bay supported over six thousand oystermen there are now fewer than 500 efforts to repopulate the bay via hatcheries have been carried out by a group called the oyster recovery partnership with some success they recently placed 6 million oysters on eight acres  32,000m2  of the trent hall sanctuary scientists from the  at the  claim that experimental reefs created in 2004 now house 180 million native oysters  which is far fewer than the billions that once existed publications
