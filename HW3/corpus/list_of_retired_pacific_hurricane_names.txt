in 1950 a tropical cyclone that affected hawaii was named able after a tropical cyclone had not affected hawaii for a number of years the system subsequently became widely known as hurricane hiki since hiki is hawaiian for able typhoons olive and della of 1952 and 1957 respectively developed within the central pacific but were not named until they had crossed the international dateline and moved into the western pacific basin during 1957 two other tropical cyclones developed in the central pacific and were named kanoa and nina by the hawaiian military meteorological offices it was subsequently decided that future tropical cyclones would be named by borrowing names from the western pacific naming lists within the eastern pacific basin the naming of tropical cyclones started in 1960 with four sets of female names initially designed to be used consecutively before being repeated in 1965 after two lists of names had been used it was decided to return to the top of the second list and to start recycling the sets of names on an annual basis in 1977 after protests by various  groups noaa made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the wmo to select new sets of names the wmo selected six lists of names which contained male names and rotated every six years they also decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the atlantic since 1978 the same lists of names have been used with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names during 1979 after ten names had been borrowed from the western pacific naming lists hawaiian names were reinstated for tropical cyclones developing into tropical storms forming in the central pacific five sets of hawaiian names using only the 12letters of the hawaiian alphabet were drafted with the intent being to use the sets of names on an annual rotation basis however after no storms had developed in this region between 1979 and 1981 the annual lists were scrapped and replaced with four sets of names and designed to be used consecutively ahead of the  the   cphc  and the hawaii state civil defense requested that the hurricane committee retire eleven names from the eastern pacific naming lists however the committee declined the request and noted that its criteria for the retirement of names was  well defined and very strict  it was felt that while the systems may have had a significant impact on the hawaiian islands none of the impacts were major enough to warrant the retirement of the names it was also noted that the committee had previously not retired names for systems that had a greater impact than those that had been submitted the cphc also introduced a revised set of hawaiian names for the central pacific after they had worked with the   department to ensure the correct meaning and appropriate historical and cultural use of the names the practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the united states weather bureau in the atlantic basin after hurricanes   and  struck the  and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced however it was decided at the 1969 interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired several names have been removed from the pacific naming lists for various reasons other than for causing a significant amount of death destruction which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and for political reasons names retired in the eastern pacific basin
