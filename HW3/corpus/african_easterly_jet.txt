the african easterly jet is a region of the lower troposphere over  where the seasonal mean wind speed is at a maximum and the wind is easterly the temperature contrast between the  and the  causes the jet to form to the north of the  the jet s maximum wind speeds are at a height of 3 kilometres  1.9mi  the jet moves northward from its south-most location in january reaching its most northerly latitude in august its strongest winds are in september while it begins shifting back towards the equator within the easterly jet  form convective complexes associated with these waves can form  if the jet is south of its normal location during august and september  is suppressed if desertification continues across  the strength of the jet could increase although tropical wave generation probably would decrease which would decrease the number of tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin

formation and characteristics 
during january the african easterly jet lies at 3,000 metres  9,800ft  above sea level at five degrees north latitude winds within it increase in speed from 30km h  19mph  in january to 40km h  25mph  in march shifting northward in april to the seventh parallel winds within the jet increase to 45km h  28mph  by june it shifts northward into northwest africa from june into october the  over northern africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream to the south of the  the mid-level african easterly jet develops because heating of the west african land mass during this time of year creates a surface temperature and moisture gradient between the gulf of guinea and the sahara desert the atmosphere responds by generating vertical  to maintain  balance the jet reaches its zenith in august lying between the 16th and 17th parallels in september winds maximize near 50km h  31mph  between the 12th and 13th parallels the easterly jet weakens and drops southward during october and november impact

the mid-level african easterly jet is considered to play a crucial role in the southwest  of africa and helps form the tropical waves that move across the tropical atlantic and eastern pacific oceans during the warm season the jet exhibits both  and  which produces  westward-propagating disturbances in the jet known as african easterly waves or tropical waves a small number of mesoscale storm systems embedded in these waves develop into tropical cyclones after they move from west africa into the tropical atlantic mainly during august and september when the jet is south of normal during the peak months of the  tropical cyclone formation is suppressed see also
