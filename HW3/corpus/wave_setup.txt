in  wave setup is the increase in  water level due to the presence of breaking  similarly wave setdown is a wave-induced decrease of the mean water level before the waves break  during the shoaling process  for short the whole phenomenon is often denoted as wave setup including both increase and decrease of mean elevation this setup is primarily present in and near the coastal  besides a spatial variation in the  mean  wave setup also a variation in time may be present  known as   causing   wave setup can be mathematically modeled by considering the variation in    radiation stress is the  of excess horizontal  due to the presence of the waves in and near the coastal surf zone 
as a progressive wave approaches shore and the water depth decreases the wave height increases due to  as a result there is additional wave-induced flux of horizontal momentum the horizontal momentum equations of the mean flow requires this additional wave-induced flux to be balanced  this causes a decrease in the mean water level before the waves break called a  setdown  after the waves  the wave energy flux is no longer constant but decreasing due to energy dissipation the radiation stress therefore decreases after the break point causing a free surface level increase to balance  wave setup both of the above descriptions are specifically for beaches with mild bed slope wave setup is particularly of concern during storm events when the effects of big waves generated by wind from the storm are able to increase the mean sea level  by wave setup  enhancing the risks of damage to coastal infrastructure references
