silver iodide is an  with the formula  the compound is a bright yellow solid but samples almost always contain impurities of metallic silver that give a gray coloration the silver contamination arises because agi is highly  this property is exploited in silver-based  silver iodide is also used as an  and in

structure 
the structure adopted by silver iodide is temperature dependent 

below 420k thephase of agi with the  structure is most stable this phase is encountered in nature as the mineral  above 420k thephase becomes more stable this motif is a  structure which has the silver centers distributed randomly between 6 octahedral 12 tetrahedral and 24 trigonal sites at this temperature ag  ions can move rapidly through the solid allowing  the transition between the  and  forms represents the melting of the silver  cation  sublattice the  foragi is approximately half that for   a typical ionic solid  this can be rationalized by considering the agi crystalline lattice to have already  partly melted  in the transition between  and  polymorphs a metastablephase also exists below 420k with the  




the golden-yellow crystals on this mineral sample are  a naturally occurring form ofagi 

preparation and properties 
silver iodide is prepared by reaction of an iodide solution  e.g   with a solution of silver ions  e.g   a yellowish solid quickly  the solid is a mixture of the two principal phases dissolution of the agi in  followed by dilution with water precipitatesagi alternatively dissolution of agi in a solution of concentrated silver nitrate followed by dilution affordsagi if the preparation is not conducted in the absence of sunlight the solid darkens rapidly the light causing the reduction of ionic silver to metallic the photosensitivity varies with sample purity cloud seeding 




 equipped with a silver iodide generator for cloud seeding


the  ofagi is similar to that of ice allowing it to induce  by the process known as heterogeneous  approximately 50,000kg are used for  annually each seeding experiment consuming 1050grams safety 
extreme exposure can lead to  characterized by localized discoloration of body tissue references
