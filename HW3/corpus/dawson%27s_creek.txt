dawson s creek generated a high amount of publicity before its debut with several television critics and consumer watchdog groups expressing concerns about its anticipated  racy  plots and dialogue the controversy drove one of the original production companies away from the project john kiesewetter television columnist for  wrote  as much as i want to love the showthe cool kids charming  setting and stunning cinematographyi can t get past the consuming preoccupation with sex sex sex  in his defense williamson denied this was his intention stating that  i never set out to make something provocative and racy  syndicated columnist  said the show should be called  when parents cringe  and went on to write  the first episode contains a good deal of chatter about breasts genitalia  and penis size then the title and credits come on and the story begins   of  commented that creator kevin williamson was  the most overrated wunderkind in hollywood  and  what he s brilliant at is pandering 
the  proclaimed the show as the single worst program of the 199798 and 1998-99 seasons by being  the crudest of the network shows aimed at kids  complaining about  an almost obsessive focus on pre-marital sexual activity  references to pornography and condoms and the show s acceptance of homosexuality the council also cited it as the fourth worst show in 20002001 former  president  criticized wb for airing dawson s creek which features  adolescent characters in adult situations  in an early timeslot while the network is supposed to be  the family network  however on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum the  offered an endorsement deeming it one of the least sexually exploitative shows on the air despite the controversy surrounding the sexual-oriented topics the show was a major critical success before its premiere  explained the buzz around the show was due to its creator kevin williamson who wrote the screenplays for scream and scream 2 and that the show might be  one of the year s tangier hits  he also found dawson s creek scenically  downright luxuriant  and liked that it  doesn t have the rushed feel of so many teen shows the edginess is in the situations not the pacing   wrote that it was  an addictive drama with considerable heart...the teenage equivalent of a  moviea kind of  deconstructing puberty   called it  a teen s dream  the  listed capeside as a television town they d most like to live in  declared it the best show of the 19971998 season and said it  belongs to the small-pantheon   and to a lesser extent  and  awards and accolades
