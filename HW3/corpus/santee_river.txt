map of the santee river watershed 

the santee is formed in central south carolina 25 miles  40km  southeast of  by the confluence of the  and  rivers it flows southeast for 5 miles  8km  before entering the northwest corner of lake marion which stretches in a long wide arc to the southeast for approximately 30 miles  48km  to santee dam a navigable diversion canal first built in the 1970s at the southern tip of the lake connects to  a reservoir on the nearby  the modern canal is operated by  as part of the larger hydroelectric project on both rivers the dam was finished in 1941 downstream from the reservoir it flows east then southeast forming the northeast boundary of  approximately 10 miles  16km  from its mouth it  into two channels called the north santee and south santee that flow parallel and separated by approximately 2 miles  3km  creating  the two channels reach the ocean at santee point approximately 15 miles  24km  south of  and not far from the mouth of the  history
