characteristics and identification 
the annular hurricane was first defined as a subset of tropical cyclones by john knaff of  and james kossin of the  in 2002 by use of  satellite imagery which serves as the visual means of ascertaining annular characteristics within tropical cyclone knaff and kossin defined an annular tropical cyclone as a tropical cyclone that maintains both average or larger-than-average  surrounded by deep  containing the storm s inner core and a lack of convection occurring outside the  for at least three hours as a result annular storms lack the  characteristic of typical tropical cyclone these features lend the storm an  appearance common to annular tropical cyclones however this definition is only applicable while a storm maintains these characteristicswhen and while a storm is not feature annular characteristics the tropical cyclone is considered asymmetric in addition to the primary defining characteristics the  pulsation the  cloud canopy associated with  is subdued once storms become annular although tropical cyclones can achieve annular characteristics across a wide spectrum of intensities annular storms are typically strong tropical cyclones with average  of 108  200km 124mph  in addition storms attaining annular characteristics are less prone to weakening as a result of  annular cyclones can maintain their respective peak intensities for extended periods of time unlike their asymmetric counterparts following peak intensity such systems will tend to gradually taper off this unusual intensity persistence makes their future intensities difficult to  and often results in large forecast errors in an analysis of hurricanes in the  and  between 1995 and 1999 knaff and kossin observed that the  underestimated the intensity of annular hurricanes 72hours out by 18.9kn  35.0km 21.7mph  an algorithm for identification of annular tropical cyclones in real-time by objective criteria has been developed and shows some power but is not yet operational transition from asymmetric cyclones and necessary conditions 




 of 2017 displaying all annular characteristics


tropical cyclones can become annular as a result of   the strong winds found in the eyewalls of storms with the weak winds of the eye which helps to expand the eye in addition this process helps to make the   often referred to as theta-e or   within the eye relatively uniform this transition takes roughly 24hours to complete and can be considered a type of  winds have also been found to decrease in a stairstep like fashion within the  which may indicate that more wind is mixed between the eye and eyewall as cyclones strengthen which helps to explain why annular characteristics are generally exclusive to storms of higher intensities the intensity of annular systems is typically greater than 83.5%of the  suggesting that the conditions in which storms gain annular characteristics are generally conducive for tropical cyclone persistence annular tropical cyclones also require low  and of the storms in the east pacific and north atlantic studied by knaff and kossin all exhibited easterly winds and cold air in the upper  suggesting that the conditions that give rise to annular tropical cyclones are most optimal towards the equatorward side of a  and within the  however warmer   ssts  are not a required for annular tropical cyclones with annular characteristics developing only within a narrow range of modest ssts ranging from 25.4c28.5c  77.7f83.3f  see also
