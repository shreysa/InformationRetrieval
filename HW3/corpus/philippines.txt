regarding the relations of early philippine polities with the various state-level polities of indonesia and malaysia legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early philippine polities with the  empire but there is not much archeological evidence to definitively support such a relationship considerable evidence exists on the other hand for extensive trade with the majapahit empire the exact scope and mechanisms of indian cultural influences on early philippine polities are still the subject of some debate among southeast asian historiographers but the current scholarly consensus is that there was probably little or no direct trade between india and the philippines and indian cultural traits such as linguistic terms and religious practices filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries through early philippine polities  relations with the hindu  empire the philippine archipelago is thus one of the countries  others include afghanistan and southern vietnam  just at the outer edge of what is considered the   cultural zone  the early polities of the philippine archipelago were typically characterized by a three-tier social structure although different cultures had different terms to describe them this three-tier structure invariably consisted of an apex nobility class a class of  freemen  and a class of dependent debtor-bondsmen called  alipin  or  oripun  among the members of the nobility class were leaders who held the political office of  datu  which was responsible for leading autonomous social groups called   or  dulohan  whenever these barangays banded together either to form a larger settlement or a geographically looser alliance group the more senior or respected among them would be recognized as a  paramount datu  variedly called a lakan sultan rajah or simply a more senior datu early historic coastal polities
