distinctiveness 
western pennsylvania is distinctive from the rest of the state due to several important and complex factors 

the initial difficulty of transportation access from the east involved many miles of seemingly endless parallel ridges of the appalachian mountains and then the broken hills and valleys of the  all of which were covered in thick forests indeed the initial method of access from areas east of the appalachians was to travel southbound outside of pennsylvania then follow the potomac river northwest through maryland and virginia and then re-enter the state in its southwest corner various methods of more direct transport were later tried including a canal system westbound over the mountains and then later the  which extended the railroad systems of the east coast west to pittsburgh and the  perhaps the best known transportation innovation to simplify access to this area is the famous  the first modern limited access highway in north america the initial problem was economic marketing of a limited number of goods that could stand such high freight costs the insensitivity of the new u.s federal government to the marketing problems in the west led to the  in western pennsylvania an event which seriously challenged the political viability of the new american nation later marketing arrangements turned to access via the  with pittsburgh a barge and steamboat center of the mid-continent today pittsburgh is still strongly oriented to the rivers  the port of pittsburgh ranks no 13 by tonnage in the usa and even surpasses the port of philadelphia in tonnage due to the heavy shipping of bulk coal by  inland on the rivers locally a system of agriculture arose suitable to western pennsylvania s rugged terrain emphasizing animal husbandry and dairying but with few exportable vegetable crops the search for some sort of exportable agricultural specialty perhaps also encouraged the rise of the sauce industry and its first location at sharpsburg in what was later to become the large  the search for exploitable resources first resulted with the development of huge  or  soft   deposits in the area for use in a growing iron foundry sector however it was not until the realization by  that western pennsylvania possessed an optimum location for a very large scale american  sector that this area especially pittsburgh became known for the industrial specialty that characterizes it today the region also had large    and  industries which took advantage of the coal and the sand and clay in local soils the local glass industry produced 45 percent of the nation s output in glass by the 1860s and more than 80 percent of the output by the 1920s the rise and subsequent  at pittsburgh introduces a host of complex economic concepts necessary to understand why that particular activity centered in this particular place including the notions of classical weberian location analysis for more than one input the pittsburgh plus system for maintaining advantageous freight costs to ship to the market  and supply innovations such as the development of the  the ore freighter as a transport vehicle and the construction of the soo locks other necessary economic concepts for description could well include   monopoly  or cartel  price equilibrium and  dumping  labor relations problems historically were frequent in the earlier steel sector and mention should be made of the  as well as the contemporary issue of  legacy costs  arising from heavy entitlements to a large retired labor force after sharply downsizing to today s level of employment other exploitable resources in western pennsylvania were also distinct one was the drilling of the  in the world at  and the rise of the us petroleum industry another was widespread deforestation of the outlying areas and their subsequent reforestation under  who instituted the first large scale government sponsored timber management effort in the usa during this time of intensive exploitation of forests a whole new sector the wood chemistry industry appeared and then later vanished finally mention should also be made of management in the forested areas of a large animal population which supports the famous  pennsylvania deer-hunting  cultural ethos indeed the first day of deer-hunting season is a de facto unofficial holiday in much of the central and northern regions of the state when absence from work or school is generally tolerated with no explanation necessary since the early 1950s a renaissance occurred in the development of cultural institutions and abatement of pollution in pittsburgh and its surrounding area the effects of this increase in  are particularly apparent in the golden triangle district of  which at one point had been plagued with so much industrial haze that drivers used their headlights in mid-day however this social improvement has not always been accompanied by a serious plan of regional economic development to assess what precisely should fill the income void after the departure of steel in addition the city of pittsburgh continues to become de-populated and has recently been put under state supervision of its finances culturally the distinctiveness of western pennsylvania is underlined by the existence of a unique local dialect called  pittsburghese  or  sometimes affectionately termed the  yinzer  dialect due to its use of the term  yins   also spelled  yunz  yinz   youns  etc  as the plural form of  you  this is probably a legacy of  settlement in the area western pennsylvanians also refer to soft drinks as  pop  while in the eastern half of the state it is referred to as  soda 
the  and the city of  give pennsylvania a port along the  this region in unique within western pennsylvania in that it maintains stronger geographic and cultural connections with western new york than it does with western pennsylvania due in large part to its identification with the eastern great lakes region rather than appalachia this is reflected in the city and county of erie sharing far more similarities with  and southwestern new york than it does with pittsburgh and western pennsylvania the erie region is also known for its distinct agriculture centered on grapes and other fruit due to the moderating climatic influence in both summer and fall of   in winter the area is often inundated with   there are also small commercial fresh-water fisheries and many streams and smaller lakes with a variety of fish to catch including yellow perch and walleye in  is the  of  the  let s roll  flight which occurred on 9 11 2001 after passengers attempted to overpower the plane s hijackers the site is an informal patriotic shrine with many hand-made mementos voluntarily gracing the area there is a movement to add the site to the national park system it is a startling coincidence that the stoneycreek site is comparatively close to the other centuries-earlier locations of military engagements in western pennsylvania such as  and the area of the  this can in part be explained by the fact that all these locations were on a strategic route from eastern settlements in pennsylvania and virginia  and later washington d.c  to the west
