history 
james parton the publisher  and co-owner  of the history magazine  was appalled by the  published in 1961 and tried to buy the  company so he could undo the changes when that failed he contracted with houghton to publish a new dictionary the ahd was edited by william morris and relied on a usage panel of 105 writers speakers and eminent persons chosen for their well-known conservatism in the use of language however morris made inconsistent use of the panels often ignoring their advice and inserting his own opinions linguistics 
the ahd broke ground among dictionaries by using  for compiling word frequencies and other information it took the innovative step of combining  information  how language should be used  and  information  how it actually is used  the descriptive information was derived from actual texts citations were based on a million-word three-line  prepared by  linguist  usage panel 
for expert consultation on words or constructions whose usage is controversial or problematic the american heritage dictionary relies on the advice of a usage panel in its current form the panel comprises nearly 200 prominent members of professions whose work demands sensitivity to language present and former members of the usage panel include novelists     and   poets     and   playwrights   and   journalists   and   literary critics   columnists and commentators   and   linguists and cognitive scientists    and   and humorists    and   pinker author of the   is its current chair as of 2016 the members of the panel are sent regular ballots asking about matters of usage  the completed ballots are returned and tabulated and the results form the basis for special usage notes appended to the relevant dictionary entries in many cases these notes not only report the percentage of panelists who consider a given usage or construction to be acceptable but will also report the results from balloting of the same question in past decades to give a clearer sense of how the language changes over time illustrations 
the ahd is also somewhat innovative in its liberal use of photographic illustrations which at the time was highly unusual for general reference dictionaries many of which went largely or completely unillustrated it also has an unusually large number of biographical entries for notable persons first edition 
the first edition appeared in 1969 highly praised for its   in addition to the normally expected etymologies which for instance trace the word ambiguous to a   ag meaning  to drive  the appendices included a seven-page article by professor  entitled  indo-european and the indo-europeans  and  indo-european roots  46 pages of entries that are each organized around one of some thousand proto-indo-european roots and the english words of the ahd that are understood to have evolved from them these entries might be called  reverse etymologies  the ag entry there for instance lists 49 terms derived from it words as diverse as agent essay purge stratagem ambassador axiom and pellagra along with information about varying routes through intermediate transformations on the way to the contemporary words a compacted american heritage college dictionary was first released in 1974 second and later editions 
the first edition s concise successor the american heritage dictionary second college edition was published in 1982  without a larger-format version  it omitted the  etymologies but they were reintroduced in the third full edition published in 1992 the third edition was also a departure for the publisher because it was developed in a database which facilitated the use of the linguistic data for other applications such as electronic dictionaries the fourth edition  2000 reissued in 2006  added an appendix of  etymological roots and included color illustrations and was also available with a  edition in some versions this revision was larger than a typical desk dictionary but smaller than webster s third new international dictionary or the unabridged  a lower-priced college edition also the fourth was issued in black-and-white printing and with fewer illustrations in 2002  reprinted in 2007 and 2010  the fifth and most recent full edition was published in november 2011 with new printings in 2012 and 2016 it is available in hardcover and with reduced print size and smaller page count  form it dropped several of the supplementary features of the fourth edition and is not available with a disc-based electronic version the university-student version was rebranded the american heritage college writer s dictionary in 2013 and stripped of biographical and geographical entries to make room for more vocabulary while simultaneously reducing the number of pages compared to the fourth college edition the ahd inserts minor revisions  such as a biographical entry with photograph for each newly elected u.s president  in successive printings of any given edition supporting volumes have been issued including the american heritage book of english usage the american heritage dictionary of indo-european roots the american heritage  dictionary the american heritage dictionary of  the american heritage  in various sizes   of special vocabulary such as the american heritage science dictionary the american heritage medical dictionary and the american heritage dictionary of business terms  plus special dictionary editions for children high-school students and english-language learners the american heritage brand is also used for a series of american history books see also
