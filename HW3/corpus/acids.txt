 a typical metal reacting with  a typical acid



an acid is a  or  capable of donating a   proton or hydrogen ion h  or alternatively capable of forming a  with an   a lewis acid  the first category of acids is the proton donors or  in the special case of aqueous solutions proton donors form the  h3o  and are known as   and  generalized the arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents a brnsted or arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of h  aqueous arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid acids form  with a sour taste can turn blue  red and react with  and certain metals  like   to form  the word acid is derived from the  acidus acre meaning sour an aqueous solution of an acid has a  less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as  acid   as in  dissolved in acid  while the strict definition refers only to the  a lower ph means a higher acidity and thus a higher concentration of  in the  chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic common aqueous acids include   a solution of  which is found in  in the stomach and activates     vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid    used in   and   found in citrus fruits  as these examples show acids  in the colloquial sense  can be solutions or pure substances and can be derived from acids  in the strict sense  that are solids liquids or gases  and some concentrated weak acids are  but there are exceptions such as  and  the second category of acids are  which form a covalent bond with an electron pair an example is   bf3  whose boron atom has a vacant  which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base for example the nitrogen atom in   nh3   considered this as a generalization of the brnsted definition so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons  h  into the solution which then accept electron pairs however hydrogen chloride acetic acid and most other brnsted-lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not lewis acids conversely many lewis acids are not arrhenius or brnsted-lowry acids in modern terminology an acid is implicitly a brnsted acid and not a lewis acid since chemists almost always refer to a lewis acid explicitly as a lewis acid

definitions and concepts
main article  
modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids most acids encountered in everyday life are  or can be dissolved in water so the arrhenius and brnsted-lowry definitions are the most relevant the brnsted-lowry definition is the most widely used definition  unless otherwise specified acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton  h  from an acid to a base hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions interestingly although alcohols and amines can be brnsted-lowry acids they can also function as  due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms arrhenius acids




svante arrhenius


the swedish chemist  attributed the properties of acidity to   h  or  in 1884 an arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of h  ions in the water note that chemists often write h aq  and refer to the  when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus a  does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion h3o  thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water examples include molecular substances such as hcl and acetic acid an arrhenius  on the other hand is a substance which increases the concentration of   oh  ions when dissolved in water this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form h2o molecules 
h3o 
 aq    oh
 aq   h2o l    h2o l 
due to this equilibrium any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration while an arrhenius base increases it in an acidic solution the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 107  per liter since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acidic solutions thus have a ph of less than 7 brnstedlowry acids

while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope in 1923 chemists  and  independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton a brnsted-lowry acid  or simply brnsted acid  is a species that donates a proton to a brnsted-lowry base brnsted-lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory consider the following reactions of   ch3cooh  the  that gives vinegar its characteristic taste 

ch
3cooh   h
2o  ch
3coo   h
3o 
ch
3cooh   nh
3  ch
3coo   nh 
4

both theories easily describe the first reaction  ch3cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of h3o  when dissolved in water and it acts as a brnsted acid by donating a proton to water in the second example ch3cooh undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a proton to ammonia  nh3  but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium nevertheless ch3cooh is both an arrhenius and a brnsted-lowry acid brnsted-lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of  in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase   hcl  and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form  nh4cl in aqueous solution hcl behaves as  and exists as hydronium and chloride ions the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrhenius s definition 

h3o 
 aq    cl
 aq    nh3  cl
 aq    nh 
4 aq    h2o
hcl benzene    nh3 benzene   nh4cl s 
hcl g    nh3 g   nh4cl s 

as with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia  dissolved in   react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh3 combine to form the solid lewis acids
main article  
a third only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by  which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer a lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species  in other words it is an electron pair acceptor brnsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers many lewis acids are not brnsted-lowry acids contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry 



in the first reaction a  f gives up an  to  to form the product  fluoride  loses  a pair of  because the electrons shared in the bf bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic  and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion bf3 is a lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride this reaction cannot be described in terms of brnsted theory because there is no proton transfer the second reaction can be described using either theory a proton is transferred from an unspecified brnsted acid to ammonia a brnsted base  alternatively ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis acid  for example the oxygen atom in h3o  gains a pair of electrons when one of the ho bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen depending on the context a lewis acid may also be described as an  or an  organic brnsted acids such as acetic citric or oxalic acid are not lewis acids they dissociate in water to produce a lewis acid h  but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a lewis base  acetate citrate or oxalate respectively for the acids mentioned  few if any of the acids discussed in the following are lewis acids dissociation and equilibrium
reactions of acids are often generalized in the form ha  h    a where ha represents the acid and a is the  this reaction is referred to as protolysis the protonated form  ha  of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton   and  respectively  note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as ha   h    a in solution there exists an  between the acid and its conjugate base the  k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution brackets indicate concentration such that  means the concentration of h2o the  ka is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions the numerical value of ka is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid  ha  and the products are the conjugate base and h  


the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker acid  the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude a more manageable constant pka is more frequently used where pka   log10 ka stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids experimentally determined pka at 25c in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material nomenclature
in the classical naming system acids are named according to their  that ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix  and sometimes prefix  according to the table below for example hcl has  as its anion so theide suffix makes it take the form  in the  naming system  aqueous  is simply added to the name of the ionic compound thus for hydrogen chloride the iupac name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride the prefix  hydro  is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element classical naming system 

acid strength
main article  
the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water  in other words one  of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of h  and one mole of the conjugate base a and none of the protonated acid ha in contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution examples of  are   hcl    hi    hbr    hclo4    hno3  and   h2so4  in water each of these essentially ionizes 100 the stronger an acid is the more easily it loses a proton h  two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the  of the ha bond and the size of atom a which determines the strength of the ha bond acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base stronger acids have a larger ka and a more negative pka than weaker acids sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids a common example is   tosylic acid  unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids in fact  functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable  are acids stronger than 100 sulfuric acid examples of superacids are   and  superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline   salts  they can also quantitatively stabilize  while ka measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound s ka chemical characteristics
monoprotic acids
monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one  per molecule during the process of   sometimes called ionization  as shown below  symbolized by ha 

ha aq    h2o l   h3o 
 aq    a
 aq      ka

common examples of monoprotic acids in  include   hcl  and   hno3  on the other hand for  the term mainly indicates the presence of one  group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid examples in  include   hcooh    ch3cooh  and   c6h5cooh  see also  
polyprotic acids
polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid  two potential protons to donate  and triprotic acid  three potential protons to donate  a diprotic acid  here symbolized by h2a  can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka1 and ka2 
h2a aq    h2o l   h3o 
 aq    ha
 aq     ka1
ha
 aq    h2o l   h3o 
 aq    a2
 aq    ka2

the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second  i.e ka1   ka2 for example   h2so4  can donate one proton to form the  anion  hso
4  for which ka1 is very large  then it can donate a second proton to form the  anion  so2
4  wherein the ka2 is intermediate strength the large ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid in a similar manner the weak unstable   h2co3  can lose one proton to form  anion  hco
3  and lose a second to form  anion  co2
3  both ka values are small but ka1   ka2  a triprotic acid  h3a  can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where ka1   ka2   ka3 
h3a aq    h2o l   h3o 
 aq    h2a
 aq      ka1

 aq    ha2
 aq     ka2
ha2
 aq    h2o l   h3o 
 aq    a3
 aq    ka3

an  example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid  h3po4  usually just called  all three protons can be successively lost to yield h2po
4 then hpo2
4 and finally po3
4 the orthophosphate ion usually just called  even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged an  example of a triprotic acid is  which can successively lose three protons to finally form the  ion although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution the fractional concentration   alpha  for each species can be calculated for example a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution  h2a ha and a2 the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph  which can be converted to the  h  or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases 



a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given k1 and k2 is known as a  a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general nprotic acid that has been deprotonated itimes 



where k0   1 and the other k-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid see also  
neutralization




  in   reacting with  fumes to produce   white smoke  

 is the reaction between an acid and a base producing a  and neutralized base  for example  and  form  and water 

hcl aq    naoh aq   h2o l    nacl aq 

neutralization is the basis of  where a  shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph 7.0 which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt an example is the weakly acidic  which is produced from the strong acid  and the weak base  conversely neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt e.g  from  and  weak acidweak base equilibrium
main article  
in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid the decreased concentration of h  in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form  the deprotonated form of the acid  in lower-ph  more acidic  solutions there is a high enough h  concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form  applications of acids
there are numerous uses for acids acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as  they may be used as an electrolyte in a  such as  in a  strong acids sulfuric acid in particular are widely used in mineral processing for example phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce  for the production of phosphate fertilizers and  is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid purifying the solution and electrowinning in the chemical industry acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts for example  reacts with  to produce  a fertilizer additionally  can be  with alcohols to produce  acids are used as additives to drinks and foods as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives  for example is a component of  drinks acetic acid is used in day-to-day life as vinegar carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles  is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids  is present in oranges lemon and other citrus fruits  is present in tomatoes spinach and especially in  and   rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid   vitamin c  is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla   lemon citrus fruits and guava certain acids are used as drugs   aspirin  is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers acids play important roles in the human body the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body acid catalysis
