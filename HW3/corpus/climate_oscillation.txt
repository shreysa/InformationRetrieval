a climate oscillation or climate cycle is any recurring cyclical  within global or regional  and is a type of  these fluctuations in    or other parameters can be  often occurring on inter-annual multi-annual decadal multidecadal century-wide millennial or longer  they are not perfectly periodic and a  of the data does not give a sharp spectrum a prominent example is the  involving sea surface temperatures along a stretch of the equatorial central and east  and the western coast of tropical south america but which affects climate worldwide records of past climate conditions are recovered through  examination of  found in    or otherwise

examples 
many oscillations on different time-scales are hypothesized although the causes may be unknown  some of them are more like a  than an oscillation  here is a list of known or proposed climatic oscillations 


the   about 30 months
the   2 to 7 years
the   8 to 12 years   not clear 
the  or sunspot cycle  about 11 years  may be discernible in climate records  see  
the  or double sunspot cycle  about 22 years
the   15 to 30 years   not clear 
the   around 50 to 70 years but unpredictable
a 60-year climate cycle recorded in many ancient calendars
the   a solar cycle of about 88 years
the  or de vries cycle  a solar cycle of about 200 years
the   a solar cycle of about 2,200 to 2,400 years
  tens of thousands of years
the  of   period around 100 000 years  see  and

anomalies in oscillations sometimes occur when they coincide as in the   a combination of the arctic and north atlantic oscillations  and the longer-term  a sudden non-linear cooling event that occurred at the onset of the current   in the case of volcanoes large eruptions such as  in 1816 which led to the  typically cool the climate especially when the volcano is located in the  around 70 000 years ago the  eruption created an especially cold period during the ice age leading to a possible  in human populations however  from  such as the   can input  into the atmosphere warming the climate triggering of other mechanisms such as  deposits as during the  increased the rate of climatic temperature change and oceanic extinctions another longer-term near-millennial oscillation involves the  occurring on roughly 1,500-year cycles during the  they may be related to the holocene  and may involve factors similar to those responsible for  origins and causes 
there are close correlations between earth s climate oscillations and astronomical factors   changes   flux     and modes of  between the ocean-atmosphere climate system in some cases current historical and  natural oscillations may be masked by significant   irregularities in  data  processes or   of substances such as  effects 
extreme phases of short-term climate oscillations such as enso can result in characteristic patterns of  and   including    disruption and extreme temperatures in the form of  and  shorter-term climate oscillations typically do not directly result in longer-term  in temperatures however the effects of underlying climate trends such as recent  and oscillations can be cumulative to  producing shorter-term fluctuations in the  and   collapses of past civilizations such as the  may be related to cycles of precipitation especially drought that in this example also correlates to the  one example of possible correlations between factors affecting the climate and global events popular with the media is a 2003 study on the correlation between  prices and sunspot numbers analysis and uncertainties 
 and other factors in a climate oscillation must obey the laws of  however because earth s climate is inherently a  simple  or  often does not create a perfect replication of the observed or inferred conditions no climate cycle is found to be perfectly periodic although the   based on multiple superimposed orbital cycles and   are quite close to being periodic  perhaps   one difficulty in detecting climate cycles is that the earth s climate has been changing in non-cyclic ways over most paleoclimatological timescales for instance we are now in a period of global warming that appears anthropogenic in a larger timeframe the earth is  from the latest ice age cooling from the  and warming from the so-called   which means that climate has been constantly changing over the last 15,000 years or so during warm periods temperature fluctuations are often of a lesser amplitude the  period dominated by repeated  developed out of more stable conditions in the  and   holocene climate has been relatively stable all of these changes complicate the task of looking for cyclical behavior in the climate   and  from the land-ocean-atmosphere system often attenuate or reverse smaller effects whether from orbital forcings solar variations or changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases most climatologists recognize the existence of various  that push small forcings beyond a certain threshold that makes the change irreversible while the forcings are still in place certain feedbacks involvong processes such as clouds are also uncertain  for  natural  clouds oceanic  and a land-based equivalent competing theories exist concerning effects on climatic temperatures for example contrasting the  and  through geologic and historical time

various  are typically in flux throughout  and some processes of the earth s temperature may be  for example during the  period large glacial ice sheets spanned to earth s equator covering nearly its entire surface and very high  created extremely low temperatures while the accumulation of snow and ice likely removed carbon dioxide through  however the absence of  to absorb atmospheric co2 emitted by volcanoes meant that the greenhouse gas could accumulate in the atmosphere there was also an absence of exposed silicate rocks which use co2 when they undergo weathering this created a warming that later melted the ice and brought earth s temperature back to equilibrium during the following eons of the  cosmic ray flux and occasional nearby  explosions  one hypothesis for the cause of the   and  may have induced ice ages or other sudden climate changes throughout the  multiple climate forcings led to warming and cooling of the atmosphere which led to the early formation of the  subsequent melting and its later reglaciation the temperature changes occurred somewhat suddenly at carbon dioxide concentrations of about 600760 ppm and temperatures approximately 4c warmer than today during the pleistocene cycles of glaciations and interglacials occurred on cycles of roughly 100,000years but may stay longer within an interglacial when  approaches zero as during the current interglacial previous interglacials such as the  phase created temperatures higher than today higher sea levels and some partial melting of the  the warmest part of the current interglacial occurred during the early holocene optimum when temperatures were a few degrees celsius warmer than today and a strong  created grassland conditions in the  during the  since that time several  have occurred including

certain effects have occurred during these cycles for example during the medieval warm period the  was in drought including the  which were active  the  plague of  also occurred during medieval temperature fluctuations and may be related to changing climates given that records of solar activity are accurate solar activity may have contributed to part of the modern warming that peaked in the 1930s in addition to the 60-year temperature cycles that result in roughly 0.5c of warming during the increasing temperature phase however solar cycles fail to account for warming observed since the 1980s to the present day  events such as the opening of the  and recent record low ice minima of the modern  have not taken place for at least several centuries as early explorers were all unable to make an arctic crossing even in summer shifts in  and habitat ranges are also unprecedented occurring at rates that do not coincide with known climate oscillations  the extinction of many tropical  species especially in  have been attributed to changing global temperatures fungal disease and possible influence from unusually extreme phases of oceanic climate oscillations see also
