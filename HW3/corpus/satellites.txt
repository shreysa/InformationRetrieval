history
  presented as a  thought experiment  in  by  was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a  by   the idea surfaced again in  s   1879  



konstantin tsiolkovsky


in 1903   18571935  published exploring space using jet propulsion devices  in         which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the  required for a minimal orbit and that a  fuelled by liquid  could achieve this in 1928   18921929  published his sole book the problem of space travel  the rocket motor   das problem der befahrung des weltraums  der raketen-motor  he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments

in a 1945  article the english science fiction writer   19172008  described in detail the possible use of  for mass communications he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet the us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense  made a public announcement on 29 december 1948 that his office was coordinating that project between the various services artificial satellites 




  the first artificial satellite to orbit earth 

the first artificial satellite was  launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 and initiating the   with  as chief designer this in turn triggered the  between the soviet union and the united states sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high  through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the  the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1 s success precipitated the  in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the   was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named  in may 1946  had released the  which stated  a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century  the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the  of the  the  s project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon in 1954 the  stated  i know of no american satellite program  in february 1954 project rand released  scientific uses for a satellite vehicle  written by r.r carhart this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with  the scientific use of an artificial satellite  by h.k kallmann and w.w kellogg in the context of activities planned for the   195758  the  announced on 29 july 1955 that the u.s intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958 this became known as  on 31 july the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957 following pressure by the  the  and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on  two competing programs  the army s which involved using a  and the civilian navy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed  initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2 the project succeeded   became the united states  first artificial satellite on 31 january 1958 in june 1961 three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1 the air force used resources of the  to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellites early satellites were constructed as   designs with growth in   geo   multiple satellites began to be built on  called  the first standardized satellite bus design was the  geo commsat launched in 1972 the largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the earth is the

there are three basic categories of non-military satellite services 
fixed satellite services 
 handle hundreds of billions of voice data and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earth s surface mobile satellite systems 
mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions vehicles ships people and aircraft to other parts of the world and or other mobile or stationary communications units in addition to serving as navigation systems  scientific research satellites  commercial and noncommercial 
scientific research satellites provide meteorological information land survey data  e.g remote sensing  amateur  ham  radio and other different scientific research applications such as earth science marine science and atmospheric research types 

 are satellites used for observation of distant planets galaxies and other outer space objects  are satellites designed to carry living organisms generally for scientific experimentation  are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of  modern communications satellites typically use   or   are satellites intended for non-military uses such as  monitoring   etc  see especially  
 are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location the relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground combined with ever-improving electronics allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time  killer satellites  are satellites that are designed to destroy enemy warheads satellites and other space assets crewed   spaceships  are large satellites able to put  into  and beyond  an orbit and return them to earth spacecraft including  of  have major  or  facilities they can be used as transport to and from the orbital stations  are satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes new classifications are used to categorize these satellites  minisatellite  500100kg    below 100kg    below 10kg  
 are  or  deployed for  or  applications very little is known about the full power of these satellites as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified  are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance biological space-production and other payloads from orbit to earth

various earth orbits to scale  cyan represents low earth orbit yellow represents medium earth orbit the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit the green dash-dot line the orbit of   gps  satellites and the red dotted line the orbit of the   iss  

the first satellite  was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in  by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1,459 artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude  and  the commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are   leo    meo  and   heo  low earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000  medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786km high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786km centric classifications 

  an orbit around the planet earth such as the moon or  currently there are approximately 1,459 artificial satellites orbiting the earth   an orbit around the sun in our  all planets  and  are in such orbits as are many artificial satellites and pieces of   by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent planet   an orbit around the planet  such as by  or  
the general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links altitude classifications 

  leo  geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 180km  2,000km  1,200mi 
  meo  geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2,000km  1,200mi   35,786km  22,236mi  also known as an    geo  geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of 35,786 kilometres  22,236mi  the period of the orbit equals one  coinciding with the rotation period of the earth the speed is approximately 3,000 metres per second  9,800ft s    heo  geocentric orbits above the altitude of  35,786km  22,236mi  




orbital altitudes of several significant satellites of earth 

inclination classifications 

  an orbit whose inclination in reference to the  is not zero degrees 
  an orbit that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution therefore it has an inclination of  or very close to  90  polar   a nearly polar orbit that passes the  at the same local time on every pass useful for  taking satellites because  will be nearly the same on every pass 


eccentricity classifications 

  an orbit that has an  of 0 and whose path traces a  
  an orbit that moves a spacecraft from one approximately circular orbit usually the orbit of a planet to another using two engine  the  of the transfer orbit is at the same distance from the sun as the radius of one planet s orbit and the  is at the other the two rocket burns change the spacecraft s path from one circular orbit to the transfer orbit and later to the other circular orbit this maneuver was named after  

  an orbit with an eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an  
  an elliptic orbit where the  is at the altitude of a   leo  and the  at the altitude of a geosynchronous orbit   an elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a low earth orbit  leo  and the apogee at the altitude of a geostationary orbit   a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4 and  of half of a   roughly 12 hours  such a satellite spends most of its time over two designated areas of the   specifically russia and the united states    a highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4 and orbital period of one sidereal day  roughly 24 hours  such a satellite spends most of its time over a single designated area of the planet 


synchronous classifications 

  an orbit where the satellite has an orbital period equal to the average   earth s is  23 hours 56 minutes 4.091 seconds  of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body to a ground observer such a satellite would trace an   figure 8  in the sky   sso  an orbit with an altitude of approximately 20,200km  12,600mi  and an orbital period equal to one-half of the average rotational period  earth s is approximately 12 hours  of the body being orbited
  gso  orbits with an altitude of approximately 35,786km  22,236mi  such a satellite would trace an   figure 8  in the sky 
  geo  a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero to an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky 
  another name for a geostationary orbit named after scientist and writer  

  a disposal   storage orbit above gso geo satellites will drift west also a synonym for disposal orbit   a drift orbit close to but below gso geo satellites will drift east   an orbit a few hundred kilometers above  that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation 
  a synonym for graveyard orbit   a synonym for graveyard orbit 



  a synchronous orbit around the planet  with an orbital period equal in length to mars  sidereal day 24.6229 hours   aso  a circular  on the  and about 17000km  10557 miles  above the surface to an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky   a heliocentric orbit about the sun where the satellite s orbital period matches the sun s period of rotation these orbits occur at a radius of 24,360   0.1628   around the sun a little less than half of the  of  
special classifications 

  an orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets  surface at the same local  such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for   and    the  of earth s moon average altitude of 384,403 kilometers  238,857mi  inclined orbit 
pseudo-orbit classifications 

  an orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain planet but is actually in  with the planet see asteroids   cruithne  and    a maneuver where a spacecraft approaches the height of orbit but lacks the velocity to sustain it 
  a synonym for exo-orbit 

  lto 
  an orbit with an inclination of less than 90 or rather an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary   an orbit with an inclination of more than 90 or rather an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet apart from those in  few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit this is because when the rocket starts out on the ground it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch   and   orbits  around   
satellite subsystems 
the satellite s functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics looking at the  anatomy  of a typical satellite one discovers two modules note that some novel architectural concepts such as  somewhat upset this taxonomy spacecraft bus or service module 
the  consists of the following subsystems 
structural subsystem 
the structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain  and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and  damage telemetry subsystem 
the  subsystem  aka command and data handling c dh  monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control station s commands to perform equipment operation adjustments power subsystem 
the power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power regulation and distribution functions and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earth s shadow nuclear power sources   have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the   19641978  thermal control subsystem 
main article  
the thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite s body  e.g  
attitude and orbit control subsystem 
main articles   and 
the attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators  reaction wheels   these apply the  and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas pointed in the right directions communication payload 
the second major module is the communication payload which is made up of transponders a transponder is capable of 

receiving  radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations  antennas  amplifying received radio signals
sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input output signal  to the proper  antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations  antennas  
end of life 
when satellites reach the end of their mission  this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch  satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a  historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite  launched in 1958  the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of august 2009 instead of being de-orbited most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a  as of 2002 the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting the major variable is the  and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon  as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges whether above or below sea level  the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78km with a range between 72 and 84km solar panels however are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95km launch-capable countries 
main article  
this list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit including production of the necessary launch vehicle note  many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them instead relying on foreign launch services this list does not consider those numerous countries but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously and the date this capability was first demonstrated the list includes the  a multi-national state organization but does not include private consortiums 
attempted first launches 


the  tried in 1957 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1958  tried four times in 19661969 to launch a satellite with its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1970  tried in 1969 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1970  after launching its first national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1975 tried in 1979 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before succeeding in 1980  have claimed an orbital launch of a warhead in 1989 but this claim was later disproved  after launching its first national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1985 tried to launch a satellite using its own  launcher three times in 1997 1999 and 2003 but all attempts were unsuccessful  claimed a launch of  and  satellites in 1998 and 2009 but u.s russian and other officials and weapons experts later reported that the rockets failed to send a satellite into orbit if that was the goal the united states japan and south korea believe this was actually a  test which was a claim also made after north korea s 1998 satellite launch and later rejected  the first  april 2012  launch of  was unsuccessful a fact publicly recognized by the dprk however the december 2012 launch of the  second version  of  was successful putting the dprk s first confirmed satellite into orbit    after launching their first national satellite by foreign launcher in 1992 unsuccessfully tried to launch its own launcher the   created with the assistance of russia  in 2009 and 2010 until success was achieved in 2013 by naro-3 the first european multi-national state organization  tried to make the orbital launches at  rockets in 19681970 and 1971 but stopped operation after failures

attacks on satellites 
for more details on this topic see  in recent times  satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks for testing purposes satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth russia the united states and china have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites in 2007 the  military shot down an aging weather satellite followed by the  shooting down a  in february 2008 jamming 
see also  
due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to  by land-based transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter s range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming also it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite s transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively
