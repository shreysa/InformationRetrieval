hurricane hortense making landfall in puerto rico on september 10


at 0600utc on september7 the depression had intensified into tropical storm hortense a reconnaissance flight around that time reported winds of 71mph  114km h  confirming the storm was strengthening early on september8 hortense struck  with winds of 60mph  95km h  shortly thereafter intensification slowed due to increased vertical wind shear by upper-level short wave in the eastern  convection diminished with satellite imagery showing a tropical cyclone with the low-level circulation exposed the short-wave soon left the area causing wind shear to decrease and convection quickly re-developed by early on september9 hortense was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward around 0600utc on the following day the storm made landfall near  with winds of 80mph  130km h  this made it the first hurricane landfall on the island since  in 1989 initially most  anticipated hortense would pass south of the island and instead strike the dominican republic after two hours hortense emerged into the  and brushed the eastern tip of    near the eastern tip of the country reported the calm of the eye on september10 land interaction with hispaniola weakened the storm slightly though it would soon re-strengthen while tracking east of  on september11 hortense became a category2 hurricane and then to a category3 hurricane by early on the following day continuing to intensify hortense reached category4 intensity on september12 around that time a developing trough centered over the  caused the storm to curve almost due northward and accelerate at 0000utc on september13 hortense attained its peak intensity with a  speed of 140mph  220km h  and a minimum barometric pressure of 935mbar  27.6inhg  after maintaining category4 intensity for 24hours the storm weakened back to a category3 hurricane while passing well east of  hortense was downgraded to a category2 hurricane early on september14 later that day the storm weakened further to a category1 hurricane early on september15 hortense made its final landfall near  with winds of 75mph  120km h  hortense weakened over nova scotia and was a tropical storm when it re-emerged into the atlantic less than nine hours after landfall by 1800utc on september15 hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while just south of newfoundland the storm s remnants merged with a frontal system on the following day preparations 
shortly after hortense intensified into a tropical storm a  was issued by the respective governments from  to the  late on september7 about 57hours before the hurricane s puerto rico landfall a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico  however the watch was discontinued at 1500utc on september8 after the storm experienced increased wind shear in the region at the same time a hurricane warning was left after having been issued for the british and united states virgin islands 12hours earlier at 1500utc on september9 about fifteen hours before landfall a hurricane warning was issued in puerto rico the downgrade of the warning on the island led residents to underestimate the hurricane s threat before hortense struck puerto rico the local  office warned of the potential of rainfall exceeding 10in  250mm  with higher totals in the mountains late on september9 a hurricane warning was issued for portions of eastern dominican republic which was eventually extended along the country s northern coastline a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the north coast of haiti to  on september10 a hurricane warning was issued for the  and for the  islands of  and   a hurricane watch was also issued for the central bahamas impact
while still a tropical storm hortense moved through the lesser antilles with significant amounts of precipitation a station on guadeloupe reported a total of 12.5in  320mm  both  and  observed 81mph  130km h  wind gusts and sustained winds of 53mph  85km h  the storm caused significant crop damage destroying roughly over 50 percent of the banana plantain further south heavy rains led to scattered flooding in  which inundated streets while strong winds knocked down power lines one man who attempted to drive across a flooded road was rescued from his vehicle seconds before it was swept away while hortense passed south of saint croix the storm produced sustained winds of 39mph  63km h  at  with unofficial gusts to 62mph  100km h  hortense dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 18.0in  460mm  in  the rains flooded low-lying areas of  on nearby saint thomas the storm dropped 7.0in  180mm  of rainfall with gusts reaching only 30mph  48km h  greater antilles 




flooding caused by hortense near 


as hortense approached puerto rico the eastern half of the circulation had a concentrated area of thunderstorms while the hurricane crossed the southwest portion of the island it dropped heavy rainfall of over 10in  250mm  in much of the territory s eastern half totals ranged from below 1in  25mm  near where the storm moved ashore to a peak of 23.5in  600mm  near  three stations broke their 12hour rainfall records and two stations broke their 24hour rainfall records  the highest 24hour total was 19.5in  500mm  in  the rainfall caused widespread flash flooding and increased river   a station along the  in  reported a  flow rate rivers and creeks across the region reached high peaks and there were several reports of mudslides sustained winds on the island peaked at 46mph  74km h  in  and gusts reached 62mph  100km h  in  an unofficial wind gust of 109mph  175km h  in the southwest portion of the island may have been caused by the  or an acceleration of winds between walls along the southern puerto rico coast hortense caused coastal flooding and beach erosion an overflown river near san juan flooded several homes across the island hortense left about 1.3million people without power and 1.1million customers without water during the storm 10,563people evacuated to storm shelters across the island 11,463houses were severely damaged by hortense the hurricane left  128.4million in crop damage primarily to coffee plantains and bananas there was another  25million from road damage there were 19deaths on the island many of whom due to flash flood drownings some 1,400,000people about 40 of the population lost power during and after the storm straining the cleanup effort in the following days and weeks with lack of air conditioning and spoiled food
