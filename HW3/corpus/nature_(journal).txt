history
the enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in german or french as well as in english britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century in english the most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the  which had published many of the great works from   through to early works from  in addition during this period the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s according to the editors of these popular science magazines the publications were designed to serve as  organs of science  in essence a means of connecting the public to the scientific world nature first created in 1869 was not the first magazine of its kind in britain one journal to precede nature was  which created in 1859 began as a  magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history the journal s name changed from its original title to intellectual observer  a review of natural history microscopic research and recreative science and then later to the student and intellectual observer of science literature and art while recreative science had attempted to include more physical sciences such as  and  the intellectual observer broadened itself further to include literature and art as well similar to recreative science was the scientific journal  created in 1862 which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled  scientific summary  or  quarterly retrospect  with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications two other journals produced in england prior to the development of nature were the  and  established in 1864 and 1868 respectively the journal most closely related to nature in its editorship and format was the reader created in 1864  the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community similar to popular science review these similar journals all ultimately failed the popular science review survived longest lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881  recreative science ceased publication as the student and intellectual observer in 1871 the quarterly journal after undergoing a number of editorial changes ceased publication in 1885 the reader terminated in 1867 and finally scientific opinion lasted a mere 2 years until june 1870 creation 




first title page 4 november 1869


not long after the conclusion of the reader a former editor  decided to create a new scientific journal titled nature taking its name from a line by    to the solid ground of nature trusts the mind that builds for aye  first owned and published by  nature was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to  provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge  janet browne has proposed that  far more than any other science journal of the period nature was conceived born and raised to serve polemic purpose  many of the early editions of nature consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the  a group of scientists known for having liberal progressive and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period initiated by  the group consisted of such important scientists as   and  along with another five scientists and mathematicians  these scientists were all avid supporters of darwin s theory of evolution as  a theory which during the latter half of the 19th century received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made nature a longer-lasting success than its predecessors  editor of nature from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995 suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal s centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of nature that drew readers in   journalism  maddox states  is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other this is what lockyer s journal did from the start  in addition maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it editors 
 the founder of nature was a professor at  he was succeeded as editor in 1919 by  gregory helped to establish nature in the international scientific community his obituary by the royal society stated   gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science and in the columns of nature he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the international scientific unions  during the years 1945 to 1973 editorship of nature changed three times first in 1945 to a j v gale and   who in 1958 became the sole editor  then to  in 1965 and finally to  in 1973 in 1980 maddox returned as editor and retained his position until 1995  has since become editor-in-chief of all nature publications expansion and development 
in 1970 nature first opened its washington office  other branches opened in new york in 1985 tokyo and munich in 1987 paris in 1989 san francisco in 2001 boston in 2004 and hong kong in 2005 in 1971 under  s editorship the journal split into nature physical sciences  published on mondays  nature new biology  published on wednesdays  and nature  published on fridays  in 1974 maddox was no longer editor and the journals were merged into nature starting in the 1980s the journal underwent a great deal of expansion launching over ten new journals these new journals comprise the nature publishing group which was created in 1999 and includes nature nature publishing group journals stockton press specialist journals and macmillan reference  renamed npg reference  in 1996 nature created its own website and in 1999 nature publishing group began its series of nature reviews some articles and papers are available for free on the nature website others require the purchase of premium access to the site nature claims an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month on 30 october 2008 nature endorsed an american presidential candidate for the first time when it supported  during his campaign in  in october 2012 an  of the magazine was launched in partnership with  as of the time it was released it had about 10,000 subscribers on 2 december 2014 nature announced that it would allow its subscribers and a group of selected media outlets to share links allowing free  read-only  access to content from its journals these articles are presented using the  system   which is funded by the macmillan subsidiary digital science  and does not allow readers to download copy print or otherwise distribute the content while it does to an extent provide free online access to articles it is not a true  scheme due to its restrictions on re-use and distribution on 15 january 2015 details of a proposed merger with springer science business media were announced in may 2015 it came under the umbrella of springer nature by the merger of  and  s   and  publishing of articles 

having a paper  article or letter  published in nature or any nature publication such as nature chemistry or nature chemical biology is very prestigious and the papers are often highly cited which can lead to promotions grant funding and attention from the mainstream media because of these  effects competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like nature and its closest competitor  can be very fierce nature s  a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works was 38.138 in 2015  as measured by   among the highest of any science journal as with most other professional scientific journals papers undergo an initial screening by the editor followed by   in which other scientists chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review will read and critique articles  before publication in the case of nature they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field as a consequence the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review according to nature s original  

it is intended first to place before the general public the grand results of scientific work and scientific discovery  and to urge the claims of science to a more general recognition in education and in daily life  and secondly to aid scientific men themselves by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of natural knowledge throughout the world and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various scientific questions which arise from time to time 
this was revised in 2000 to 

first to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science second to ensure that the results of science are rapidly disseminated to the public throughout the world in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge culture and daily life

controversies 
in 2017 nature published an editorial entitled  removing statues of historical figures risks whitewashing history  science must acknowledge mistakes as it marks its past  the article commented on the placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical abusive and torturous histories specifically the editorial called on examples of  the  father of gynecology  who experimented on african american women  slaves  without their consent and  who oversaw the  the editorial as written made the case that removing such statues and erasing names runs the risk of  whitewashing history  and stated instead of removing painful reminders perhaps these should be supplemented the article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by nature the article was largely seen as offensive inappropriate and by many racist nature acknowledged that the article as originally written was  offensive and poorly worded  and published selected letters of response the editorial came just weeks after hundreds of white supremacists marched in  in the  to oppose the removal of  setting off violence in the streets and killing a young woman when nature posted a link to the editorial on  the thread quickly exploded with criticisms in response several scientists called for a boycott on 18 september 2017 the editorial was updated and edited by philip campbell the editor of the journal when  and  won a  for research initially rejected by nature and published only after lauterbur appealed the rejection nature acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled  coping with peer rejection 

here are unarguable faux pas in our history these include the rejection of   s  work on  by   and  and the initial rejection  but eventual acceptance  of  s
