a snow roller is a rare  phenomenon in which large  are formed naturally as chunks of  are blown along the ground by  picking up material along the way in much the same way that the large snowballs used in  are made they can be as small as a tennis ball but they can also be bigger than a car unlike snowballs made by people snow rollers are typically  in shape and are often hollow since the inner layers which are the first layers to form are weak and thin compared to the outer layers and can easily be blown away leaving what looks like a  or  the following conditions are needed for snow rollers to form 

there must be a relatively thin surface layer of wet loose snow with a temperature near the  of ice under this thin layer of wet snow there must be a substrate to which the thin surface layer of wet snow will not stick such as ice or powder snow the wind must be strong enough to move the snow rollers but not strong enough to blow them apart alternatively gravity can move the snow rollers as when a snowball such as those that will fall from a tree or cliff lands on a steep hill and begins to roll down the hill 
because of this last condition snow rollers are more common in hilly areas however the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon the term snow roller also applies to a horse-drawn implement used in the mid to late 19th century  though tractor-drawn examples are still in limited use today mainly at ski resorts  to pack snow it was mainly used in areas with high snow accumulation for access for horses and horse-drawn sleighs or wagons equipped with skis or runners the implement was essentially a large very wide wooden wheel weighed down with stone or concrete gallery
