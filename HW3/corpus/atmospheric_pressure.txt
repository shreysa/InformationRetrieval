atmospheric pressure sometimes also called  pressure is the pressure within the   or that of another planet  in most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the  caused by the  of  above the measurement point as  increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation pressure measures force per unit area with  of   1 pa   1 n m2  on average a column of air one square centimetre   0.16sqin  in cross-section measured from  to the top of the earth s atmosphere has a  of about 1.03 kilograms  2.3lb  and weight of about 10.1   2.3  that weight  across one square centimeter  is a pressure of 10.1 n cm2 or 101kn m2  kpa  a column 1 square inch  6.5cm2  in cross-section would have a weight of about 14.7lb  6.7kg  or about 65.4n

mechanism 

atmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet the radius of the surface and the amount of gas and its vertical distribution in the atmosphere  it is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity density variations due to temperature and variations in composition the   symbol  atm  is a  defined as 101325  1.01325bar  equivalent to 760    29.92  and 14.696  mean sea level pressure

the mean sea level pressure  mslp  is the average atmospheric pressure at  this is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio television and newspapers or on the  when  in the home are set to match the local weather reports they measure pressure adjusted to sea level not the actual local atmospheric pressure the  in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment average sea-level pressure is 1013.25mbar  101.325kpa  29.921inhg  760.00mmhg  in aviation weather reports    is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals  1 hectopascal   1 millibar  except in the   and  where it is reported in inches  to two decimal places  of  the united states and canada also report sea level pressure slp which is adjusted to sea level by a different method in the remarks section not in the internationally transmitted part of the code in hectopascals or millibars however in canada s public weather reports sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals in the us weather code remarks three digits are all that are transmitted  decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted  1013.2mbar  101.32kpa  is transmitted as 132  1000.0mbar  100.00kpa  is transmitted as 000  998.7 mbar is transmitted as 987  etc the highest sea-level pressure on  occurs in  where the  often attains a sea-level pressure above 1050mbar  105kpa  31inhg  with record highs close to 1085mbar  108.5kpa  32.0inhg  the lowest measurable sea-level pressure is found at the centers of  and  with a record low of 870mbar  87kpa  26inhg   see   altitude variation

variation in atmospheric pressure with altitude computed for 15c and 0 relative humidity 





this plastic bottle was sealed at approximately 14,000 feet  4,300m  altitude and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure at 9,000 feet  2,700m  and 1,000 feet  300m  as it was brought down towards sea level 

pressure varies smoothly from the earth s surface to the top of the  although the pressure changes with the weather nasa has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round as altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases one can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure the graph at right was developed for a temperature of 15c and a relative humidity of 0 at low altitudes above sea level the pressure decreases by about 1.2kpa for every 100metres for higher altitudes within the  the following equation  the   relates atmospheric pressure p to altitude h

atmospheric pressure varies widely on earth and these changes are important in studying  and  see  for the effects of air pressure variations on weather atmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal  twice-daily  cycle caused by global  this effect is strongest in tropical zones with an amplitude of a few millibars and almost zero in polar areas these variations have two superimposed cycles a circadian  24h  cycle and semi-circadian  12h  cycle records 
the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on earth  above 750 meters  was 1085.7hpa  32.06inhg  measured in  on 19 december 2001 the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded  below 750 meters  was at agata in  russia  6653n 9328e elevation  261m 856ft  on 31 december 1968 of 1083.8hpa  32.005inhg  the discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions  assuming a standard lapse rate  associated with reduction of sea level from high elevations the  the lowest place on earth at 430 metres  1,410ft  below sea level has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1065 hpa the lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870hpa  0.858atm  25.69inhg  set on 12 october 1979 during  in the western pacific ocean the measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraft measurement based on depth of water 
one atmosphere  101kpa or 14.7psi  is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of fresh water of approximately 10.3m  33.8ft  thus a diver 10.3m underwater experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres  1atm of air plus 1atm of water  conversely 10.3m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using  under standard atmospheric conditions low pressures such as  lines are sometimes specified in  typically written as w.c  water column  or w.g  inches water gauge  a typical gas-using residential appliance in the us is rated for a maximum of 14w.c which is approximately 35  similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on   or metres are now less commonly used boiling point of water 







pure water  at 100c  212f  at earth s standard atmospheric pressure the boiling point is the temperature at which the  is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the water because of this the boiling point of water is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure cooking at high elevations therefore requires adjustments to recipes a rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils  in the mid-19th century this method was used by explorers measurement and maps 
an important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices while in 1774 maskelyne was confirming newton s theory of gravitation at and on schiehallion in scotland  using plumb bob deviation to show the effect of  gravity  and accurately measure elevation william roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm his height determinations the agreement being to within one meter  3.28 feet  this was then a useful tool for survey work and map making and long has continued to be useful it was part of the  application of science  which gave practical people the insight that applied science could easily and relatively cheaply be  useful  see also
