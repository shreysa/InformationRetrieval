on september 22 the cyclone intensified to attain category 2 strength and became a major hurricane of category 3 status shortly thereafter as it turned towards the northeast several ships penetrated the storm s center during its passage through the gulf the hurricane also moved over two experimental buoys which recorded data on the storm aiding meteorologists in their forecasts hurricane eloise continued to strengthen until it reached its peak winds of 125mph  205km h  and a minimum  of about 955 mbar  hpa  28.2 inhg  it moved ashore along the  near  on september 23 shortly after making landfall the hurricane rapidly degenerated just six hours later it had weakened into a tropical storm while situated over eastern  it further weakened into a tropical depression at 0000 utc on september 24 the depression transitioned into an  over  and became indistinguishable by later that same day the remnant moisture however merged with a  to produce widespread and heavy precipitation preparations 
in advance of hurricane eloise warnings for heavy rainfall and potential flooding were issued for  and the virgin islands a  was declared for parts of the dominican republic about 12 hours before landfall a  hurricane emergency  was put into effect for the  of cuba while a  state of alert  was issued for the   suspended all flights to oriente on and before september 15 there was still uncertainty as to whether eloise would impact the united states however officials in florida began taking precautionary measures when the storm entered the gulf of mexico forecasters suggested that the storm would continue northward and strike the area near  contrary to predictions by late on september 22 the storm had turned northeast and some residents of florida were still unaware of the storm s threat despite the issuance of hurricane warnings 24 hours in advance as a result evacuations were delayed to an extent during the morning hours of september 23 civil preparedness workers drove through coastal towns with loudspeakers advising people to seek shelter due of the intensity of the approaching hurricane evacuations along the coast were ultimately thorough despite the initial delay it was reported that 99 of  residents along the beach had left their homes and overall 100,000 people evacuated from areas in louisiana through florida a statement issued by the  advised people in nine florida counties to complete hurricane preparations which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners while offshore workers were removed from oil platforms a spokesman for  reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated in new orleans emergency equipment was readied and inspected the new orleans levee board went into a second-stage alert on september 21 and cleared debris from floodwall openings impact
