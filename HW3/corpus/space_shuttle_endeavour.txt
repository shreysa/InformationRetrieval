the orbiter is named after the british  the ship which took captain  on his  of discovery  17681771  this is why the name is spelled in the  manner rather than the   endeavor  this has caused confusion including when nasa itself misspelled a sign on the launch pad in 2007 the space shuttle carried a piece of the original wood from cooks ship inside the cockpit the name also honored endeavour the  of  which was also named after cook s ship endeavour was named through a national competition involving students in elementary and secondary schools entries included an essay about the name the story behind it and why it was appropriate for a nasa shuttle and the project that supported the name endeavour was the most popular entry accounting for almost one-third of the state-level winners the national winners were senatobia middle school in  in the elementary division and  in  in the upper school division they were honored at several ceremonies in washington d.c including a white house ceremony where then-president  presented awards to each school endeavour was delivered by  space transportation systems division in may 1991 and first launched a year later in may 1992 on  rockwell international claimed that it had made no profit on space shuttle endeavour despite construction costing us 2.2billion on its first mission it captured and redeployed the stranded  vi communications satellite the first african-american woman astronaut  was launched into space on the mission  on september 12 1992 endeavour flew the first servicing mission  for the  in 1993 in 1997 it was withdrawn from service for eight months for a retrofit including installation of a new airlock in december 1998 it delivered the  to the  endeavour s last orbiter major modification period began in december 2003 and ended on october 6 2005 during this time endeavour received major hardware upgrades including a new multi-functional electronic display system often referred to as a  and an advanced  receiver along with safety upgrades recommended by the   caib  for the shuttle s return to flight following the   during reentry on 1 february 2003 the  mission endeavour s first since the refit included astronaut  formerly assigned to the  but now a full member of the astronaut corps as part of the crew morgan was the backup for  who was on the ill-fated mission  in 1986 early milestones

as it was constructed later endeavour was built with new hardware designed to improve and expand orbiter capabilities most of this equipment was later incorporated into the other three orbiters during out-of-service major inspection and modification programs endeavours upgrades include 

a 40-foot  12m  diameter  that reduced the orbiter s  by 1,000 to 2,000 feet  300 to 610m  the plumbing and electrical connections needed for   edo  modifications to allow up to a 28-day mission  although a 28-day mission was never attempted  the record is  which was set by   updated avionics systems that included advanced  improved  and  systems enhanced master events controllers and multiplexer-demultiplexers a solid-state  and improved nose wheel steering mechanisms an improved version of the   apus  that provided power to operate the shuttle s hydraulic systems 
modifications resulting from a 20052006 refit of endeavour included 

the   sspts  which converted 8 kilowatts of dc power from the iss main voltage of 120vdc to the orbiter bus voltage of 28vdc this upgrade allowed endeavour to remain on-orbit while docked at iss for an additional 3 to 4-day duration the corresponding power equipment was added to the iss during the  station assembly mission and endeavour flew with sspts capability during  
final flights

endeavour flew its final mission sts-134 to the   iss  in may 2011 after the conclusion of sts-134 endeavour was formally decommissioned sts-134 was intended to launch in late 2010 but on july 1 nasa released a statement saying the endeavour mission was rescheduled for february 27 2011  the target dates were adjusted because critical payload hardware for sts-133 will not be ready in time to support the previously planned 16 september launch  nasa said in a statement with the discovery launch moving to november endeavour mission  cannot fly as planned so the next available launch window is in february 2011  nasa said adding that the launch dates were subject to change 
the launch was further postponed until april to avoid a scheduling conflict with a russian supply vehicle heading for the international space station sts-134 did not launch until 16 may at 08 56  endeavour landed at the  at 06 34  on june 1 2011 completing its final mission it was the 25th night landing of a shuttle over its flight career endeavour flew 122,883,151 miles and spent 299 days in space during endeavour s last mission the russian spacecraft soyuz tma-20 departed from the iss and paused at a distance of 200 meters italian astronaut paolo nespoli took a series of photographs and videos of the iss with endeavour docked this was the second time a shuttle was photographed docked and the first time since 1996 commander  was the last astronaut off endeavour after the landing and the crew stayed on the landing strip to sign autographs and pose for pictures 
sts-134 was the penultimate space shuttle mission   was added to the schedule in january 2011 and in july atlantis flew for the final time decommissioning

endeavour on display at the california science center


after more than twenty organizations submitted proposals to nasa for the display of an orbiter nasa announced that endeavour would go to the  in los angeles after low level flyovers above nasa and civic landmarks across the country and in california it was delivered to  on september 21 2012 the orbiter was slowly and carefully transported through the streets of los angeles and  three weeks later from october 1114 along la tijera manchester crenshaw and martin luther king jr boulevards to its final destination at the california science center in  endeavour encountered a few obstacles while transiting the streets narrowly missing telephone poles apartment buildings and other structures the lack of obstacles was due in part to the fact that over 400 old-growth shade trees had been cut down beforehand the power had to be turned off and power carrying poles had to be removed temporarily as the orbiter crept along manchester to prairie avenue then crenshaw boulevard news crews lined the streets along the path with visible news personalities in the news trucks there were several police escorts as well as considerable security helping to control the large crowds gathered endeavour was parked for a few hours at the  where it was available for viewing the journey was famous for an unmodified  pickup truck pulling the space shuttle across the  bridge the space shuttle was mainly carried by four self-propelled robotic dollies throughout the 12 mile journey however due to bridge weight restrictions the space shuttle was moved onto the dolly towed by the tundra after it had completely crossed the bridge the space shuttle was returned to the robotic dollies the footage was later used in a commercial for the  having taken longer than expected endeavour finally reached the science center on october 14 the exhibit was opened to the public on october 30 2012 at the temporary samuel oschin space shuttle endeavour display pavilion of the museum a new addition to the science center called the  air and space center is under construction as endeavour s permanent home planned for a 2017 opening endeavour will be mounted vertically with an external tank and a pair of solid rocket boosters in the shuttle stack configuration one payload door will be open to reveal a demonstration payload inside after its decommissioning endeavour s   formally the  shuttle remote manipulator system  was removed in order to be sent to the canadian space agencys  in   a suburb of montreal where it was to be placed on display in a canadian poll on which science or aerospace museum should be selected to display the canadarm originally built by  the canadian space agencys headquarters placed third to last with only 35 out of 638 votes endeavour s canadarm has since gone on permanent display at the  in  in august 2015 nasa engineers went to work on removing a few of the tanks from endeavour so that they may be used as storage containers for potable water on the international space station flights
the flow director was responsible for the overall preparation of the shuttle for launch and processing it after landing and remained permanently assigned to head the spacecraft s ground crew while the astronaut flight crews changed for every mission each shuttle s flow director was supported by a vehicle manager for the same spacecraft space shuttle endeavour s flow directors were
