the remnants of  from the pacific which had lasted for two days in the  moved west over the  on november 5 the remnants of this system contributed to the development of a new depression in the central  on the morning of november 8 the depression intensified as it moved slowly northward and the  upgraded it to a cyclonic storm the next day no country in the region had ever  tropical cyclones during this time so no new identity was given the storm became nearly stationary that evening near 14.5n 87e but began to accelerate to the north on november 10 the storm further intensified into a severe cyclonic storm on november 11 and began to turn towards the northeast as it approached the head of the bay it developed a clear  and reached its peak later that day with 3-minute sustained winds of 185km h  115mph  and a central pressure of 918 the cyclone made  on the  coastline during the evening of november 12 around the same time as the local  once over land the system began to weaken  it degraded to a cyclonic storm on november 13 when it was about 100km  62mi  south-southeast of  the storm then rapidly weakened into a remnant low over southern  that evening preparations 
the indian government received many ship reports from the bay of bengal giving meteorological information on the cyclone but as  were generally hostile the information was not passed on to the pakistani government a large part of the population was reportedly taken by surprise by the storm there were indications that the storm warning system that existed in east pakistan was not used properly which probably cost tens of thousands of lives the  issued a report calling for  danger preparedness  in the coastal regions in danger during the day on november 12 as the storm neared the coast a  great danger signal  was broadcast on pakistan radio survivors later said that this meant little to them but that they had recognised a no 1 warning signal as representing the greatest possible threat following two previously  in october 1960 which killed at least 16,000people in east pakistan the pakistani government contacted the american government for assistance in developing a system to avert future disasters gordon dunn the director of the  at the time carried out a detailed study and submitted his report in 1961 however the government did not carry out all of the recommendations dunn had listed impact 
although the north indian ocean is the least active of the  the coast of the bay of bengal is particularly vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones the exact  will never be known but it is estimated to be 300,000 to 500,000people in total the bhola cyclone was not the most powerful of these however  the  was significantly stronger when it made  in the same general area as a category 5-equivalent cyclone with 260km h  160mph  winds the bhola cyclone is nonetheless the deadliest  on record and is one of the   in recent history a comparable number of people died as a result of the  and the  but because of uncertainty in the number of deaths in all three disasters it may never be known which one was the deadliest east pakistan 

the meteorological station in  95km  59mi  to the east of where the storm made landfall recorded winds of 144km h  89mph  before its  was blown off at about 2200 utc a ship anchored in the port in the same area recorded a peak gust of 222km h  138mph  about 45minutes later as the storm made landfall it caused a 10-metre  33ft  high  at the  in the port at chittagong the  peaked at about 4m  13ft  above the average sea level 1.2m  3.9ft  of which was the storm surge pakistani radio reported that there were no survivors on the 13 islands near chittagong a flight over the area showed the devastation was complete throughout the southern half of bhola island and the rice crops of   and the nearby mainland coastline were destroyed several seagoing vessels in the ports of chittagong and  were reported damaged and the airports at chittagong and  were under 1m  3.3ft  of water for several hours over 3.6million people were directly affected by the cyclone and the total damage from the storm was estimated at  86.4million  1970 usd  450million 2006usd  the survivors claimed that approximately 85 of homes in the area were destroyed or severely damaged with the greatest destruction occurring along the coast ninety percent of marine fishermen in the region suffered heavy losses including the destruction of 9,000 offshore fishing boats of the 77,000 onshore fishermen 46,000 were killed by the cyclone and 40 of the survivors were affected severely in total approximately 65 of the fishing capacity of the coastal region was destroyed by the storm in a region where about 80 of the protein consumed comes from fish agricultural damage was similarly severe with the loss of  63million worth of crops and 280,000 cattle three months after the storm 75 of the population was receiving food from relief workers and over 150,000 relied upon aid for half of their food india 
the cyclone brought widespread rain to the  with very heavy rain falling in places on november 8 and 9  recorded 130mm  5.1in  of rain on november 8 and there were a number of floods on the islands the mv mahajagmitra a 5,500-ton freighter en route from  to  was sunk by the storm on november 12 with the loss of all 50people on board the ship sent out a distress signal and reported experiencing hurricane-force winds before it sank there was also widespread rain in  and southern  the rain caused damage to housing and crops in both indian states with the worst damage occurring in the southernmost districts death toll 
two medical relief surveys were carried out by the pakistan cholera research laboratory  the first in november and the second in february and march the purpose of the first survey was to establish the immediate medical needs in the affected regions and the second more detailed survey was designed as the basis for long-term relief and recovery planning in the second survey approximately 1.4 of the area s population was studied the first survey concluded that the surface water in most of the affected regions had a comparable salt content to that drawn from wells except in  where the water was almost undrinkable with a salt content of up to 0.5 the  was estimated at 14.2%equivalent to a death toll of 240,000 cyclone-related  was generally restricted to minor injuries but a phenomenon dubbed   was observed this consisted of severe  on the limbs and chest caused by survivors clinging to trees to withstand the storm surge initially there were fears of an outbreak of  and  in the weeks following the storm but the survey found no evidence of an epidemic of   or any other disease in the region affected by the storm the totals from the second survey were likely a considerable underestimate as several groups were not included the 100,000migrant workers who were collecting the rice harvest families who were completely wiped out by the storm and those who had migrated out of the region in the three months were not included and by excluding these groups the risk of hearsay and exaggeration was reduced the survey concluded that the overall death toll was at minimum 224,000 the worst effects were felt in  where the mortality was 46.3 corresponding to approximately 77,000 deaths in  alone the mean mortality throughout the affected region was 16.5 the results showed that the highest survival rate was for adult males aged 1549 while more than half the deaths were children under ten who only formed a third of the pre-cyclone population this suggests that the young old and sick were at highest risk of perishing in the cyclone and its surge in the months after the storm the mortality of the middle-aged was lower in the cyclone area than in the  region near  this reflected the storm s toll on the less healthy individuals aftermath


there have been mistakes there have been delays but by and large i m very satisfied that everything is being done and will be done 

the day after the storm struck the coast three pakistani gunboats and a hospital ship carrying medical personnel and supplies left  for the islands of   and  teams from the pakistani army reached many of the stricken areas in the two days following the landfall of the cyclone pakistani president  returned from a state visit to china and overflew the disaster area on november 16 the president ordered  no effort to be spared  to relieve the victims he also ordered that all flags should be flown at  and announced a day of national mourning on november 21 a week after the cyclone struck land in the ten days following the cyclone one military transport aircraft and three crop-dusting aircraft were assigned to relief work by the pakistani government the pakistani government said it was unable to transfer military helicopters from west pakistan as the indian government did not grant clearance to cross the intervening indian territory a charge the indian government denied by november 24 the pakistani government had allocated a further  116million to finance relief operations in the disaster area yahya khan arrived in  to take charge of the relief operations on november 24 the governor of east pakistan vice admiral  denied charges that the armed forces had not acted quickly enough and said supplies were reaching all parts of the disaster area except for some small pockets a week after the cyclone s landfall president khan conceded that his government had made  slips  and  mistakes  in its handling of the relief efforts he said there was a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the disaster he also said that the general election slated for december 7 would take place on time although eight or nine of the worst affected districts might experience delays denying rumours that the election would be postponed as the conflict between east and west pakistan developed in march the dhaka offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed for at least two weeks first by a  and then by a ban on government work in east pakistan by the  relief work continued in the field but the long-term planning was curtailed criticism of government response 


we have a large army but it is left to the  to bury our dead 

political leaders in east pakistan were deeply critical of the central government s initial response to the disaster a statement released by eleven political leaders in  ten days after the cyclone hit charged the government with  gross neglect callous indifference and utter indifference  they also accused the president of playing down the news coverage on november 19 students held a march in dhaka in protest of the speed of the government response and  addressed a rally of 50,000people on november 24 when he accused the president of inefficiency and demanded his resignation the president s political opponents accused him of bungling the efforts and some demanded his resignation the  began to operate independently of the government as the result of a dispute that arose after the red crescent took possession of 20 rafts donated by the  a pesticide company had to wait two days before it received permission for two of its  which were already in the country to carry out supply drops in the affected regions the pakistani government only deployed a single helicopter to relief operations with  later stating that there was no point deploying any helicopters from west pakistan as they were unable to carry supplies a reporter for the  spent a week in the worst hit areas in early january and saw none of the tents supplied by relief agencies being used to house survivors and commented that the grants for building new houses were insufficient the pakistan observer regularly carried front-page stories with headlines like  no relief coordination  whilst publishing government statements saying  relief operations are going smoothly  in january the coldest period of the year in east pakistan the national relief and rehabilitation committee headed by the editor of  said thousands of survivors from the storm were  passing their days under  open sky  a spokesman said families who were made homeless by the cyclone were receiving up to 250  55 in 1971 dollars   325 in 2017  to rebuild but that resources were scarce and he feared the survivors would  eat the cash  political consequences 




the first  of 


the  headed by  swept to a landslide victory in the national elections in december 1970 in part because of dissatisfaction over failure of the relief efforts by the national government the elections for nine national assembly and eighteen provincial assembly seats had to be postponed until january 18 as a result of the storm the government s handling of the relief efforts helped exacerbate the bitterness felt in east pakistan swelling the resistance movement there funds only slowly got through and transport was slow in bringing supplies to the devastated regions as tensions increased in march foreign personnel evacuated because of fears of violence the situation deteriorated further and developed into the  in march this conflict widened into the  in december and concluded with the creation of  this was one of the first times that a natural event helped to trigger a civil war international response

assistance for the relief efforts the pakistani government refused to allow the indians to send supplies into east pakistan by air forcing them to be transported slowly by road instead the indian government also said that the pakistanis refused an offer of military aircraft helicopters and boats from  to assist in the relief operation us president  allocated a  10million  62million in 2017  grant to provide food and other essential relief to the survivors of the storm and the u.s ambassador to pakistan pledged that he would  assist the east pakistan government in every way feasible  the american government also sent a number of blankets tents and other supplies six helicopters two helicopters at an aid mission in  and four from the united states were sent to east pakistan some 200,000tons of wheat were shipped from the united states to the stricken region by the end of november there were 38 helicopters operating in the disaster area ten of which were british and ten american the americans had provided about 50 small boats and the british 70 for supply distribution  halted aid shipments to the country the week after the cyclone hit because of unwillingness to let the pakistani government handle distribution however by january they had reached an agreement to construct 24,000 cement brick houses at a cost of about  1.2million  7million in 2017  american concerns about delays by the pakistani government in determining how the relief should be used meant that  7.5million  46million in 2017  of relief granted by the  had not been handed over in march much of the money was earmarked to be spent on constructing cyclone shelters and rebuilding housing the american  offered to send volunteers but were rebuffed by the pakistani government a   centred on  and  left singapore for the bay of bengal to assist with the relief efforts they carried eight helicopters and eight landing craft as well as rescue teams and supplies fifty soldiers and two helicopters were flown in ahead of the ships to survey the disaster area and bring relief work the british task force arrived off the pakistan coast on november 24 and the 650 troops aboard the ships immediately began using  to deliver supplies to offshore islands an appeal by the british  raised about 1.5million  21million in 2017  for disaster relief in east pakistan the canadian government pledged  2million of assistance france and  both sent helicopters and various supplies worth  1.3million  announced that he would visit dhaka during a visit to the far east and urged people to pray for the victims of the disaster the vatican later contributed  100,000 to the relief efforts by the start of 1971 four soviet helicopters were still operating in the region transporting essential supplies to hard-hit areas the soviet aircraft which had drawn criticism from  replaced the british and american helicopters that had operated immediately after the cyclone the government of singapore sent a military medical mission to east pakistan which arrived at chittagong on december 1 1971 they were then deployed to  where they treated nearly 27,000people and carried out a  vaccination effort the mission returned to singapore on december 22 after bringing about  50,000 worth of medical supplies and 15 tons of food for the victims of the storm the japanese cabinet approved a total of  1.65million of relief funds in december the japanese government had previously drawn criticism for only donating a small amount to relief work the first shipment of chinese supplies to east pakistan was a planeload of 500,000 doses of cholera vaccine which was not necessary as the country had adequate stocks the chinese government sent  1.2million in cash to pakistan  declared that the disaster was also an iranian one and responded by sending two planeloads of supplies within a few days of the cyclone striking many smaller poorer asian nations sent nominal amounts of aid the united nations donated  2.1million in food and cash whilst  began a drive to raise a further million unicef helped to re-establish water supplies in the wake of the storm repairing over 11,000 wells in the months

in 1971 ex  was inspired to organize  in part from the 1970 bhola cyclone and from the  and  although it was the first  of its type it was extremely successful in raising money aid and awareness for the region s plight after the impact 
in december the league of red cross societies drafted a plan for immediate use should a comparable event to the cyclone hit other  disaster prone countries  a red cross official stated some of the relief workers sent to east pakistan were poorly trained and the organisation would compile a list of specialists the un general assembly adopted a proposal to improve its ability to provide aid to disaster-stricken countries in 1966 the  had begun to support the development of a cyclone warning system which developed into a cyclone preparedness programme in 1972 today run by the  and the  the programme s objectives are to raise public awareness of the risks of cyclones and to provide training to emergency personnel in the coastal regions of bangladesh in the 30years after the 1970 cyclone over 200 cyclone shelters were constructed in the coastal regions of bangladesh when the  approached the country in 1991 volunteers from the cyclone preparedness programme warned people of the cyclone two to three days before it struck land over 350,000people fled their homes to shelters and other brick structures whilst others sought high ground while the 1991 cyclone killed over 138,000people this was significantly less than the 1970 storm partly because of the warnings sent out by the cyclone preparedness programme however the 1991 storm was significantly more destructive causing 1.5billion dollars in damage  2billion inflation-adjusted  compared to the 1970 storm s 86.4million dollars in damage see also
