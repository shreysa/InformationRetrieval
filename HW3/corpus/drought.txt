a drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply whether atmospheric  or  a drought can last for months or years or may be declared after as few as 15 days it can have a substantial impact on the  and  of the affected region and harm to the local  annual dry seasons in the  significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of  many plant species such as those in the family cactaceae  or   have  adaptations like reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought some others survive dry periods as buried seeds semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands prolonged droughts have caused  and humanitarian crises most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity the most prolonged drought ever in the world in  occurred in the  in   400 years

mechanisms of producing precipitation include   and  rainfall convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation over a longer duration precipitation can be divided into three categories based on whether it falls as liquid water liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface or ice droughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are in themselves low if these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficient to reach the surface over a sufficient time the result is a drought drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high   carrying continental rather than oceanic air masses and ridges of  aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region once a region is within drought feedback mechanisms such as local arid air hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions dry season

human activity can directly trigger exacerbating factors such as over farming excessive   and  adversely impact the ability of the land to capture and hold water in arid climates the main source of erosion is wind erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind the wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region  deflation  suspended particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion  ecological succession  wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation

as a drought persists the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases people tend to define droughts in three main ways  

 drought is brought about when there is a prolonged time with less than average precipitation meteorological drought usually precedes the other kinds of drought  droughts affect crop production or the ecology of the  this condition can also arise independently from any change in precipitation levels when  conditions and erosion triggered by poorly planned agricultural endeavors cause a shortfall in water available to the crops however in a traditional drought it is caused by an extended period of below average precipitation  drought is brought about when the water reserves available in sources such as   and  fall below the   hydrological drought tends to show up more slowly because it involves stored water that is used but not replenished like an agricultural drought this can be triggered by more than just a loss of rainfall for instance  was recently  awarded a large amount of money by the  to restore water that had been diverted to other nations from the  under  rule similar circumstances also place their largest lake  at risk of completely drying out 
consequences of drought 




a  dead due to drought 

the effects of droughts and water shortages can be divided into three groups  environmental economic and social consequences in the case of environmental effects  lower surface and subterranean water levels lower flow levels  with a decrease below the minimum leading to direct danger for amphibian life  increased pollution of surface water the drying out of wetlands more and larger fires higher deflation intensity losing biodiversity worse health of trees and the appearance of pests and den droid diseases economic losses include lower agricultural forests game and fishing output higher food production costs lower energy production levels in hydro plants losses caused by depleted water tourism and transport revenue problems with water supply for the energy sector and technological processes in metallurgy mining the chemical paper wood foodstuff industries etc disruption of water supplies for municipal economies meanwhile social costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon  excessive heat waves  possible limitation of water supplies and its increased pollution levels high food costs stress caused by failed harvests etc this is why droughts and fresh water shortages may be considered as a factor which increases the gap between developed and developing countries the effect varies according to vulnerability for example subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food sources areas with populations that depend on water sources as a major food source are more vulnerable to famine drought can also reduce water quality because lower water flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase  of remaining water sources common consequences of drought include
