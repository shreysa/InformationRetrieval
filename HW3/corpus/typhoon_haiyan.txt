the contributions of the united states was in contrast to that of china it gave the philippines an amount of us 51.9 million worth of aid apart and deployed the   and  in order to assist with the humanitarian operations this was seen by observers as part of the asia pivot that the united states government had previously announced the philippine government had been discussing with the u.s plans regarding the deployment of u.s military troops within the country aid contributions of the u.s was seen as a sign of goodwill in order to further strengthen relations vietnam
