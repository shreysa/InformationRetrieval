the hurricane accelerated westward into an area of highly favorable conditions and began to rapidly intensify late on august 22  in a 24hour period the atmospheric pressure dropped by 47mbar  1.388inhg  to a minimum of 922mbar  27.23inhg  on august 23 the storm attained category 5 status on the  reaching  of 175 mph  280 km h  a short distance off  island in the bahamas at 18 00 utc despite its intensity andrew was a small tropical cyclone with winds of 35mph  56km h  extending out only about 90 mi  150 km  from the center after reaching that intensity the hurricane underwent an  at 21 00 utc on august 23 andrew made landfall on eleuthera with winds of 160mph  260km h  the cyclone weakened further while crossing the  and at 01 00 utc on august 24 andrew hit the southern  of the bahamas with winds of 150mph  240km h  as it crossed over the warm waters of the  the hurricane rapidly re-intensified as the eye decreased in size and its eyewall convection deepened at 08 40 utc on august 24 andrew struck  with winds of 165mph  266km h  and a pressure of 926mbar  27.34inhg  about 25minutes after its first florida landfall andrew hit just northeast of homestead with a slightly lower pressure of 922mbar  27.23inhg  this barometric pressure made andrew the most intense hurricane to strike the united states since  in  and the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in florida since the  of  
as the eye moved onshore in florida the convection in the eyewall strengthened due to increased convergence and hurricane hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior however andrew weakened as it continued further inland and after crossing southern florida in four hours the storm emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 130 mph  210 km h  in the gulf of mexico the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north andrew steadily re-intensified over the gulf of mexico reaching winds of 145 mph  235 km h  late on august 25 as the high pressure system to its north weakened a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest this caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest and winds decreased as andrew approached the  at 08 30 utc on august 26 the cyclone made landfall about 20 mi  30 km  west-southwest of morgan city louisiana with winds of 115mph  185km h  andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast falling to tropical storm intensity within 10 hours after entering mississippi the cyclone deteriorated to tropical depression status early on august 27 accelerating northeastward the depression began merging with the approaching frontal system and by midday on august 28 andrew merged with a  while located over the southern appalachian mountains the remnants continued moving towards the northeast and it lost its identity later that day merging with the remnants of  and a frontal zone over the  post-analysis on andrew revealed that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on august 22 and early on august 26 in real time the  assessed its peak intensity as 150mph  240km h  which was upgraded to 155 mph  250 km h  in a post-storm analysis after the season ended however a 2004 paper by  and others concluded that andrew became a category 5 hurricane near the bahamas on august 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175 mph  280 km h  the paper also indicated that andrew briefly re-intensified into a category 5 hurricane around the time of landfall in south florida early on august 24 the storm was found to have been slightly stronger while approaching louisiana but the landfall winds were decreased from 120 mph  195 km h  to 115 mph  185 km h  preparations

although proposals to rebuild homestead air force base were initially rejected the  eventually expended over  100million to begin repairs unsalvageable buildings were demolished reconstruction then began on a  tower air traffic control tower and maintenance hangars next the rebuilding of communications medical security facility vehicle maintenance and wing headquarters buildings began on march5 1994 the base reopened as homestead air reserve base prior to andrew the base employed approximately 6,500military personnel and 1,000civilians and annually added about  450million to the local economy after its reopening  bobby d angelo expected the base to annually contribute less than half of that  between  180million and  200million the city of homestead spent about  6million on rebuilding the  despite this the  fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans moved their  location to  in  as homes were being rebuilt fema provided free temporary mobile homes for 3,501families and financial assistance to more than 40,000other families for staying in hotel rooms paying rent and repairing homes nearly two years after andrew about 70 of homes in homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt additionally of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout dade county 36,000had been restored by july 1994 more than 930,000policyholders in south florida lost coverage after 11insurance companies went bankrupt caused by more than 600,000insurance claims filed this led the florida legislature to create new entities such as the joint underwriting association the florida windstorm underwriting association and the florida hurricane catastrophe fund in an effort to restore adequate insurance capacity stricter building codes were created in florida in the aftermath of hurricane andrew a survey by tim marshall and richard herzog of the haag engineer company in  highlighted several construction issues on the roof of some homes the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper which could easily be ripped by straight line winds at houses with shingled roofs it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis also allowing them to be torn away after the tiles or shingles were peeled off the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather eventually the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure leading to roof collapses 



tent cities were constructed to house displaced residents 

in july1996 governor chiles established the florida building codes study commission with the purpose of assessing the building codes at the time as well as enacting improvements and reform to the system the commission study indicated that building codes and regulations were developed amended and administered by over 400local jurisdictions and state agencies the florida building code was established in 1998 and put into effect by 2002 it phased out local laws and regulations and replaced them with universal statewide building codes after hurricanes    and  in  a study conducted by the  in the following year noted that  homes built under the new florida building code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001  a report by the florida legislature in 2006 after hurricanes   and  in  came to a similar conclusion indicating that  they added further evidence that the florida building code is working 
the hurricane also transformed the demographics of dade county a migration of mostly white families northward to broward and palm beach county was ongoing but accelerated after andrew many of these families had used the money they received from insurance claims to relocate the population growth was especially noticeable in southwestern broward county where land development was pushed  years ahead of schedule  similar migration occurred within the jewish community although there are areas of dade county that still have significant jewish populations many jews resettled to  west    and  in broward county and  and  in palm beach county the county had a net loss of about 36,000people in 1992 while broward and palm beach counties gained about 17,000 and 2,300dade county residents respectively by 2001 230,710people had moved from dade county to broward county while 29,125dade county residents had moved to palm beach county however as broward county became more crowded 100,871people relocated from broward county to palm beach county consequently the hispanic population in south dade county climbed rapidly in homestead for example the latino population increased from 30 to 45 between 1990 and 2000 during the storm a facility housing  was destroyed allowing many of them to escape into the everglades although burmese pythons  native to   had been sighted in everglades national park since the 1980s the destruction of this facility contributed significantly to  due to rapid reproduction and ability to prey on many species the population of burmese pythons exploded with possibly as many as 300,000 in the everglades alone efforts have been made to curb the thriving population of these  snakes including a ban on importation of the species to the united states since january2012 and increased regulations on ownership of a boa constrictor or python louisiana 
on august 26 george h w bush toured devastated areas of louisiana with   president bush remarked  the destruction from this storm goes beyond anything we have known in recent years  but noted that damage was less severe than in florida after his visit to louisiana president bush declared only  as a disaster area but later included  under this declaration fema initially opened five field offices throughout louisiana these centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid after franklin mayor sam jones and congressman  criticized fema for failing to open a field office in franklin fema promised to do so in the first few days following the storm  members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees roofing shingles and torn aluminum siding the state national guard also dispatched water purification units and tanks with filled potable water about 1,300national guardsmen were deployed to southern louisiana in early september officials announced that 1,400mobile homes homes and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable house resolution 5620 also included disaster aid to the state of louisiana in early december the   sba  approved  33.2million worth of low-interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses by then fema had received about 43,600 applications for aid while approving  35.9million in grants to over 18,000 households that were ineligible for loans from the sba or were uninsured in addition to the mobile homes already provided fema spent  22.6 million on disaster housing
