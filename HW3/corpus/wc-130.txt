in 1954 the air weather service  aws  replaced its  as its primary weather reconnaissance platform with a fleet of wb-50ds deployed in seven squadrons between 1956 and 1960 six wb-50 accidents resulted in the loss of an entire crew and caused the deaths of 66 crew members  metal fatigue and other structural problems with the type was to end its service by 1965 the c-130 hercules was desired by the aws as the best alternative but budgetary limitations prevented the procurement of new aircraft for the mission  had always considered aerial weather reconnaissance an expendable luxury when budget cuts were necessary or when funds were needed for expensive programs in 1958 its desire to field a large  deterrent force resulted in the shutdown of two aws squadrons followed by three more in march 1960 the problems with the wb-50 brought to a head in may 1960 by fuel leaks that grounded the entire 66-plane fleet accelerated the process which scheduled a complete phaseout by 1963 aws fought against the decision however and the proposed permanent shutdown of aws s flying mission alarmed high-level operational commanders worldwide including the admiral commanding the  the commander of the  general  recommended that the wb-50s be replaced by b-47s that were being phased out by sac and when gen  gave his support for the proposal modification of 34 wb-47es in 1963 for the aws was approved and the re-activation of three discontinued weather recon squadrons scheduled for 1962 in the meantime a bilateral moratorium with the soviet union on the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons was starting its third year when a suggestion was made that the classified air sampling program monitoring the moratorium and being conducted by at least five usaf commands be consolidated under a single manager and agency aws lobbied for the mission and submitted a plan in february 1961 naming itself the single manager lemay now  approved the plan on 31 august 1961  the next day the soviet union resumed nuclear testing headquarters air force authorized the acquisition of five new c-130bs factory-configured for the sampling mission to be delivered in april 1962 when aws would become the air sampling single-manager these became the first weather-mission c-130 aircraft after the five c-130bs became operational with aws conversions of six c-130es followed in 1965 but as weather platforms a dropsonde system was installed in all the c-130bs and the designation of all c-130 weather variants was permanently changed to  wc-130  on 25 august 1965 three wc-130as were created in southeast asia in 1967 and 11 more wc-130bs were added in 1970 to replace the wb-47s which had been abruptly retired from service in september 1969 the first of 15 wc-130hs was converted in 1973 from rescue command and control aircraft  that had themselves been modified from c-130es  service life of some of these variants over-lapped as they operated with the 53rd   and  thee andh models have had the greatest longevity in service 28 and 32 years respectively of the seven original weather reconnaissance squadrons four of which received the wc-130 at some point only the 53d wrs remains active now assigned to the   afrc  the wc-130j model introduced in 1999 is currently the weather reconnaissance platform for the 53rd wrs part of the  of the  at  mississippi many of the wc-130s replaced in the weather reconnaissance mission were subsequently redistributed after de-modification to other afrc and  wings for use again in their original tactical airlift role or as training aircraft while others were sold to foreign air forces mission 
the wc-130 provides vital tropical cyclone forecasting information and is the primary weather data collector for the  supplemented by the  s  they penetrate tropical cyclones and hurricanes at altitudes ranging from 500 to 10,000 feet  150 to 3,050m  above the ocean surface depending upon the intensity of the storm the most important function of these reconnaissance aircraft is to collect high-density high-accuracy weather data from within the storm s environment this includes penetration of the center or hurricane eye of the storm this vital information is instantly relayed by satellite to the national hurricane center to aid in the accurate forecasting of hurricane movement and intensity variants and operational history 
the lockheed c-130 has been operated as a weather reconnaissance aircraft in the following sub-types 
wc-130b  19621973 
five new c-130bs factory-configured for air sampling were delivered to the  at  california in 1962 after operational testing and evaluation three were distributed to the 54th 56th and 57th wrs and the 55th deployed one of its remaining two to  alaska in 1965 all had  systems installed at the   wrama  and were transferred to the 53rd wrs at  puerto rico for use in the hurricane hunter mission the first of thousands of such missions for the just-designated wc-130 was flown on 27 august 1965 into the eye of  the most destructive hurricane in recorded history to that time in the aftermath of  in august 1969 and the simultaneous shutdown of the wb-47 program funds were appropriated to fund project seek cloud an upgrade of tropical storm reconnaissance capability by an increase in c-130 platforms and an upgrade in meteorological equipment 12 additional c-130b transports were obtained from  and modified in 19701971 with the new equipment suite one was soon transferred to noaa but the other 11 went into military service three to the 54th to replace the wc-130as and the rest to the 53rd which had transferred four of its five original b-models to other squadrons after receiving seek cloud retrofits efforts to develop forward-looking and side-looking weather radars were unsuccessful the second batch of c-130bs were in service only a few years before all were de-modified and turned over to the reserve forces the wc-130bs were powered by four   engines rated at 4,050 horsepower had a cruising speed of 350 ktas a radius of action of 1,200 miles with a payload of 25,000 lb and a service ceiling of 30,000 feet wc-130e  19651993 
in 1965 the air force procured six e-model variants to replace six  in the  at   three veteran airlifters were transferred from the   tac  and three obtained new all were modified with the amt-1 dropsonde system and assigned to the 54th wrs where they remained until 1972 from then to 1987 when they were assigned permanently to the 53d wrs the e-models were assigned to the operational demands of all the operational weather reconnaissance squadrons in 1989 they were upgraded with the improved weather reconnaissance system  i-wars  utilizing the  previously installed in wc-130h model and remained in regular operational service until retired in 1993 wc-130a  19671970 
three c-130a transports were obtained from tac in 1966 during the  to conduct  a rain-making operation in southeast asia in early 1967 they were modified for an additional weather reconnaissance mission by installation of the amt-1 dropsonde system two were based for the dual missions on a rotational basis at   with a third at anderson afb for maintenance and crew changes missions were flown by crews of the 54th wrs and included  to all areas of sea all three reverted to c-130a standard in 1971 after their replacement by upgraded models wc-130h  19732005 




wc-130h hercules in flight


with the drawdown of u.s participation in the war in southeast asia a number of extended-range  assigned to the   a sister agency of the air weather service in the   became excess because of budgetary reductions with hurricane camille still fresh in the minds of congress and the american public and retention of the aws flying mission still strong in mac headquarters aws proposed to headquarters air force in march 1972 that its 16 wc-130bs be replaced by a like number of the available hc-130hs the request was approved in december 1972 but altered a month later aws was ordered to retain three of the bs and could give up the other 13 in return for 11 hc-130hs  4.5 million was budgeted for wrama to transfer the seek cloud equipment from the bs to the newer hs and the changeover occurred between june 1973 and july 1974 four additional hc-130hs were converted in 1975 a total of 15 hc-130h rescue hercules were eventually modified with seek cloud equipment and designated wc-130h replacing all 16 wc-130bs in the weather reconnaissance squadrons the wc-130h was equipped with the more powerful  rated at 4,910 horsepower and had wing-mounted fuel tanks that provided an additional 2,720gallons  10,300l  of fuel extending the wc-130h s radius of action at maximum cruise speed  230 kias 350 ktas  to 2,250nautical miles a contract was awarded  on 29 september 1987 to build and install 20 iwrs suites but two days later the 54th wrs was inactivated leaving only ten wc-130s in service seven with the 53d wrs and three in the air force reserve even so the iwrs system went operational in the wc-130h in 1988 and remains standard equipment manned weather reconnaissance continued to be reduced when aws finally divested itself of its flying mission in 1991 by inactivating the 53d wrs and transferring both the mission and its few remaining aircraft assets to the   afrc  but the devastation wrought by  in 1992 again demonstrated the need for  hurricane hunting  and state-of-the-art equipment to accomplish it and the 53d was resurrected as a full-time unit of afrc in 1993 the wc-130s were transferred back to it but the h-models were showing their age and between 1999 and 2005 all were replaced by the new technologically-advanced j-variant wc-130j  1999present
