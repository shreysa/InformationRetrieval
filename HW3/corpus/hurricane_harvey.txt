the floodwaters contain a number of hazards to the environment and human health the houston health department stated that  millions of contaminants  were present in floodwaters these include  and  bacteria  measurements of  showed the concentrations were so high that there were risks of contracting  from the water houston officials stated that the houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact  however  hundreds of thousands of people across the 38 texas counties affected by hurricane harvey use private wells according to an estimate by  researchers and those people must fend for themselves  additionally  which includes houston contains a large number ofdesigned  sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens two superfund sites in corpus christi were flooded environmental factors 
the  places it in a low-lying part of the  and itsbased soils provide poor drainage the  brings very heavy rainfall which together with tidal flood events means that there have been repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836 though the flood control district founded in 1947 aided by the  managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years more recently residents died in  historic flooding  in  and in the  there is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region and drop huge amounts of rain over an extended period as occurred during  in 1979 and  in 2001 the area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea the main waterways the  and the  meander slowly laden with mud and have little capacity for carrying storm water urban development 
houston has seen rapid urban development   with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels between 1992 and 2010 almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons however harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area the katy prairie in western harris county which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to  and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in harris county since 2010 subsidence 
extraction of oil and groundwater from underground  leaves unsupported voids resulting in ground collapse a process called  houston itself is in a very large subsidence bowl with smaller bowls within that area showing greater subsidence  in some cases as much as 9 feet  2.7m  these result in drainage systems no longer having the required gradient to operate efficiently so storm water drains more slowly the coastline near houston has seen sea level increasing by 6 inches  15cm  in recent decades due to subsidence combined with the  climate change

the  is known for hurricanes in august so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to  but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall weather events are due to multiple factors and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition but climate change affects aspects of extreme events and very likely worsened some of the impacts of harvey in a briefing the  stated that the quantity of rainfall from harvey had very likely been increased by climate change the relationship between climate change and the frequency of hurricanes  or tropical cyclones  is still unclear and is the subject of continuing research harvey approached houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger more intense and longer lasting in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall  added to the resulting problems according to officials from the harris county flood control district harvey caused the third  500-year  flood in three years  the  states 

the recent increases in activity are linked in part to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that atlantic hurricanes form in and move through numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures including natural variability human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases and particulate pollution quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research 
warmer air can hold more water vapour in accordance with the  and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records regional  around houston have risen around 0.5c  0.9f  in recent decades which caused a 35 increase in moisture in the atmosphere this had the effect of allowing harvey to strengthen more than expected the water temperature of the gulf of mexico was above average for this time of the year and likely to be a factor in harvey s impact within a week of harvey  formed due to the same unusually warm sea-water some scientists fear this may be becoming a  new normal  also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating the slow movement of harvey over texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state as has also happened with earlier storms harvey s stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the us at the time which had pushed the jet stream to the north research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate change see also

other tropical cyclones that made landfall in the same region of the texas gulf coast
