brazil current in a map of the atlantic ocean


the brazil current is a warm water current that flows south along the  south coast to the mouth of the  description 
this current is caused by diversion of a portion of the   from where that current meets the  continent the brazil current begins at about 10-15s where the south equatorial current  sec  splits near cabo de sao roque brazil the current reaches a depth of 700m and the estimated transport at 12s is 2.5 sv the transport increases as the current goes further south with 4 sv at 15s on the offshore side of the current an anticyclonic recirculation  at about 30s causes an increase of the brazil currents transport the estimated southward transport at 27s 31s 34s and 36s are 11 sv 17 sv 22 sv and 41 sv the total transport can be from 70-80 sv by 36s with half of it being in the recirculation gyre the brazil current is a part of the south atlantic subtropical gyre the southern side of the gyre consists of the eastward flowing south atlantic current  sac  the eastern boundary is the benguela current system  bcs  the north side consists of the sec which flows west and then splits with the north water becoming the north brazil current  nbc  the southern flowing waters become the brazil current which makes up the western boundary it is a  like the  and is indeed its southern counterpart  however it is considerably shallower and weaker it flows south from the equator to the west wind drift it joins the   malvinas current  at the   see   making it a temperate sea the brazil-falkland confluence is where the brazil current begins to separate from the coast at about 36s and is when the saltier subtropical water of the brazil current meets the fresher subantarctic water of the falkland current the main transport of the current leaves the continental shelf at about 38s and the sea surface temperature at this latitude is estimated to be about 16-18c although the latitude where the current separates from the coast has been thought to be farther north from july to september than from january to march if the falkland current has low transport then the path of the brazil current is dominated by wind stress curl however if the falkland current transport is increased then the brazil current separates from the coast at the observed 38s latitude the range of sea surface temperature and the salinity for the brazil-falkland confluence is 7-18c and 33.6-36 psu the brazil current region also contains six major water masses within the system  upper circumpolar water  ucpw  lower circumpolar water  lcpw  central water  cw  antarctic intermediate water  aaiw  antarctic bottom water  aabw  and north atlantic deep water  nadw  references
