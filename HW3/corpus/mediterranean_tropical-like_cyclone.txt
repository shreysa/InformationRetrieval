factors required for the formation of medicanes are somewhat different than that normally expected of   known to emerge over regions with  below 26c  79f  mediterranean tropical cyclones often require incursions of colder air to induce atmospheric instability a majority of medicanes develop above regions of the mediterranean with ssts of 15 to 26c  59 to 79f  with the upper bound only found in the southernmost reaches of the sea despite the low sea surface temperatures the instability incited by cold atmospheric air within a  zoneregions with high differences in temperature and pressurepermits the formation of medicanes in contrast to tropical areas lacking high baroclinity where raised ssts are needed while significant deviations in air temperature have been noted around the time of mediterranean tropical cyclones  formation few anomalies in sea surface temperature coincide with their development indicating that the formation of medicanes is primarily controlled by higher air temperatures not by anomalous ssts similar to tropical cyclones minimal difference in wind speed and direction over a regionas well as abundant moisture and vorticity encourages the genesis of tropical cyclone-like systems in the mediterranean sea due to the confined character of the mediterranean and the limited capability of in the case of medicanes airsea heat transfertropical cyclones with a diameter larger than 300km  190mi  cannot exist within the mediterranean despite being a relatively baroclinic area with high temperature gradients the primary energy source utilized by mediterranean tropical cyclones is derived from underlying heat sources generated by the presence of convectionthunderstorm activityin a humid environment similar to tropical cyclones elsewhere outside the mediterranean sea in comparison to other  the mediterranean sea generally presents a difficult environment for development  although the potential energy necessary for development is not abnormally large its atmosphere is characterized by its lack of moisture impeding potential formation the full development of a medicane often necessitates the formation of a large-scale baroclinic disturbance transitioning late in its life cycle into a tropical cyclone-like system nearly always under the influence of a deep cut-off  within the middle-to-upper  frequently resulting from abnormalities in a wide-spreading massive  of upper-atmospheric winds 



a weak and disorganized mediterranean tropical cyclone on 28 january 2010


the development of medicanes often results from the vertical shift of air in the troposphere as well resulting in a decrease in its temperature coinciding with an increase in relative humidity creating an environment more conducive for tropical cyclone formation this in turn leads to in an increase in potential energy producing heat-induced air-sea instability moist air prevents the occurrence of convective the vertically downward movement of airwhich often hinder the inception of tropical cyclones and in such a scenario wind shear remains minimal  overall cold-core cut-off lows serve well for the later formation of compactinfluenced warm-core lows such as medicanes the regular genesis of cold-core upper-level lows and the infrequency of mediterranean tropical cyclones however indicate that additional unusual circumstances are involved the emergence of the latter elevated sea surface temperatures contrasting with cold atmospheric air encourage atmospheric instability especially within the troposphere in general most medicanes maintain a radius of 70 to 200km  40 to 120mi  last between 12hours and 5days travel between 700 to 3,000km  430 to 1,860mi  develop an eye for less than 72hours and feature wind speeds of up to 144km h  89mph  in addition a majority are characterized on  as asymmetric systems with a distinct round  encircled by  weak rotation similar to that in most tropical cyclones is usually noted in a medicane s early stages increasing with intensity  medicanes however often have less time to intensify remaining weaker than most  and only persisting for the duration of a few days the maximum achievable intensity of medicanes is equivalent to the lowest classification on the  category1 while the entire lifetime of a cyclone may encompass several days most will only retain tropical characteristics for less than 24hours circumstances sometimes permit the formation of smaller-scale medicanes although the required conditions differ even from those needed by other medicanes the development of abnormally small tropical cyclones in the mediterranean usually requires upper-level atmospheric cyclones inducing cyclogenesis in the lower atmosphere leading to the formation of warm-core lows encouraged by favorable moisture heat and other environmental circumstances mediterranean cyclones have been compared to cyclonic storms which typically develop in the far regions of the northern and southern hemispheresfor their similarly small size and heat-related instability  however while medicanes nearly always feature warm-core lows polar lows are primarily cold-core the prolonged life of medicanes and similarity to polar lows is caused primarily by origins as synoptic-scale surface lows and heat-related instability heavy precipitation and convection within a developing mediterranean tropical cyclone are usually incited by the approach of an upper-level an elongated area of low air pressuresbringing downstream cold air encircling an existing low-pressure system after this occurs however a considerable reduction in rainfall rates occurs despite further organization coinciding with a decrease in previously high lightning activity as well although troughs will often accompany medicanes along their track separation eventually occurs usually in the later part of a mediterranean tropical cyclone s life cycle at the same time moist air saturated and cooled while rising into the atmosphere then encounters the medicane and permits further development and evolution into a tropical cyclone many of these characteristics are also evident in polar lows notable storms and impacts

the last major mediterranean tropical cyclone of 1996 while west of italy on 7october


three notable medicanes developed in 1996 the first in mid-september1996 was a typical mediterranean tropical cyclone that developed in the  region at the time of the cyclone s formation a powerful atlantic  and a  associated with a large-scale low producing northeasterly winds over the iberian peninsula extended eastward into the mediterranean while abundant moisture gathered in the lower troposphere over the balearic channel on the morning of 12september a disturbance developed off of  dropping heavy rainfall on the coast even without coming ashore an eye developed shortly thereafter as the system rapidly traversed across  and  in its eastward trek it made  upon the coast of southern italy on the evening of 13september with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 990mbar  29.24inhg  dissipating shortly after coming ashore with a diameter of about 150km  93mi  at valencia and other regions of eastern spain the storm generated heavy precipitation while six tornadoes touched down over the balearic islands while approaching the coast of the balearic islands the warm-core low induced a pressure drop of 11mbar  0.32inhg  at  in advance of the tropical cyclone s landfall medicanes as small as the one that formed in september1996 are atypical and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular mediterranean tropical cyclone formation warm low-level transfer of heat through air or seacaused by a large-scale low over the western mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection the presence of a mid to upper-level cut-off  a method of formation typical to medicanes was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone in addition interaction between a northeastward-drifting  the medicane and the large-scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfall the second of the three recorded mediterranean tropical cyclones in 1996 formed between sicily and  on 4october making landfall on both sicily and southern italy the medicane generated major flooding in sicily  meanwhile in  wind gusts of up to 108km h  67mph  were reported in addition to severe inundation the third major mediterranean tropical cyclone of that year formed north of  and strengthened while sweeping between the balearic islands and sardinia with anlike feature prominent on satellite the eye was distorted and disappeared after transiting over southern sardinia throughout the evening of 8october with the system weakening as a whole on the morning of october9 a smaller eye emerged as the system passed over the  gradually strengthening with reports 100km  62mi  from the storm s center reporting winds of 90km h  56mph  extreme damage was reported in the  after the tropical cyclone passed north of sicily though the system dissipated while turning southward over calabria overall the lowest estimated atmospheric pressure in the third medicane was 998mbar  29.47inhg  both october systems featured distinctive spiral bands intense convection high sustained winds and abundant precipitation september 2006 




the mediterranean tropical cyclone of 26 september 2006


a short-lived medicane developed near the end of september2006 along the coast of italy the origins of the medicane can be traced to the alpine  on the evening of 25september likely forming as a normal lee cyclone at 0600 on 26september  model analyses indicated the existence of two  along the shoreline of italy one on the west coast sweeping eastward across the  while the other slightly more intense low was located over the  as the latter low approached the  it met an eastward-moving convection-producing  resulting in significant intensification while the system simultaneously reduced in size it then achieved a minimum  of approximately 986  29.12  after transiting north-northeastward across the 40km  25miwide  in the course of roughly 30minutes at 0915utc the same day wind gusts surpassing 144km h  89mph  were recorded as it passed over salento due to a steep  associated with it confirmed by regional  denoting the presence of a clear  the high winds inflicted moderate damages throughout the peninsula though specific damage is unknown around 1000utc both radar and satellite recorded the system s entry into the  and its gradual northwestward curve back toward the italian coast by 1700utc the cyclone made  in northern  while maintaining its intensity with a minimum atmospheric pressure at 988mbar  29.18inhg  the cyclone weakened while drifting further inland over the italian mainland eventually dissipating as it curved west-southwestward a later study in 2008 evaluated that the cyclone possessed numerous characteristics seen in tropical cyclones elsewhere with a spiral appearance eye-like apparatus rapid atmospheric pressure decreases in advance of landfall and intense sustained winds concentrated near the storm s eyewall  the apparent eye-like structure in the cyclone however was ill-defined since then the medicane has been the subject of significant study as a result of the availability of scientific observations and reports related to the cyclone in particular the sensitivity of this cyclone to sea-surface temperatures initial conditions the model and the parameterization schemes used in the simulations were analyzed the relevance of different instability indices for the diagnosis and the prediction of these events were also studied november 2011  rolf 01m
