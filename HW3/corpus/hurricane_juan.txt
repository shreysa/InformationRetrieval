hurricane juan remained at peak intensity for over 24hours after moving northwestward for an extended period of time it turned and accelerated to the north the eye became less distinct on september28 and the hurricane weakened slightly due to its fast forward motion juan had little time to weaken over significantly colder waters before making  between  and   near halifax  on september29 with winds of 100mph  160km h  it weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern  and crossing the  as a hurricane juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over  by early september29 later that afternoon the storm was absorbed by a large  over the northwestern  preparations 
the first advisories were issued by the  on september26 although at that time they broadly suggested the possibility existed for wind and rain across  as juan approached on september27 warning broadcasts on local media in atlantic canada were changed accordingly the public and  in the expected landfall area were told to make preparations for a potential disaster after the chc bulletins indicated the possibility existed for significant wind damage and flooding from both heavy rain and  as well as power outages on the morning of september28 reports indicated that juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal category1 hurricane weather broadcasts up to that time gave every indication that the storm would weaken prior to landfall by 6 p.m   2100   additional warnings had been issued since juan was expected to make landfall as a strong category1 or weak category2 hurricane most businesses in the areas affected were  which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute although no large-scale  were made local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of september 28 in all several hundred people were affected by these evacuations  workers also stood on standby before the storm hit preparing for large-scale power outages impact
