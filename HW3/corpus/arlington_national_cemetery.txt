inurnment criteria for columbarium 
due at least partly to the lack of space at the cemetery for ground burial standards for inurnment  burial of cremated remains  in the columbarium are currently much less restrictive than for ground burial at the cemetery in general any former member of the armed forces who served on active duty  other than for training  and whose last service terminated honorably is eligible for inurnment eligibility for inurnment is described fully in  prohibitions against interment or memorialization 
congress has from time to time created prohibited categories of persons that even if otherwise eligible for burial lose that eligibility one such prohibition is against certain persons who are convicted of committing certain state or federal capital crimes as defined in  capital crime is a specifically defined term in the statute and for state offenses can include offenses that are eligible for a life sentence  with or without parole  the reasoning for this provision originally was to prevent  from being eligible at arlington national cemetery but it has since been amended to prevent others also prohibited under the same  are those determined with clear and convincing evidence to have avoided such conviction by death or flight notable burials
