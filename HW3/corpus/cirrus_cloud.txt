cirrus clouds merging to cirrocumulus clouds


cirrus cloud ranges in thickness from 100m  330ft  to 8,000m  26,000ft  with an average thickness of 1,500m  4,900ft  there are on average 30 per   96ice crystals per   but this ranges from one ice crystal per 10,000 liters  3.7ice crystals per 10,000 gallons  to 10,000 ice crystals per liter  37,000 ice crystals per gallon  a difference of eight  the length of each of these ice crystals is usually 0.25millimeters long but they range from as short as 0.01millimeters or as long as several millimeters the ice crystals in  are much smaller than those in naturally occurring cirrus cloud as they are around 0.001millimeters to 0.1millimeters in length cirrus can vary in temperature from 20  4  to 30c  22f  the ice crystals in cirrus clouds have different shapes in addition to different sizes some shapes include solid columns hollow columns plates rosettes and conglomerations of the various other types the shape of the ice crystals is determined by the air temperature atmospheric pressure and ice  cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type  the columns and plates tend to be at the top of the cloud whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base in the northern  region cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns plates and conglomerations and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size in  cirrus are usually composed of only the columns and these columns are much longer than normal 



fall streaks in a cirrus cloud


scientists have studied the characteristics of cirrus using several different methods one   lidar  gives highly accurate information on the cloud s altitude length and width balloon-carried  give information on the humidity of the cirrus cloud but are not accurate enough to measure the depth of the cloud radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds another data source is satellite measurements from the   sage  program these satellites measure where  is absorbed in the atmosphere and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes then it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location the united states  s  nasa    modis  also gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day during the night it determines cirrus cover by detecting the earth s infrared emissions the cloud reflects this radiation back to the ground thus enabling satellites to see the  shadow  it casts into space visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds 



cirrus fibratus clouds


based upon data taken from the united states using these methods cirrus cloud cover was found to vary  and seasonally the researchers found that in the summer at noon the cover is the lowest with an average of 23 of the united states  land area covered by cirrus around midnight the cloud cover increases to around 28 in winter the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night these percentages include clear days and nights as well as days and nights with other cloud types as lack of cirrus cloud cover when these clouds are present the typical coverage ranges from 30 to 50 based on satellite data cirrus covers an average of 20 to 25 of the earth s surface in the tropical regions this cloud covers around 70 of the region s surface area cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filamentssimilar to the  produced in liquidwater cloudscalled  and they are made of heavier ice crystals that fall from the cloud the sizes and shapes of fall streaks are determined by the  



the cirrus uncinus subform of cirrus clouds


cirrus comes in four distinct species  cirrus castellanus fibratus spissatus and uncinus  which are each divided into four varieties  intortus vertebratus radiatus and duplicatus cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body cirrus fibratus looks striated and is the most common cirrus species cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare s tails of the varieties cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape and cirrus radiatus has large radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky  are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear formation 
cirrus clouds are formed when water vapor undergoes deposition at high altitudes where the  ranges from 600 at 4,000m  13,000ft  above sea level to 200mbar at 12,000m  39,000ft  above sea level these conditions commonly occur at the leading edge of a  because humidity is low at such high altitudes this genus-type tends to be very thin.cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals that originate from the freezing of super cooled water droplets in regions where air temperature is lower than20c or30c.cirrus usually occur in fair weather.they are formed when it is high enough to be cold and freeze the water drops into ice they sometimes may be caused by turbulence and wind shear or by upper-tropospheric convection sometimes they are like blown out ice-crystals spreading from the top of a dying cumulonimbus cyclones

 are a manmade type of cirrus cloud formed when water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine condenses on particles which come from either the surrounding air or the exhaust itself and freezes leaving behind a visible trail the exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing  when there is an insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere one of the  is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in earth s atmosphere 
subforms
cirrus fibratus clouds appear as thin and fibrous looking noticeably they are the most common type of cirrus cloud they might indicate windy weather since they are mostly formed by  on higher altitudes cirrus uncinus clouds appear as thin and fibrous like except that they always have a hook or curl on the tip cirrus spissatus clouds are the highest clouds of the main cloud genera they may form in the higher  or even at the lower  they are dense and opaque not allowing the light of the sun or moon to pass through they are more common on the anvils of  clouds cirrus floccus is derived from  which means  lock of wool  or cirrus with ragged bases they are not to be confused with cirrocumulus floccus since they are larger than  and mostly are isolated a precipitation-based supplementary feature  is mostly visible which makes it easier to distinguish the difference between cirrocumulus floccus and cirrus floccus cirrus castellanus is derived from  which means  castle  or round turrets they indicate that  is occurring on the higher altitudes of the  they appear as tall clouds that originate from a flat base opacity-based varieties 
cirrus clouds are translucent and so have no opacity-based varieties  only one species is opaque which is cirrus spissatus pattern-based varieties 
cirrus intortus clouds is derived from  which means  twisted  or  wound  these clouds appear twisted or simply intorted cirrus vertebratus clouds resembling the appearance of bones as hinted by the word  vertebratus  they look more like fish bones with fibrous lines that originate from one which resembles the appearance of fish bones cirrus radiatus clouds appear as parallel lines that seem to originate from one point and can stretch for hundreds of miles and they move parallel to the wind shear use in forecasting

cirrus clouds cover up to 25 of the earth  up to 70 in the tropics  and have a net heating effect when they are thin and translucent the clouds efficiently absorb outgoing  radiation while only marginally reflecting the incoming sunlight when cirrus clouds are 100m  330ft  thick they reflect only around 9 of the incoming sunlight but they prevent almost 50 of the outgoing infrared radiation from escaping thus raising the temperature of the atmosphere beneath the clouds by an average of 10c  18f a process known as the  averaged worldwide cloud formation results in a temperature loss of 5c  9f  at the earth s surface mainly the result of  



cirrus fibratus clouds


as a result of their warming effects when relatively thin cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of  scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase thereby increasing temperatures and humidity this in turn would increase the cirrus cloud cover effectively creating a  circuit a prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth in addition the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud possibly causing the reflection of  and the reflection of the earth s infrared radiation to balance out a similar hypothesis put forth by  is the  in which an increase in tropical  results in less cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation emitted to space optical phenomena

cirrus clouds like  can produce several optical effects such as  around the sun and moon halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds which depending on their shape and orientation can result in a wide variety of white and colored rings arcs and spots in the sky common  varieties are the   the  and the   also known as fire rainbows  halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by  more rarely cirrus clouds are capable of producing  more commonly associated with liquid water-based clouds such as  a glory is a set of concentric faintly-colored glowing rings that appear around the shadow of the observer and are best observed from a high viewpoint or from a plane cirrus clouds only form glories when the constituent ice crystals are  and researchers suggest that the ice crystals must be between 0.009millimeters and 0.015millimeters in length

the heights of various cloud genera including high middle low and vertical


cirrus clouds are one of three different genera of high-tage  high-level  clouds high-tage clouds form at 5,000m  16,500ft  and above in temperate regions the other two genera  and cirrostratus are also high clouds in the intermediate range from 2,000m  6,500ft  to 7,000m  23,000ft  in temperate regions are the mid-tage clouds they comprise two or three genera depending on the system of height classification being used    and according to  classification  these clouds are formed from ice crystals supercooled water droplets or liquid water droplets low-tage clouds form at less than 2,000m  6,500ft  the two genera that are strictly low-tage are  and  these clouds are composed of water droplets except during winter when they are formed of  or ice crystals if the temperature at cloud level is below freezing two additional genera usually form in the low altitude range but may be based at higher levels under conditions of very low humidity they comprise the genera  and  which along with  are often classified separately as clouds of vertical development especially when their tops are high enough to be composed of super-cooled water droplets or ice crystals the altitudes of high-tage clouds like cirrus vary considerably with latitude in the polar regions they are at their lowest with a minimum altitude of only 3,000m  10,000ft  to a maximum of 7,600m  25,000ft  in tropical regions they are at their highest ranging in altitude from about 6,100m  20,000ft  to around 18,000m  60,000ft  in temperate regions they range in altitude from 5,000m  16,500ft  to 14,000m  45,000ft a variation in contrast to low-tage clouds which do not appreciably change altitude with latitude summary of high cloud genera 




a solar halo


there are three main genera in the family of high clouds  cirrus cirrocumulus and cirrostratus cirrostratus clouds commonly produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as   because of their frequent association with cirrus they are given the prefix  cirro  but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure cirrocumulus in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus and cirrostratus is stratiform like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds cirrocumulus 




a large field of cirrocumulus clouds


main article  
cirrocumulus clouds form in sheets or patches and do not cast shadows they commonly appear in regular rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between cirrocumulus are like other members of the cumuliform category formed via  processes significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather the ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders they are not solid but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends towards the top of the cloud these crystals have a tendency to clump together these clouds do not last long and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals they eventually begin to fall destroying the upward convection the cloud then dissipates into cirrus cirrocumulus clouds come in four species  stratiformis lenticularis castellanus and floccus they are  when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size cirrostratus 




a cirrostratus cloud


main article  
cirrostratus clouds can appear as a milky sheen in the sky or as a striated sheet they are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent cirrostratus come in two species fibratus and nebulosus the ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud towards the bottom at temperatures of around 35c  31f  to 45c  49f  the crystals tend to be long solid hexagonal columns towards the top of the cloud at temperatures of around 47c  53f  to 52c  62f  the predominant crystal types are thick hexagonal plates and short solid hexagonal columns these clouds commonly produce halos and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present they are formed by warm moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude when a warm front approaches cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later extraterrestrial 




cirrus clouds on mars


cirrus clouds have been observed on several other planets on 18 september 2008 the martian lander  took a  photograph of a group of cirrus clouds moving across the martian sky using lidar near the end of its mission the phoenix lander detected more thin clouds close to the north pole of mars over the course of several days they thickened lowered and eventually began snowing the total precipitation was only a few thousandths of a millimeter james whiteway from  concluded that  precipitation is a component of the    these clouds formed during the martian night in two layers one around 4,000m  13,000ft  above ground and the other at surface level they lasted through early morning before being burned away by the sun the crystals in these clouds were formed at a temperature of 65c  85f  and they were shaped roughly like ellipsoids 0.127millimeters long and 0.042millimeters wide on jupiter cirrus clouds are composed of  when jupiter s  disappeared one hypothesis put forward by glenn orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it hiding it from view nasa s  detected these clouds on saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on saturn s moon  cirrus clouds composed of  ice exist on uranus on neptune thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the  as on uranus these are probably methane crystals 
 are composed of tiny dust grains smaller than a  and are therefore not true clouds of this genus which are composed of ice crystals or other frozen liquids they range from a few  to dozens of light years across while they are not technically cirrus clouds the dust clouds are referred to as  cirrus  because of their similarity to the clouds on earth they also emit infrared radiation similar to the way cirrus clouds on earth reflect heat being radiated out into space see also
