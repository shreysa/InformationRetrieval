article i legislative role




president  signing the  in 1983 

the first power the  confers upon the president is the  the  requires that any bill passed by  to be presented to the president before it can become law once the legislation has been presented the president has three options 

sign the legislation within ten days excluding sundays the bill  veto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of congress in which it originated expressing any objections the bill does not become law unless both houses of congress vote to override the veto by a  take no action on the legislation within the above timeframe the bill becomes law as if the president had signed it unless congress by their adjournment prevents its return in which case a it does not become law  a legislative maneuver known as a   
in 1996 congress attempted to enhance the president s veto power with the  the legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill particularly any new spending any amount of discretionary spending or any new limited tax benefit congress could then repass that particular item if the president then vetoed the new legislation congress could override the veto by its ordinary means a two-thirds vote in both houses in      1998  the  ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional article ii executive powers
war and foreign affairs powers




 the 16th president of the united states successfully preserved the  during the 


perhaps the most important of all presidential powers is the command of the  as its  while the power to declare war is constitutionally vested in congress the president has ultimate responsibility for direction and disposition of the military the present-day operational command of the armed forces  belonging to the   is normally exercised through the  with assistance of the  to the  as outlined in the presidentially approved unified command plan  ucp  the framers of the constitution took care to limit the president s powers regarding the military   explains this in  

the president is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the united states  it would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces  while that  of the  extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies all  which  would appertain to the legislature  emphasis in the original 

congress pursuant to the  must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed rendering it ineffectual additionally congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation while historically presidents initiated the process for going to war critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations including  s military move into  in 1903 the  the  and the invasions of  in 1983 and  in 1990 along with the armed forces the president also directs  through the  and the department of defense the president is responsible for the protection of americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the united states the president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments and negotiates treaties with other nations which become binding on the united states when approved by two-thirds vote of the senate 
administrative powers


suffice it to say that the president is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the united states and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed 
      1977   
the president is the head of the executive branch of the federal government and is  to  take care that the laws be faithfully executed  the executive branch has over four million employees including members of the military presidents make numerous executive branch appointments  an incoming president may make up to 6,000 before taking office and 8,000 more while serving  members of the  and other federal officers are all appointed by a president with the   of a majority of the senate when the senate is in recess for at least ten days the president may make  recess appointments are temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the senate the power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue generally a president may remove purely executive officials at will however congress can curtail and constrain a president s authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute the president additionally possesses the ability to direct much of the executive branch through  that are grounded in  or constitutionally granted executive power executive orders are reviewable by federal courts and can be superseded by federal legislation and supreme court s decisions to manage the growing federal bureaucracy presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff who were eventually organized into the  within the executive office the president s innermost layer of aides  and their assistants  are located in the  president also has  unreviewable authority  over the matters of immigration and can ban entry to the usa of foreign nationals who have no credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states at will juridical powers
the president also has the power to nominate  including members of the  and the  however these nominations require  securing senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance when nominating judges to  presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of  presidents may also grant  and reprieves  bill clinton pardoned  on his last day in office  as is often done just before the end of a presidential term but not without controversy historically two doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy the first is  which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties  first claimed privilege when congress requested to see   s notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with  while not enshrined in the constitution or any other law washington s action created the precedent for the privilege when  tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to congress during the  the supreme court ruled in      1974  that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution when president  attempted to use executive privilege regarding the  the supreme court ruled in      1997  that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits these cases established the  that executive privilege is valid although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined additionally federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president 



president  delivering the  with   and   behind him


the  allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from  in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when  refused to release military documents in the  trial of  and again in      1876  when the supreme court dismissed a case brought by a former union spy however the privilege was not formally recognized by the u.s supreme court until      1953  where it was held to be a   privilege before the  use of the privilege had been rare but increasing in frequency since 2001 the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims as in the  s ruling in  critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions legislative facilitator
the constitution s  prevents the president  and all other executive officers  from simultaneously being a member of  therefore the president cannot directly introduce  for consideration in congress however the president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation especially if the president s political party has a majority in one or both houses of congress for example the president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into congress the president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated periodic reports to congress these reports may be either written or oral but today are given as the  address which often outlines the president s legislative proposals for the coming year additionally the president may attempt to have congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made in the 20th century critics began charging that too many legislative and budgetary powers have slid into the hands of presidents that should belong to congress as the head of the executive branch presidents control a vast array of  that can issue regulations with little oversight from congress one critic charged that presidents could appoint a  virtual army of  czars   each wholly unaccountable to congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the white house  presidents have been criticized for making  when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it this practice has been criticized by the  as unconstitutional conservative commentator  wrote of an  increasingly swollen executive branch  and  the eclipse of congress  according to  of the constitution the president may convene either or both houses of congress if both houses cannot agree on a date of adjournment the president may appoint a date for congress to adjourn ceremonial roles
