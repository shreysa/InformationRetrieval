logic and semantic networks an extended form of semantic network is defined which can be regarded as a syntactic variant of the clausal form of logic by virtue of its relationship with logic the extended semantic network is provided with a precise semantics inference rules and a procedural interpretation on the other hand by regarding semantic networks as an abstract data structure for the representation of clauses we provide a theorem-prover with a potentially useful indexing scheme and path-following strategy for guiding the search for a proof cacm March, 1979 Deliyanni, A.
