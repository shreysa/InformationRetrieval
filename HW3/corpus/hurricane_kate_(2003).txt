on september 21 a   a trough of relatively low atmospheric pressure  began moving slowly westward from the west coast of  passing near the  islands on september 23 though the wave was disorganized a low-level circulation developed on september 24 a few hundred miles to the southwest of cape verde steady organization ensued including the development of convection into curved  around the system though it lacked a well-defined center the system organized enough to be classified tropical depression sixteen on september 25 while located about 920mi  1,480km  west-southwest of the cape verde islands the depression moved northwestward due to a weakness in the  despite early predictions of steady strengthening to reach 60mph  95km h  within 48hours the depression remained weak due to strong south-southwesterly  the shear remained strong and though the  forecast the system to remain a depression through september 30 the depression unexpectedly strengthened to tropical storm kate on september 27 coinciding with an increase in deep convection near the center kate turned to the north and northeast and despite 35mph  55km h  of shear over the storm kate continued to strengthen a banding  developed early on september 29 and later that day it intensified into a hurricane while located 655mi  1,055km  southwest of the  hurricane kate maintained hurricane status for twelve hours before decelerating to the north and weakening to a tropical storm the storm then turned sharply west-southwestward while moving around the eastern side of a mid-level circulation passing over progressively warmer waters and into an area with decreasing vertical shear kate regained hurricane status on october 1 guided by an  to its north and a cyclonic circulation to its south the hurricane continued west-southwestward over the subtropical waters of 30n and presented a well-defined eye on october 2 on the next day it strengthened to attain major hurricane status and on october 4 hurricane kate reached a peak intensity of 125mph  205km h  while located 650mi  1,050km  east of

shortly after peaking the western portion of the central dense overcast or the area of high thick clouds around the eye began to deteriorate and hurricane kate started to weaken on october 5 the storm dropped below major hurricane status kate turned sharply northward due to it moving around the western periphery of a powerful anticyclone and consequently slowed its forward motion it slowly weakened as it turned to the north-northeast with an eye occasionally re-appearing on satellite images on october 7 however kate weakened to a tropical storm while moving over cooler waters it accelerated to the northeast and after passing about 260mi  420km  east of  kate became  as cold air clouds entrained the center the system remained a powerful system and later on october 8 the extratropical remnant of kate retained winds of up to 75mph  140km h  while passing south of  the storm turned to the east passed a short distance south of  and merged with another extratropical storm near  on october 10 preparations and impact 
just a week after  hit  the  emergency measures organization advised the general public to take appropriate actions for the anticipated effects of hurricane kate including high winds and potentially up to 3in  80mm  of rain such actions include securing loose objects cleaning debris from storm drains and owning appropriate hurricane supplies  such as a charged cell phone and batteries in the event of power outages  a cruise ship scheduled to stop in  bypassed newfoundland to avoid the storm the newfoundland and maritimes weather center issued a storm warning for  while the  issued a hurricane-force wind warning due to the expected combination of moisture from kate and a  the canadian hurricane centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern newfoundland offshore waves were expected to reach 33feet  10m  while marine wind warnings were issued as well from september 28 to october 7 33ships reported winds of over 40mph  65km h  in relation to kate though nearly all occurred as the storm was becoming extratropical the highest wind reported was 59mph  95km h  while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989 the interaction between kate and a high pressure area to its north produced 34foot  1m  waves along the coast of  and  the strongest winds of kate remained away from any landmasses though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40mph  65km h  at   the storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the  reaching heights of 913feet  34m  the combination of moisture from kate and a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall with some regions in southeastern newfoundland receiving more than 4inches  100mm   reported 1.8inches  45mm  on october 6 a record for the date due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks the ground easily absorbed the water resulting in a lack of flooding the extratropical remnant of hurricane kate produced winds of up to 70mph  110km h  in northern  overall there were no reports of damage or deaths associated with kate see also
