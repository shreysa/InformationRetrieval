within the region the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the  meteorologist  who named systems between 1887  1907 wragge used names drawn from the letters of the greek alphabet greek and roman mythology and female names to describe weather systems over   and the  after the new  had failed to create a federal weather bureau and appoint him director wragge started naming cyclones after political figures this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the region by the new caledonia meteorological office during the  during the  the  started to use female names for tropical cyclones that occurred within the australian region before the new zealand meteorological service s fiji office also started using female names for tropical cyclones within the south pacific during the  during the international women s year of 1975 the nzms decided to incorporate male names into the naming lists for the south pacific following a request from the fiji national council of women who considered the practice discrimination at around the same time the  ordered that tropical cyclones within the australian region should carry both men s and women s names this was because the minister thought  that both sexes should bear the odium of the devastation caused by cyclones  as a result male names were added to the lists of names for both basins ahead of the 197576 season later that decade as the dual sex naming of tropical cyclones started in the northern hemisphere the nzms looked at adding ethnic pacific names to the naming lists rather than the european names that were currently used as a result of the many languages and cultures in the pacific there was a lot of discussion surrounding this matter with one name  oni  being dropped as it meant the end of the world in one language one proposal suggested that cyclones be named from the country nearest to which they formed however this was dropped when it was realized that a cyclone might be less destructive in its formative stage than later in its development eventually it was decided to throw names from all over the south pacific into a pot at a training course where each course member provided a list of names that were short easily pronounced culturally acceptable throughout the pacific and did not contain any idiosyncrasies these names were then collated edited for suitability before being cross checked with the group for acceptability it was intended that the four lists of names should be alphabetical with alternative male and female names while using only ethnic names however it was not possible to complete the lists using only ethnic names so some european names were added in as a result there was a scattering of european names in the final naming lists which have been used by the  and nzms since the  the practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the  in the northern atlantic basin after hurricanes   and  struck the  and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced however it was decided at the 1969 interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired the first tropical cyclone name to be removed in the south pacific was rosie after it had impacted vanuatu and new caledonia during 1971 several names have been removed from the pacific naming lists for various other reasons than causing a significant amount of death destruction which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and political reasons tropical cyclone names retired in the 1970s
