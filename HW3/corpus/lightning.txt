lightning electrification 




the main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly  updraft  and temperatures range from 15 to 25 celsius


the details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification the main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly  updraft  and temperatures range from 15 to 25 celsius see figure to the right at that place the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets  small water droplets below freezing  small ice crystals and   soft hail  the updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward at the same time the graupel which is considerably larger and denser tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air 



when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel  soft hail  the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged 

the differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel  soft hail  the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged see figure to the left the updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud the larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm 



the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged 

the result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged the upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals  and positive charge  in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base this part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil while this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm  updrafts and downdrafts  in addition there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures general considerations

on earth the lightning frequency is approximately 4050 times a second or nearly 1.4  flashes per year and the average duration is 0.2 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes  strokes  of around 30  many factors affect the frequency distribution strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world these factors include ground elevation   currents  proximity to warm and cold bodies of water etc to a certain degree the ratio between ic cc and cg lightning may also vary by  in  because human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the earth where lightning can damage or destroy them cg lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types even though ic and cc are more common types of lightning lightning s relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation a typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting  channel through the air in excess of 5 kilometres  3.1mi  tall from within the cloud to the ground s surface the actual discharge is the final stage of a very complex process at its peak a typical  produces three or more strikes to the earth per minute lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere  however it can also occur during     and even in the cold of  where the lightning is known as   typically generate some lightning mainly in the rainbands as much as 160 kilometres  99mi  from the center the science of lightning is called fulminology and the fear of lightning is called  frequency

lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet as shown in the map about 70 of lightning occurs over land in the  where  is the greatest this occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder  as well as differences in moisture concentrations and it generally happens at the  the flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses such as the  partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the  because the influence of small or absent land masses in the vast stretches of the world s oceans limits the differences between these variants in the atmosphere lightning is notably less frequent there than over larger landforms the  and  are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning in general cloud-to-ground  cg  lightning flashes account for only 25 of all total lightning flashes worldwide since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged this is where most cg lightning originates this region is typically at the elevation where  occurs within the cloud freezing combined with collisions between ice and water appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process during wind-driven collisions ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge while a heavier slushy mixture of ice and water  called   develops a negative charge updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive  while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge

because the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground the proportion of cg strikes  versus cloud-to-cloud  cc  or in-cloud  ic  discharges  becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground in the tropics where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere only 10 of lightning flashes are cg at the latitude of norway  around 60 north latitude  where the freezing elevation is lower 50 of lightning is cg lightning is usually produced by   which have bases that are typically 12km  0.61.25miles  above the ground and tops up to 15km  9.3mi  in height lightning hotspots  the place on earth where lightning occurs most often is near the small village of  in the mountains of the eastern  where the  is around 975m  3,200ft  on average this region receives 158 lightning strikes per 1 square kilometer  0.39 sq mi  per year  in venezuela averages 297 days per year with lightning activity other lightning hotspots include  in   and  in central  necessary conditions

sound of a thunderstorm


in order for an  to occur two preconditions are necessary  firstly a sufficiently high  between two regions of space must exist and secondly a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free unimpeded equalization of the opposite charges it is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud  however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood the atmosphere provides the electrical insulation or barrier that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity this is overcome by  lightning  a complex process referred to as the lightning  flash  electrical field generation 




view of lightning from an airplane flying above a system 

as a  moves over the surface of the earth an equal  but of opposite polarity is  on the earth s surface underneath the cloud the induced positive surface charge when measured against a fixed point will be small as the thundercloud approaches increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes the referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve the oppositely charged regions create an  within the air between them this electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud  the greater the accumulated charge the higher the electrical field flashes and strikes 
the best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground  cg  although more common intracloud  ic  and cloud to cloud  cc  flashes are very difficult to study given there are no  physical  points to monitor inside the clouds also given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high cg frequency as such knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form cloud to ground

lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders positive shown in blue and negative in red


in a process not well understood a bidirectional channel of  air called a   is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through or are otherwise attracted to regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip the negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region also called a well inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well leaders often split forming branches in a tree-like pattern in addition negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion in a process called  stepping  the resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes it is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active when this happens the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash in a typical cloud-to-ground flash a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud the weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground the positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions positive upwards within the cloud and  towards the earth both ionic channels proceed in their respective directions in a number of successive spurts each leader  pools  ions at the leading tips shooting out one or more new leaders momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions then shooting out another leader the negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward often speeding up as it get closer to the earth s surface about 90 of ionic channel lengths between  pools  are approximately 45m  148ft  in length the establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time  hundreds of   in comparison to the resulting discharge which occurs within a few microseconds the  needed to establish the channel measured in the tens or hundreds of  is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge initiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood the electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself many hypotheses have been proposed one theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by  and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called  as these relativistic electrons collide and ionize neutral air molecules they initiate leader formation another theory invokes locally enhanced electric fields being formed near elongated water droplets or ice crystals  especially for the case of biased percolation   describes random connectivity phenomena which produce an evolution of connected structures similar to that of lightning strikes upward streamers 
when a stepped leader approaches the ground the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the strength of the  the electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud such as trees and tall buildings if the electric field is strong enough a positively charged ionic channel called a positive or upward  can develop from these points this was first theorized by heinz kasemir as negatively charged leaders approach increasing the localized electric field strength grounded objects already experiencing   and form upward streamers attachment 
once a downward leader connects to an available upward leader a process referred to as attachment a low-resistance path is formed and discharge may occur photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible the unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning none of which are connected to the earth although it may appear they are discharge

once a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below there is a large drop in resistance across the lightning channel electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light this is the  return stroke  and it is the most  and noticeable part of the lightning discharge a large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area this huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground called step potentials they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself  electricity takes every path available to it a portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes the electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative cg flash often referred to as  negative cg  lightning in some cases a ground to cloud  gc  lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm these discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures such as communications antennas the rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 1108 m s the massive flow of electric current occurring during the return stroke combined with the rate at which it occurs  measured in microseconds  rapidly  the completed leader channel forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel the core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 k causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color once the electric current stops flowing the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas the nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively producing a powerful  which is heard as  re-strike 
high-speed videos  examined frame-by-frame  show that most negative cg lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes though there may be as many as 30 each re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time typically 40 to 50 milliseconds as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes re-strikes often cause a noticeable   effect to understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader s connection with the ground positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do for reasons not well understood bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network these leaders also called recoil leaders usually decay shortly after their formation when they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network a return stroke-like process occurs and a dart leader travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader the dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes each successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel since recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article transient currents during flash 
the electric current within a typical negative cg lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 110 microseconds then decays more slowly over 50200 microseconds the transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor in what is called the  unlike direct currents which  flow through  the entire conductor like water through a hose hence conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded with small wires woven together this increases the total bundle  in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius for a fixed total  the rapidly changing currents also create  that radiate outward from the ionic channel this is a characteristic of all electrical discharges the radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases however if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines communication lines or metallic pipes they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination this is the   that more often than not results in the destruction of delicate   or  devices known as  attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash s transient irregular current and through an alteration of its physical properties route the spike to an attached  thereby protecting the equipment from damage types 
there are three primary types of lightning defined by what is at the  ends  of a flash channel 
intracloud  ic  which occurs within a single thundercloud unit
cloud to cloud  cc  or intercloud which starts and ends between two different  functional  thundercloud units
cloud to ground  cg  that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an earth surface but may also occur in the reverse direction that is ground to cloud

there are variations of each type such as  positive  versus  negative  cg flashes that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured different  used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events cloud to ground  cg 




cloud to ground lightning


cloud-to-ground  cg  lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground it is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud which met by a streamer moving up from the ground cg is the least common but best understood of all types of lightning it is easier to study scientifically because it terminates on a physical object namely the earth and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground of the three primary types of lightning it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or  strikes  the earth the overall discharge termed a flash is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown stepped leaders connecting leaders return strokes dart leaders and subsequent return strokes positive and negative lightning 
cloud-to-ground  cg  lightning is either positive or negative as defined by the direction of the  from cloud to ground most cg lightning is negative meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel the reverse happens in a positive cg flash where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground positive lightning is less common than negative lightning and on average makes up less than 5 of all lightning strikes 



a bolt from the blue lightning strike which appears to initiate from the clear but turbulent sky above the  and drive a bolt of plasma through the cloud directly to the ground they are commonly referred to as positive flashes despite the fact that they are usually negative in polarity 

there are six different mechanisms theorized to result in the formation of downward positive lightning 
vertical wind shear displacing the upper positive charge region of a thundercloud exposing it to the ground below the loss of lower charge regions in the dissipating stage of a thunderstorm leaving the primary positive charge region a complex arrangement of charge regions in a thundercloud effectively resulting in an inverted dipole or inverted tripole in which the main negative charge region is above the main positive charge region instead of beneath it an unusually large lower positive charge region in the thundercloud cutoff of an extended negative leader from its origin which creates a new bidirectional leader in which the positive end strikes the ground commonly seen in anvil-crawler spider flashes the initiation of a downward positive branch from an intracloud lightning flash 
contrary to popular belief positive lightning flashes do not necessarily originate from the anvil or the upper positive charge region and strike a rain-free area outside of the thunderstorm this belief is based on the outdated idea that lightning leaders are unipolar in nature and originating from their respective charge region positive lightning strikes tend to be much more intense than their negative counterparts an average bolt of  lightning carries an electric current of 30,000   30 ka  and transfers 15  of  and 500  of  large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 ka and 350 coulombs the average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash and can produce peak currents up to 400,000 amperes  400 ka  and charges of several hundreds coulombs furthermore positive ground flashes with high peak currents are commonly followed by long continuing currents a correlation not seen in negative ground flashes as a result of their greater power as well as lack of warning positive lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous due to the aforementioned tendency for positive ground flashes to produce both high peak currents and long continuing current they are capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited at the present time  are not designed to withstand such strikes since their existence was unknown at the time standards were set and the dangers unappreciated until the destruction of a  in 1999 the standard in force at the time of the crash advisory circular ac 20-53a was replaced by advisory circular ac 20-53b in 2006 however it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated aircraft operating in u.s airspace have been required to be equipped with  although their primary function is to mitigate radio interference due to static buildup through friction with the air in the event of a lightning strike a plane is designed to conduct the excess electricity through its skin and structure to the wicks to be safely discharged back into the atmosphere these measures however may be insufficient for positive lightning positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upward lightning flashes from the tops of tall structures and is largely responsible for the initiation of  several tens of kilometers above ground level positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in  as with  during intense  and in the dissipation stage of a  huge quantities of   elf  and   vlf   are also generated a unique form of cloud-to-ground lightning exists where lightning appears to exit from the cumulonimbus cloud and propagate a considerable distance through clear air before veering towards and striking the ground for this reason they are known as  bolts from the blue  despite the popular misconception that these are positive lightning strikes due to them seemingly originating from the positive charge region observations have shown that these are in fact negative flashes they begin as intracloud flashes within the cloud the negative leader then exits the cloud from the positive charge region before propagating through clear air and striking the ground some distance away  cloud to cloud  cc  and intra-cloud  ic

lightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground when it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as inter-cloud lightning and when it occurs between areas of differing  within a single cloud it is known as intra-cloud lightning intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type intra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper  portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm this lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called   in such instances the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder

another term used for cloudcloud or cloudcloudground lightning is  anvil crawler  due to the habit of charge typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes these are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay the most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing observational variations 

anvil crawler lightning sometimes called spider lightning is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems these discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region  the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area if the leader becomes too long it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders when this happens the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive cg flash or crawl on the underside of the cloud creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning  may be an  phenomenon the physical nature of which is still  the term refers to reports of  usually  objects which vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter it is sometimes associated with  but unlike lightning flashes which last only a fraction of a second ball lightning reportedly lasts many seconds ball lightning has been described by eyewitnesses but rarely recorded by  scientific data on natural ball lightning is scarce owing to its infrequency and unpredictability the presumption of its existence is based on reported public sightings and has therefore produced somewhat inconsistent findings brett porter wildlife ranger reported having taken a photo at queensland of australia in 1987 


bead lightning is the decaying stage of a lightning channel in which the  of the channel breaks up into segments nearly every lightning discharge will exhibit beading as the channel cools immediately after a return stroke sometimes referred to as the lightning s  bead-out  stage  bead lightning  is more properly a stage of a normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself beading of a lightning channel is usually a small-scale feature and therefore is often only apparent when the observer camera is close to the lightning cloud-to-air lightning is a lightning flash in which one end of a bidirectional leader exits the cloud but does not result in a ground flash such flashes can sometimes be thought of as failed ground flashes  are a form of cloud-to-air or cloud-to-ionosphere lightning where a leader is launched from the top of a thunderstorm  is used in   and the  for lightning that occurs with no  at the surface this type of lightning is the most common natural cause of   produce lightning for the same reason that it is produced by cumulonimbus clouds  


forked lightning is cloud-to-ground lightning that exhibits branching of its path  is a lightning flash that appears to produce no discernible  because it occurs too far away for the thunder to be heard the sound waves dissipate before they reach the observer 


ribbon lightning occurs in thunderstorms with high cross winds and multiple return strokes the wind will blow each successive return stroke slightly to one side of the previous return stroke causing a ribbon effect rocket lightning is a form of cloud discharge generally horizontal and at cloud base with a luminous channel appearing to advance through the air with visually resolvable speed often intermittently 


sheet lightning is cloud-to-cloud lightning that exhibits a diffuse brightening of the surface of a cloud caused by the actual discharge path being hidden or too far away the lightning itself cannot be seen by the spectator so it appears as only a flash or a sheet of light the lightning may be too far away to discern individual flashes 


smooth channel lightning is an informal term referring to a type of cloud-to-ground lightning strike that has no visible branching and appears like a line with smooth curves as opposed to the jagged appearance of most lightning channels they are a form of positive lightning generally observed in or near the convective regions of severe thunderstorms in the north central united states it is theorized that severe thunderstorms in this region obtain an  inverted tripole  charge structure in which the main positive charge region is located below the main negative charge region instead of above it and as a result these thunderstorms generate predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning the term  smooth channel lightning  is also sometimes attributed to upward ground-to-cloud lightning flashes which are generally negative flashes initiated by upward positive leaders from tall structures staccato lightning is a cloud-to-ground lightning  cg  strike which is a short-duration stroke that  often but not always  appears as a single very bright flash and often has considerable branching these are often found in the visual vault area near the  of rotating thunderstorms and coincides with intensification of thunderstorm  a similar cloud-to-cloud strike consisting of a brief flash over a small area appearing like a blip also occurs in a similar area of rotating updrafts

sympathetic lightning is the tendency of lightning to be loosely coordinated across long distances discharges can appear in clusters when viewed from space 


upward lightning or ground-to-cloud lightning is a lightning flash which originates from the top of a grounded object and propagates upward from this point this type of lightning can be triggered by a preceding lightning flash or it may initiate entirely on its own the former is generally found in regions where spider lightning occurs and may involve multiple grounded objects simultaneously the latter usually occurs during the cold season and may be the dominant lightning type in thundersnow events clear-air lightning describes lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it in the u.s and canadian  a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not observable from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes either visually or audibly european and asian mountainous areas experience similar events also in areas such as  large lakes or open plains when the storm cell is on the near horizon  within 26 kilometres  16mi  there may be some distant activity a strike can occur and as the storm is so far away the strike is referred to as a bolt from the blue these flashes usually begin as normal intracloud lightning flashes before the negative leader exits the cloud and strikes the ground a considerable distance away positive clear-air strikes can occur in highly-sheared environments where the upper positive charge region becomes horizontally displaced from the precipitation area

because the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration  dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a  audible as thunder since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning s path the sound origin s varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel by  from terrain and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike  at about 300,000,000m s and  travels through air at about 340m s an observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates a lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately 340 metres  0.21mi  in distance  a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about one kilometer  0.62mi   3340m  a flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately one mile  1.6km   5340m  consequently a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder with almost no perceptible time lapse possibly accompanied by the smell of   o3  high-energy radiation

volcanic material thrust high into the atmosphere can trigger lightning 

volcanic activity produces lightning-friendly conditions in multiple ways the enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected into the atmosphere creates a dense plume of particles the ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions  triboelectrification  resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself due to the extensive solid material  ash  content unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud it is often called a

airplane contrails have also been observed to influence lightning to a small degree the water vapor-dense contrails of airplanes may provide a lower resistance pathway through the atmosphere having some influence upon the establishment of an ionic pathway for a lightning flash to follow rocket exhaust plumes provided a pathway for lightning when it was witnessed striking the  shortly after takeoff  by providing extra material for electrical conduction and a very turbulent localized atmosphere have been seen triggering lightning flashes within the mushroom cloud in addition intense gamma radiation from large nuclear explosions may develop intensely charged regions in the surrounding air through  the intensely charged space charge regions create multiple clear-air lightning discharges shortly after the device detonates

the earliest detector invented to warn of the approach of a thunder storm was the   installed one such device in his house  the detector was based on an electrostatic device called the  electric chimes  invented by  in 1742 lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations including radio-frequency pulses the times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge the united states federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental u.s the  traps electromagnetic  and  waves electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide the waveguide is dispersive which means that their  depends on frequency the difference of the group time delay of a lightning pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver together with direction finding methods this allows to locate lightning strikes up to distances of 10,000km from their origin moreover the eigenfrequencies of the earth-ionospheric waveguide the  at about 7.5hz are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity in addition to ground-based lightning detection several instruments aboard satellites have been constructed to observe lightning distribution these include the optical transient detector  otd  aboard the orbview-1 satellite launched on april 3 1995 and the subsequent lightning imaging sensor  lis  aboard  launched on november 28 1997 artificially triggered 

rocket-triggered lightning can be  triggered  by launching  trailing spools of wire into thunderstorms the wire unwinds as the rocket ascends creating an elevated ground that can attract descending leaders if a leader attaches the wire provides a low-resistance pathway for a lightning flash to occur the wire is vaporized by the return current flow creating a straight lightning plasma channel in its place this method allows for scientific research of lightning to occur under a more controlled and predictable manner 
the international center for lightning research and testing  iclrt  at camp blanding florida typically uses rocket triggered lightning in their research studies 

laser-triggered

since the 1970s researchers have attempted to trigger lightning strikes by means of infrared or ultraviolet lasers which create a channel of ionized gas through which the lightning would be conducted to ground such triggering of lightning is intended to protect rocket launching pads electric power facilities and other sensitive targets in new mexico u.s scientists tested a new  laser which provoked lightning scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region the laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as  filaments  before the lightning strikes earth the filaments lead electricity through the clouds playing the role of lightning rods researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike nevertheless a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered according to the french and german scientists who ran the experiment the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimedin effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the

magnetism 
the movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field  see   the intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field where the lightning current path passes through rock soil or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized this effect is known as lightning-induced  magnetism or lirm these currents follow the least resistive path often horizontally near the surface but sometimes vertically where faults ore bodies or ground water offers a less resistive path one theory suggests that  natural magnets encountered in ancient times were created in this manner lightning-induced magnetic anomalies can be mapped in the ground and analysis of magnetized materials can confirm lightning was the source of the magnetization and provide an estimate of the peak current of the lightning discharge solar wind and cosmic rays 
some high energy cosmic rays produced by supernovas as well as solar particles from the solar wind enter the atmosphere and electrify the air which may create pathways for lightning bolts in culture and religion

lightning by   1909 


in many cultures lightning has been viewed as part of a deity or a deity in and of itself these include the   the  god  the    s  the     in   in  the  god  and the  god  in the traditional religion of the african  tribes lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods verses in the  religion and in  also ascribe supernatural importance to lightning in  the  of  is compared to lightning the expression  lightning never strikes twice  in the same place  is similar to  opportunity never knocks twice  in the vein of a  once in a lifetime  opportunity i.e something that is generally considered improbable lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas since various factors alter the  of strikes at any given location repeat lightning strikes have a very low probability  but are not impossible  similarly  a bolt from the blue  refers to something totally unexpected some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power such as the  in  the  during the 1930s and the  in the  during the 1950s the  the  wing of the  used the  in their logo which symbolizes lightning the  word  which means  lightning war  was a major offensive strategy of the german army during  in  and  the expression for  love at first sight  is coup de foudre and colpo di fulmine respectively which literally translated means  lightning strike  some european languages have a separate word for lightning which strikes the ground  as opposed to lightning in general  often it is a  of the english word  rays  the name of  s most celebrated  horse  derives from the shared  and  word for lightning the bolt of lightning in  is called a  and is shown as a zigzag with non-pointed ends this symbol usually represents power and speed the lightning bolt is used to represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered  and  it was a commonly used motif in  design especially the  art deco design of the late 1920s the lightning bolt is a common insignia for  units throughout the world a lightning bolt is also the  the unicode symbol for lightning is  u 2607
