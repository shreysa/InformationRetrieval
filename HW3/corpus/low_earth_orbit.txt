orbital characteristics 
objects in leo encounter atmospheric drag from  in the   approximately 80500km up  or   approximately 500km and up  depending on orbit height due to atmospheric drag satellites do not usually orbit below 300km objects in leo orbit earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner   orbited at about 255 km and had an aerodynamic shape and ion thrusters to reduce and compensate for atmospheric drag the mean orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low earth orbit is about 7.8km s but reduces with increased orbital altitude calculated for circular orbit of 200km it is 7.79km s and for 1500km it is 7.12km s the  needed to achieve low earth orbit starts around 9.4km s  and  associated with launch typically adds 1.31.8km s to the launch vehicle  required to reach normal leo orbital velocity of around 7.8km s  28,080km h  


equatorial low earth orbits  eleo  are a subset of leo these orbits with low inclination to the equator allow rapid revisit times and have the lowest  requirement  i.e fuel spend  of any orbit orbits with a high inclination angle to the equator are usually called  higher orbits include   meo  sometimes called intermediate circular orbit  ico  and further above   geo  orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense  and charge accumulation use of leo

although the earth s pull due to  in leo is not much less than on the surface of the earth people and objects in orbit experience  because they are in free fall a low earth orbit is simplest and cheapest for satellite placement it provides high bandwidth and low communication time lag   but satellites in leo will not be visible from any given point on the earth at all times examples 

 and  use leo as they are able to see the surface of the earth more clearly as they are not so far away they are also able to traverse the surface of the earth a majority of artificial  are placed in leo making one complete revolution around the  in about 90 minutes the  is in a leo about 400km  250mi  above earth s surface and needs reboosting a few times a year due to orbital decay since it requires less energy to place a satellite into a leo and the leo satellite needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission leo is used for many communication applications because these leo orbits are not geostationary a network  or   of satellites is required to provide continuous coverage  many  require  and move at the same angular velocity as the earth some communications satellites including the  use leo 
lower orbits also aid  satellites because of the added detail that can be gained remote sensing satellites can also take advantage of  at an altitude of about 800km  500mi  and near polar inclination  is one example of an earth observation satellite that makes use of this particular type of leo  orbited at about 255km  158mi  to measure earth s gravity field the  orbits at about 540km  340mi  above earth 
space debris 
the leo environment is becoming congested with  due to the frequency of object launches this has caused growing concern in recent years since collisions at orbital velocities can easily be dangerous and even deadly collisions can produce even more space debris in the process creating a  something known as  the  part of   formerly the united states space command  currently tracks more than 8,500 objects larger than 10cm in leo however a limited  study suggested there could be approximately one million objects larger than 2 millimeters which are too small to be visible from earth-based observatories see also
