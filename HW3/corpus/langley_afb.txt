langley field was named after  an aerodynamic pioneer and a former secretary of the  langley began aerodynamic experiments in 1887 and formed a basis for practical pioneer aviation he built and saw the first steam model airplane in 1896 and the first gasoline model in 1903 both planes were believed to be capable of flight he also built the first man-carrying gasoline airplane in 1903 which failed to fly on its first attempt and broke apart and crashed on its second it was after major modification eleven years later flown  successfully  by glenn curtiss for a little over 3 seconds traveling 150 feet through the air in 1914 langley field was the first air service base built especially for air power is the oldest continually active air force base in the world and is the oldest airfield in virginia origins 
in 1916 the national advisory council for aeronautics  naca  predecessor to nasa established the need for a joint airfield and proving ground for army navy and naca aircraft naca determined that the site must be near water for over-water flying be flat and relatively clear for expansion and the landing and take-off of aircraft and near an army post the army appointed a board of officers who searched for a location the officers sometimes posed as hunters and fishermen to avoid potential land speculation which would arise if the government s interest in purchasing land was revealed fifteen locations were scouted before a site near hampton in  was selected
