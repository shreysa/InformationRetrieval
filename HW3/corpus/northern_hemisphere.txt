geography and climate 
the arctic is the region north of the  its climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow the arctic experiences some days in summer when the sun never sets and some days during the winter when it never rises the duration of these phases varies from one day for locations right on the arctic circle to several months near the  which is the middle of the northern hemisphere between the arctic circle and the  lies the  the changes in these regions between summer and winter are generally mild rather than extreme hot or cold however a temperate climate can have very unpredictable weather  regions  between the tropic of cancer and the   are generally hot all year round and tend to experience a  during the summer months and a  during the winter months in the northern hemisphere objects moving across or above the surface of the earth tend to turn to the right because of the  as a result large-scale horizontal flows of air or water tend to formturning  these are best seen in ocean circulation patterns in the  and  oceans for the same reason flows of air down toward the northern surface of the earth tend to spread across the surface in a clockwise pattern thus clockwise air circulation is characteristic of  weather cells in the northern hemisphere conversely air rising from the northern surface of the earth  creating a region of low pressure  tends to draw air toward it in a counterclockwise pattern  and   massive low-pressure systems  spin  in the northern hemisphere the shadow of a sundial moves clockwise in the northern hemisphere  opposite of the   during the day the sun tends to rise to its maximum at a southerly position except between the tropic of cancer and the equator where the sun can be seen to the north directly overhead or to the south at noon dependent on the time of year when viewed from the northern hemisphere the  appears inverted compared to a view from the southern hemisphere the north pole faces away from the galactic center of the  this results in the milky way being sparser and dimmer in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere making the northern hemisphere more suitable for deep-space observation as it is not  blinded  by the milky way the northern hemisphere is home to approximately 6.57 billion people which is around 90 of the earth s total human population of 7.3 billion people list of continents
