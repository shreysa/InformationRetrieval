a small amount of slush can be produced from a mixture of rain and snow



rain and snow mixed or sleet is  composed of  and partially melted  unlike  which are hard and  which is fluid until striking an object this precipitation is soft and  but it contains some traces of  from partially fused snowflakes in any one location it usually occurs briefly as a transition phase from rain to snow or vice versa its  code is rasn

terminology 
this precipitation type is commonly known as sleet in most commonwealth countries including canada however the   uses the term sleet to refer to  formation 




rain snow mix soundings  left diagram shows typical skew-t appearance while right diagram shows variations which result in mixtures of rain and snow


this precipitation occurs when the  in the lowest part of the atmosphere is slightly above the  of water  0c or 32f  the depth of low-level warm air  below the freezing level  needed to melt snow falling from above to rain varies from about 230460m  7501,500ft  and depends on the mass of the flakes and the lapse rate of the melting layer rain and snow typically mix when the melting layer depth falls between these values 
 wintry showers  or  wintry mixes 
wintry showers is a somewhat informal meteorological term used primarily in the  to refer to various mixtures of rain  and snow though no  official  criteria exist for the term in the united kingdom the term is not used when any significant accumulation of snow on the ground takes place it is often used when the temperature of the ground surface is above 0c  32f  preventing accumulation from occurring even if the air temperature is marginally below 0c  32f  but even then the falling  must generally be something other than exclusively snow in the  wintry mix generally refers to a mixture of   and snow in contrast to the usage in the united kingdom in the united states it is usually used when air and ground temperatures are below 0c  32f  additionally it is generally used when some accumulation of ice and snow is expected to occur during winter a wide area can be affected by the multiple precipitation types typical of a wintry mix during a single winter storm as counter-clockwise winds around a storm system bring warm air northwards ahead of the system and then bring cold air back southwards behind it most often it is the region ahead of the approaching storm system which sees the wintry mix as warm air moves northward and above retreating cold air causing snow to change to ice pellets freezing rain and finally rain the reverse transition can occur behind the departing low pressure system though it is more common for precipitation to change directly from rain to snow or for it to stop before a transition back see also
