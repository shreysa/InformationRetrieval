purpose and function 




two noaa 


noaa plays several specific roles in society the benefits of which extend beyond the u.s economy and into the larger global community 

a supplier of environmental information products noaa supplies to its customers and partners information pertaining to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere this is clear through the production of weather warnings and forecasts via the  but noaa s information products extend to climate ecosystems and commerce as well a provider of environmental stewardship services noaa is a steward of u.s coastal and marine environments in coordination with federal state local tribal and international authorities noaa manages the use of these environments regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species a leader in applied scientific research noaa is intended to be a source of accurate and objective scientific information in the four particular areas of national and global importance identified above  ecosystems climate weather and water and commerce and transportation 
the five  fundamental activities  are 

monitoring and observing earth systems with instruments and data collection networks understanding and describing earth systems through research and analysis of that data assessing and predicting the changes of these systems over time engaging advising and informing the public and partner organizations with important information managing resources for the betterment of society economy and environment 
history 




seal of the noaa commissioned corps


noaa was formed on october 3 1970 after u.s president  proposed creating a new agency to serve a national need for  better protection of life and property from natural hazardsfor a better understanding of the total environment for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources  noaa formed a conglomeration of several existing scientific agencies that were among the oldest in the federal government they were the  formed in 1807  the  formed in 1870geodetic survey and weather service had been combined by a 1965 consolidation into the   essa  including the uniformed   founded 1917  and the  formed in 1871 noaa was established within the department of commerce via the reorganization plan no 4 of 1970 in 2007 noaa celebrated 200 years of service with its ties to the united states coast and  survey organizational structure

the   nws  is tasked with providing  weather hydrologic and climate forecasts and warnings for the  its territories adjacent waters and ocean areas for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy  this is done through a collection of national and regional centers 13 river forecast centers  rfcs  and more than 120 local weather forecast offices  wfos  they are charged with issuing weather and river   on a daily basis they issue more than 734,000 weather and 850,000 river forecasts and more than 45,000  annually noaa data is also relevant to the issues of  and  
the nws operates  a nationwide network of doppler  which can detect  and their velocities many of their products are broadcast on  a network of radio  that broadcasts weather forecasts severe weather statements watches and warnings 24 hours a day national ocean service 
the   nos  focuses on ensuring that ocean and coastal areas are safe healthy and productive nos scientists natural resource managers and specialists serve america by ensuring safe and efficient marine transportation promoting innovative solutions to protect coastal communities and conserving marine and coastal places 
the national ocean service is composed of eight program offices  the center for operational oceanographic products and services the coastal services center the national centers for coastal ocean science the  the office of  the office of  the office of ocean and coastal resource management and the  there are two nos programs namely the  and the noaa integrated ocean observing system  ioos  and two staff offices the international program office and the management and budget office national environmental satellite data and information service

the national oceanic and atmospheric administration flag flown as a distinguishing mark by all commissioned noaa ships 

the noaa flag is a modification of the flag of one of its predecessor organizations the  the coast and geodetic survey s flag authorized in 1899 and in use until 1970 was blue with a white circle centered in it and a red triangle centered within the circle it symbolized the use of  in  and was flown by ships of the survey 
when noaa was established in 1970 and the coast and geodetic survey s assets became a part of noaa noaa based its own flag on that of the coast and geodetic survey the noaa flag is in essence the coast and geodetic survey flag with the noaa logoa circle divided by the silhouette of a seabird into an upper dark blue and a lower light blue section but with the  noaa  legend omittedcentered within the red triangle noaa ships in  display the noaa flag  those with only one  fly it immediately beneath the ship s  or the personal flag of a civilian official or  if one is aboard the ship while multimasted vessels fly it at the masthead of the forwardmost mast noaa ships fly the same  as  ships but fly the noaa flag as a distinguishing mark to differentiate themselves from navy ships see also
