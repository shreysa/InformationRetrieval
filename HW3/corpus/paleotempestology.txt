 tempestology  redirects here for the generalized study of storms see  for the origins of storms and tropical cyclones see  and  
paleotempestology is the study of past  activity by means of geological proxies as well as historical documentary records the term was coined by

methods
examples of proxies include  deposits preserved in the  of coastal lakes and   such as      contained in coastal sediments wave-generated or flood-generated sedimentary structures or deposits  called   in marine or  sediments storm wave deposited  shingle shell sand and shell and pure sand shore parallel ridges the method of using overwash deposits preserved in coastal lake and marsh sediments is adopted from earlier studies of paleotsunami deposits both  and  leave very similar if not identical sedimentary deposits in coastal lakes and marshes and differentiating between the two in a sedimentary record can be difficult the first studies to examine prehistoric records of tropical cyclones occurred in australia and the south pacific during the late 1970s and early 1980s these studies examined multiple shore parallel ridges of coral shingle or sand and marine shells as many as 50 ridges can be deposited at a site with each representing a past severe  over the previous 6,000 years tsunamis are not known to deposit multiple sedimentary ridges and therefore these features can be more easily attributed to a past storm at any given site coastal sedimentary analyses have been done at the  the  coast from  up to  and  and the  also studies on pre-historic tropical cyclones hitting  have been made a study covering the  coast has also been published markers in coral 
rocks contain certain  of  known as natural tracers which describe the conditions under which they formed by studying the  in coral rock past sea surface temperature and hurricane information can be revealed heavier  isotopes   decrease in relation to lighter oxygen isotopes   in coral during periods of very heavy  since hurricanes are the main source of extreme rainfall in the tropical oceans  past hurricane events can be dated to the days of their impact on the coral by looking at the decreased 18o concentration within the coral speleothems and tree rings 
isotope studies in  and tree rings   offers a means by which higher resolution records of long-term tropical cyclone histories can be attained unlike the isotope records the sedimentary records are too coarse in their resolution to register quasi-cyclic activity at decadal to centennial scales these higher resolution records therefore offer a means for possibly differentiating between the natural variability of tropical cyclone behaviour and the effects of anthropogenically induced global  recent studies with  in  shows that events can be determined on a week-by-week basis historical records

before the invention of the  in the early to mid-19th century news was as fast as the fastest horse or stagecoach or ship normally there was no advance warning of a tropical cyclone impact however the situation changed in the 19th century as seafaring people and land-based researchers such as father vies in  came up with systematic methods of reading the sky s appearance or the sea state which could foretell a tropical cyclone s approach up to a couple days in advance one of the best documented storms is the  of 1859 which caused over 800 deaths in the uk alone it led directly to the formation of the  under  however wind speed could not be measured accurately at the time methods only becoming available after the  of 1879 one of the better sources for storms in and around  is the  statistics compiled annually by the  but which have yet to be analysed in detail michael chenoweth used 18th century journals to reconstruct the climate of  together with dmitry divine he also created a 318-year  16902007  record of tropical cyclones in the  using newspaper accounts ships   meteorological journals and other document sources in  the abundance of historical documentary records in the form of fang zhi  semiofficial local   offers an extraordinary opportunity for providing a high-resolution historical dataset for the frequency of  strikes see also
