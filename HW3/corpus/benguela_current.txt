benguela current in the 


the benguela current  is the broad northward flowing  that forms the eastern portion of the   the current extends from roughly  in the south to the position of the  front in the north at around 16s the current is driven by the prevailing south easterly trade winds inshore of the benguela current proper the south easterly winds drive  forming the benguela upwelling system the cold nutrient rich waters that upwell from around 200300 m depth in turn fuel high rates of phytoplankton growth and sustain the productive benguela ecosystem

the courses of the warm agulhas current  red  along the east coast of south africa and the cold benguela current  blue  along the west coast originating in the  and  respectively note that the benguela current does not originate from antarctic waters in the south atlantic ocean but from upwelling of water from the cold depths of the atlantic ocean against the west coast of the continent the two currents do not  meet  anywhere along the south coast of africa 

source waters for the benguela include cold upwelled waters from the depths of the atlantic ocean close inshore joined further off-shore by nutrient poor water that has crossed the southern atlantic from south america as part of  eddies from the warm south indian ocean  along south africa s east coast do round the  from time to time to join the bengulela current the benguela current is 200 to 300km wide and widens further as it flows north and northwest its western seaward edge is well-defined with many temporary and seasonal eddies and meanders there is however a well-defined thermal front between the waters associated with the benguela upwelling system and those of the eastward flowing atlantic currents which are not deflected northward by the african continent the icy benguela and the warm south-flowing  do not meet off the   see diagram on the right above  but there is a body of water off the south african south coast east and particularly west of  that consists of eddies from both currents so that off-shore water temperatures along the south coast of africa vary chaotically 



the red areas show major upwelling areas the benguela current is on the southwest coast of africa 

upwelling and primary production

northward winds along the coast result in  offshore and  of nutrient rich deep water to the  the intensity of the upwelling event is determined by wind strength variations in wind strength cause pulses of upwelling which propagate to the south along the coast with speeds of 5 to 8m s the pulses are similar to a  except on a scale of 30 to 60km instead of 1000km and can propagate around the cape depending on wind systems pulses of upwelling induce biological production in the benguela system  growth requires a period of upwelling followed by a period of stratification and relatively calm waters the phytoplankton bloom usually lags the upwelling event by 1 to 4 days and blooms for 4 to 10 days in order for  to have a continuous food supply the phytoplankton blooms must not occur too far apart pulses of upwelling in the benguela system regularly have a duration of 10 days an optimal period for biological production it is estimated that the annual new production in the benguela system is 4.7  10^13 gc y making the benguela system 30 to 65 times more productive per unit area than the global ocean average while upwelling promotes abundant primary and secondary production in the upper parts of the water column and near the coast deeper waters with limited oxygen exchange create hypoxic areas called  at the coastal shelf and upper coastal slope the benguela oxygen minimum zone starts around a depth of 100 m and is a few hundred meters thick bacteria that use sulpher rather than oxygen reside in the oxygen minimum zone the most abundant fishes in the benguela system are sardinops and engraulis sardinops ocelata   was intensely fished beginning in the 1950s and peaking in 1968 with landings over 1.3 million tons since then the sardinops fishery has declined and the engraulis capensis   fishery has taken over benguela nio 
similar to the pacific  a thick slab of warm nutrient poor water enters the northern part of the benguela upwelling system off the  coast about once per decade during the benguela nio warm salty waters from the  move southward from 15s to as far as 25s this slab of warm salty water extends to 150km offshore and to 50 m depth heavy rains changes in fish abundance and temporal proximity to the pacific el nio have been observed  however the causes and effects of the benguela nio are not well understood one research team has shown that the benguela nio is caused by winds in the west-central equatorial  that propagate as subsurface sea temperature anomalies to the african coast a recent study has demonstrated the importance of local winds in the development of the benguela nio off the coast of namibia and angola this local process together with the remote signal from the equatorial regions form the basis of the formation mechanism in which both processes sometimes reinforce each other see also
