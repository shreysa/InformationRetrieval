condensation forming in the low pressure zone above the wing of an aircraft due to  expansion


condensation is the change of the physical  from  into  and is the reverse of  the word most often refers to the  it can also be defined as the change in the state of water vapour to liquid water when in contact with a liquid or solid surface or  within the  when the transition happens from the gaseous phase into the solid phase directly the change is called   or desublimation see

initiation 
condensation is initiated by the formation of  of that species within its gaseous volumelike  or  formation within or at the contact between such gaseous phase and a liquid or solid surface reversibility scenarios 
a few distinct reversibility scenarios emerge here with respect to the nature of the surface 
absorption into the surface of a liquid  either of the same substance or one of its solvents is reversible as    as dew droplets  onto solid surface at pressures and temperatures higher than the species  also reversible as evaporation adsorption onto solid surface  as supplemental layers of solid  at pressures and temperatures lower than the species  is reversible as  
most common scenarios 
condensation commonly occurs when a  is cooled and or compressed to its  when the molecular density in the gas phase reaches its maximal threshold vapor cooling and compressing equipment that collects condensed liquids is called a  how condensation is measured 
 measures the rates of condensation through evaporation into the air moisture at various atmospheric pressures and temperatures water is the product of its vapor condensationcondensation is the process of such phase conversion applications of condensation 




in  a liquid  sometimes water but usually   condenses upon contact with a  of  thus producing an effect similar to 


condensation is a crucial component of  an important laboratory and industrial chemistry application because condensation is a naturally occurring phenomenon it can often be used to generate water in large quantities for human use many structures are made solely for the purpose of collecting water from condensation such as  and  such systems can often be used to retain soil moisture in areas where active  is occurringso much so that some organizations educate people living in affected areas about water condensers to help them deal effectively with the situation it is also a crucial process in forming particle tracks in a  in this case ions produced by an incident particle act as nucleation centers for the condensation of the vapor producing the visible  cloud  trails furthermore condensation is a critical step in many industrial processes such as power generation water desalination thermal management refrigeration and air conditioning biological adaptation 
numerous living beings use water made accessible by condensation a few examples of these are the   the  of the  coast and the  of the  condensation in building construction

condensation in building  is an unwanted  as it may cause      weakening of mortar and masonry walls and energy penalties due to increased  to alleviate these issues the indoor air humidity needs to be lowered or air ventilation in the building needs to be improved this can be done in a number of ways for example opening windows turning on extractor fans using dehumidifiers drying clothes outside and covering pots and pans whilst cooking air conditioning or ventilation systems can be installed that help remove moisture from the air and move air throughout a building the amount of water vapour that can be stored in the air can be increased simply by increasing the temperature however this can be a double edged sword as most condensation in the home occurs when warm moisture heavy air comes into contact with a cool surface as the air is cooled it can no longer hold as much water vapour this leads to deposition of water on the cool surface this is very apparent when central heating is used in combination with single glazed windows in winter interstructure condensation may be caused by  insufficient or lacking insulation  or  see also
