meteorological history 




map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the 


in early-mid june1972 atmospheric conditions favored  in the  banded convection developed in the northwestern caribbean sea by june11 though the system did not significantly organize after an upper trough moved east wind shear decreased causing lower  observations in   mexico it is estimated that a tropical depression developed by 1200utc on june14 while centered over the yucatn peninsula about 78 miles  126km  southeast of  the depression tracked eastward and entered the western caribbean sea on june15 operationally the  did not initiate advisories on the depression until 1500utc on june15 early on june16 at 0000utc the depression strengthened into tropical storm agnes however the depression was not operationally upgraded until sixteen hours later after becoming a tropical storm on june16 agnes slowly curved northward and approached the  late on june17 it was noted that projected path indicated the possibly of landfall in western cuba however the storm remained offshore though it closely brushed the western tip of cuba at 1200utc on june18 agnes intensified into a hurricane while in the southeastern gulf of mexico prematurely the national hurricane center operationally upgraded agnes to a hurricane at 0200utc on that day upon becoming a hurricane agnes attained its maximum sustained winds of 85mph  140km h  though it had not reached its minimum atmospheric pressure due to unfavorable conditions agnes leveled-off slightly in intensity and weakened to a minimal hurricane while approaching the  shortly before 2200utc on june19 agnes made landfall near cape san blas florida with winds of 75mph  120km h  



remnants of agnes over northeastern united states


at 0000utc on june20 only a few hours after moving inland agnes weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the florida georgia stateline agnes rapidly weakened to a tropical depression while over georgia the depression curved northeastward and eventually to the east-northeast after entering south carolina though the storm had not dissipated the national hurricane center issued its final bulletin on agnes at 1600utc on june20 by early on june21 a large extratropical trough spawned a low pressure area which resulted in baroclinic activity as a result agnes restrengthened into a tropical storm at 1800utc on june21 while centered over eastern north carolina three hours later the national hurricane center noted decreasing atmospheric pressures and indicated that winds had reached gale-force winds and once again upgraded agnes to a tropical storm by early on june22 agnes emerged into the northwestern atlantic ocean where it continued to re-intensify at 1200utc agnes reached its minimum atmospheric pressure of 977mbar  28.9inhg  as reported by a reconnaissance aircraft however maximum sustained winds were at only 70mph  110km h  late on june22 agnes made its final landfall on  on  with winds of 65mph  100km h  agnes began its long life as an  once cold air invaded its circulation late on june22 the system looped across south-central pennsylvania on june23 and then looped across southern ontario on june25 it spawned a tornado in maniwaki ontario early that day which killed two and injured 11people the cyclone sped east-northeast reaching  on june27 before intensifying as it re-entered the north atlantic after moving as far north as the 61stparallel while crossing the 25thmeridian west on the morning of june29 agnes turned southeastward its central pressure bottomed out near 980 millibars  29inhg  towards 0000 utc on june30 between july1 and july3 the long-lived system looped between ireland and iceland while weakening once more the system turned northeast strengthening one more time while accelerating across the  on july4 through 5 a stronger system moving in from the west finally absorbed agnes on july6 while finally located to the southeast of iceland preparations 
by 2200utc on june17 the  issued gale warnings and a hurricane watch for the  and the  from  to  on the following day at 1600utc another hurricane watch was put into effective from  to  in addition the gale warnings in the florida keys were extended to include areas from  to  at 2200utc on june18 a hurricane warning became effective from  to  the gale warnings which were in effect for the florida keys and fort myers beach to clearwater was discontinued at 1000utc on june19 it is likely that the hurricane warning was discontinued after the national hurricane center downgraded agnes to a tropical storm at 2200utc on june20 two hours later all gale warnings along the west coast of florida were discontinued impact

following the storm then  declared 14counties in florida as a disaster area including  brevard county  franklin county  hillsborough county    monroe county  pasco county pinellas county sarasota county and wakulla county in  where over 25,000tourists evacuated effects were not significant as a result the city lost millions of dollars from tourism which led the officials of panama city to file a  100million lawsuit against the  officials in that city believed that the national weather service and other media outlets made  exaggerated and erroneous  forecasts and reports on the storm 20of maryland s 24counties were declared a disaster area following the storm then  declared the states of florida virginia maryland pennsylvania and new york as disaster areas agnes had a devastating impact on the already  in the northeastern united states as lines were washed out and shipments were delayed 

the   el  estimated that damage between binghamton and salamanca new york amounted to  2 million el filed for chapter 77 bankruptcy the  sustained nearly  20 million in damages

the resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed  
the severe floods near lawrenceville pennsylvania were the catalyst for the construction of the  in 1973 the flooding in  and the adjacent town of  led to the construction of a  system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and in the same year was deemed very safe and protective by the  the levee also protected the area from the remnants of tropical storm lee and hurricane irene in 2011 with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure conversely the existing  built against the wishes of the  spared much of  from the worst flooding by filling the  to capacity retirement
