a ground blizzard in ontario march 21st 2004


ground blizzard refers to a  condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds the primary difference between a ground blizzard and a regular  is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface

meteorological criteria 
while the term  ground blizzard  is often associated with intense blowing and drifting snow conditions there are specific criteria which must be met often such criteria will be determined by a country s governing weather agency or other similar body in the u.s according to the national weather service a blizzard is defined as having sustained winds or frequent gusts of 35mph or more visibility frequently below 1 4mile in considerable snow and or blowing snow and the above conditions are expected to prevail for 3hours or longer environment canada similarly maintains that the temperature must be colder than 0c widespread reduction of visibility to less than 1kilometer due to snow and or blowing snow and sustained wind speeds or gusts of 40km h or more with all these conditions persisting for at least 4hours  6hours for the northwest territories and nunavut 
types 
there are 3 different forms of ground blizzards 

in  conditions the winds blow across the surface of the earth with very little if any large-scale upward motion in  conditions the winds exhibit large-scale upward motion lifting the snow into the atmosphere creating drifting waves of snow up to 500meters in height in  mixing conditions massive convective rolls form in the atmosphere and the blizzard may be observed from space with the blizzards convective rolls creating waves of snow  also known as   resembling lake or ocean effect snow bands the extreme conditions can quickly bury a two story home and make breathing very difficult if not impossible if caught outdoors

climatology 
ground blizzards occur throughout the world however unlike other winter storms topography either aids in their formation or prevention the most important topographic element in a blizzard is the requirement for a vast amount of large open and relatively flat land any type of flora especially coniferous forms will catch any drifting snow significantly reducing the blizzards effects the environment must also support temperatures cold enough to prevent any snow on the ground from melting and bonding the ice crystals together ground blizzards are most common in the arctic and antarctic during seasonal transition periods such as the spring and fall ground blizzards are also common in the canadian prairies and u.s midwest as well as siberia and northern china famous ground blizzards
