the term trade winds originally derives from the early fourteenth century late  word  trade  meaning  path  or  track  the portuguese recognized the importance of the trade winds  then the  meaning in portuguese  turn of the sea  but also  return from the sea  in navigation in both the north and south atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century from west africa the portuguese had to sail away from continental portugal that is to west and northwest they could then turn northeast to the area around the  islands and finally east to mainland europe they also learned that to reach south africa they needed to go far out in the ocean head for brazil and around 30s go east again following the african coast southbound means upwind in the southern hemisphere in the pacific ocean the full wind circulation which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher-latitude  was unknown to europeans until  s voyage in 1565 the captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel during the  the pattern of  made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access and therefore had a direct effect on european empire-building and thus on modern political geography for example  could not sail into the wind at all by the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to england s merchant fleet for crossing the atlantic ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of  trade   foreign  commerce  between 1847 and 1849  collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world s oceans cause

clouds which form above regions within trade wind regimes are typically composed of cumulus which extend no more than 4 kilometres  13,000ft  in height and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion trade winds originate more from the direction of the poles  northeast in the northern hemisphere southeast in the southern hemisphere  during the cold season and are stronger in the winter than the summer as an example the windy season in the  which lie at low latitudes in  occurs between january and april when the phase of the   ao  is warm trade winds are stronger within the tropics the cold phase of the ao leads to weaker trade winds when the trade winds are weaker more extensive areas of rain fall upon landmasses within the tropics such as  during mid-summer in the northern hemisphere  july  the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving  expand northwestward from the  into southeastern north america  florida and gulf coast  when dust from the  moving around the southern periphery of the ridge travels over land rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets its presence negatively impacts  by adding to the count of airborne particulates although the southeast usa has some of the cleanest air in north america much of the african dust that reaches the united states affects florida since 1970 dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in africa there is a large variability in the dust transport to the caribbean and florida from year to year dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of  across the caribbean and florida primarily since the 1970s see also
