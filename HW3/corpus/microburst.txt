a microburst is a small  that moves in a way opposite to a  microbursts are found in strong thunderstorms there are two types of microbursts within a   wet microbursts and dry microbursts they go through three stages in their cycle the downburst outburst and cushion stages a microburst can be particularly dangerous to  especially during landing due to the  caused by its  several fatal and historic crashes have been attributed to the phenomenon over the past several decades and  training goes to great lengths on how to properly recover from a microburst wind shear event a microburst often has high  that can knock over fully grown trees they usually last from a couple of seconds to several minutes

history of term 
the term was defined by  expert  as affecting an area 4km  2.5mi  in diameter or less distinguishing them as a type of  and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas fujita also coined the term macroburst for downbursts larger than 4km  2.5mi  a distinction can be made between a wet microburst which consists of  and a dry microburst which typically consists of  they generally are formed by precipitation-cooled air rushing to the surface but they perhaps also could be powered from the high speed winds of the  deflected toward the surface by a thunderstorm or by dynamical processes  see   microbursts are recognized as capable of generating wind speeds higher than 75  170  270  microbursts have also been called air bombs dry microbursts 




dry microburst schematic


when rain falls below the  or is mixed with dry air it begins to evaporate and this evaporation process cools the air the cool air descends and accelerates as it approaches the ground when the cool air approaches the ground it spreads out in all directions and this divergence of the wind is the signature of the microburst high winds spread out in this type of pattern showing little or no curvature are known as  dry microbursts produced by high based thunderstorms that generate little to no surface rainfall occur in environments characterized by a thermodynamic profile exhibiting an inverted-v at thermal and moisture profile as viewed on a  wakimoto  1985  developed a conceptual model  over the  of the united states  of a dry microburst environment that comprised three important variables  mid-level moisture a deep and dry adiabatic  in the sub-cloud layer and low surface  wet microbursts than their environment  wakimoto 1998  these downbursts rely more on the drag of precipitation for downward acceleration of  than negative buoyancy which tend to drive  dry  microbursts as a result higher  are necessary for these downbursts to form  hence the name  wet  microbursts  melting of ice particularly  appears to play an important role in downburst formation  wakimoto and bringi 1988  especially in the lowest 1km  0.62mi  above ground level  proctor 1989  these factors among others make  wet microbursts difficult 
development stages of microbursts 
the evolution of downbursts is broken down into three stages  the contact stage the outburst stage and the cushion stage 






a downburst initially develops as the downdraft begins its descent from the cloud base the downdraft accelerates and within minutes reaches the ground  contact stage  it is during the contact stage the highest winds are observed 








during the outburst stage the wind  curls  as the cold air of the downburst moves away from the point of impact with the ground 








during the cushion stage winds about the curl continue to accelerate while the winds at the surface slow due to friction 



when the two plates hit each other it forms a tornado and is very dangerous for a aircraft to land in this situation physical processes of dry and wet microbursts
start by using the  

by decomposing the variables into a basic state and a  defining the basic states and using the    then the equation can be written in the form

where b is  the  correction usually is rather small and to a good approximation  it can be ignored when computing buoyancy finally the effects of precipitation loading on the vertical motion are  by including a term that decreases buoyancy as the liquid water mixing ratio   increases leading to the final form of the parcel s momentum equation 

the first term is the effect of perturbation pressure gradients on vertical motion in some storms this term has a large effect on   rotunno and klemp 1982  but there is not much reason to believe it has much of an impact on   at least to a first approximation  and therefore will be ignored the second term is the effect of buoyancy on vertical motion clearly in the case of microbursts one expects to find that b is negative meaning the parcel is cooler than its environment this cooling typically takes place as a result of     and   precipitation particles that are small but are in great quantity promote a maximum contribution to cooling and hence to creation of negative buoyancy the major contribution to this process is from evaporation the last term is the effect of water loading whereas evaporation is promoted by large numbers of small droplets it only requires a few large  to contribute substantially to the downward acceleration of air parcels this term is associated with storms having high precipitation rates comparing the effects of water loading to those associated with buoyancy if a parcel has a liquid water mixing ratio of 1.0  1 this is roughly equivalent to about 0.3  of negative buoyancy  the latter is a large  but not extreme  value therefore in general terms negative buoyancy is typically the major contributor to downdrafts negative vertical motion associated only with buoyancy 
using pure  parcel theory  results in a prediction of the maximum downdraft of

where nape is the negative  
and where lfs denotes the level of free sink for a descending parcel and sfc denotes the surface this means that the maximum downward motion is associated with the  negative buoyancy even a relatively modest negative buoyancy can result in a substantial downdraft if it is maintained over a relatively large depth a downward speed of 25m s  56mph  90km h  results from the relatively modest nape value of 312.5 m2 s2 to a first approximation the maximum gust is roughly equal to the maximum downdraft speed danger to aircraft

the scale and suddenness of a microburst makes it a notorious danger to aircraft particularly those at low altitude which are  or  the following are some fatal crashes and or aircraft incidents that have been attributed to microbursts in the vicinity of airports

a microburst often causes aircraft to crash when they are attempting to land  the above-mentioned boac and pan am flights are notable exceptions  the microburst is an extremely powerful gust of air that once hitting the ground spreads in all directions as the aircraft is coming in to land the pilots try to slow the plane to an appropriate speed when the microburst hits the pilots will see a large spike in their airspeed caused by the force of the headwind created by the microburst a pilot inexperienced with microbursts would try to decrease the speed the plane would then travel through the microburst and fly into the tailwind causing a sudden decrease in the amount of air flowing across the wings the decrease in airflow over the wings of the aircraft causes a drop in the amount of lift produced this decrease in lift combined with a strong downward flow of air can cause the thrust required to remain at altitude to exceed what is available thus causing the aircraft to stall if the plane is at a low altitude shortly after takeoff or during landing it will not have sufficient altitude to recover the strongest microburst recorded thus far occurred at andrews field maryland on august 1st 1983 with wind speeds reaching 240.5 km h  149.5 mi h  danger to buildings
