preliminaries 
two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude in the first step the physical surface is modeled by the  a surface which approximates the  over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses the second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface the simplest choice for the reference surface is a  but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid the definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a  on the reference surface the latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface the correspondence being along the  to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface latitude and longitude together with some specification of  constitute a  as defined in the specification of the iso 19111 standard since there are many different  the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique  this is stressed in the iso standard which states that  without the full specification of the coordinate reference system coordinates  that is latitude and longitude  are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst  this is of great importance in accurate applications such as a   gps  but in common usage where high accuracy is not required the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated in english texts the latitude angle defined below is usually denoted by the greek lower-case letter    or   it is measured in   or  north or south of the equator the precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the earth either to set up  or to determine gps satellite orbits the study of the  together with its gravitational field is the science of  this article relates to coordinate systems for the earth  it may be extended to cover the moon planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature latitude on the sphere 




a perspective view of the earth showing how latitude   and longitude   are defined on a spherical model the graticule spacing is 10 degrees 

the graticule on the sphere 
the graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the earth the primary reference points are the  where the axis of rotation of the earth intersects the reference surface planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the   and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through greenwich  the   defines the longitude  meridians are lines of constant longitude the plane through the centre of the earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the  planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude  these are the parallels the equator has a latitude of 0 the  has a latitude of 90 north  written 90n or  90  and the  has a latitude of 90 south  written 90s or 90  the latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point  the normal to the surface of the sphere is along the radius vector the latitude as defined in this way for the sphere is often termed the spherical latitude to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article named latitudes on the earth 




the orientation of the earth at the december solstice 

besides the equator four other parallels are of significance 





the plane of the earth s orbit about the sun is called the  and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the earth is the equatorial plane the angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt the obliquity or the inclination of the ecliptic and it is conventionally denoted by i the latitude of the tropical circles is equal to i and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement  90  i  the axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current  the time variation is discussed more fully in the article on  the figure shows the geometry of a  of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the earth and the sun at the december  when the sun is overhead at some point of the  the south polar latitudes below the  are in daylight whilst the north polar latitudes above the arctic circle are in night the situation is reversed at the june solstice when the sun is overhead at the tropic of cancer only at latitudes in between the two  is it possible for the sun to be directly overhead  at the   on  there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear the examples below show the named parallels  as red lines  on the commonly used  and the  on the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical  both are complicated curves 
meridian distance on the sphere 
on the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude   is therefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned if the  is denoted by m  then



where r denotes the  of the earth r is equal to 6,371km or 3,959 miles no higher accuracy is appropriate for r since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model with this value for r the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is 111.2km or 69.1 miles the length of 1 minute of latitude is 1.853km or 1.151 miles and this distance was formerly used as the basis of the  latitude on the ellipsoid
in 1687  published the  in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an  ellipsoid  this article uses the term ellipsoid in preference to the older term spheroid  newton s result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century  see   an oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis  minor axis   oblate ellipsoid of revolution  is abbreviated to  ellipsoid  in the remainder of this article  ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial 
many different  have been used in the history of  in pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the  over the limited area of a survey but with the advent of  it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids  such as   with centre at the centre of mass of the earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the earth these geocentric ellipsoids are usually within 100m  330ft  of the geoid since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid  one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another gps handsets include software to carry out  which link wgs84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid the geometry of the ellipsoid 
the shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the  which is rotated about its minor  shorter  axis two parameters are required one is invariably the equatorial radius which is the  a the other parameter is usually  1 the polar radius or  b  or  2 the  first   f  or  3 the  e these parameters are not independent  they are related by



many other parameters  see    appear in the study of geodesy geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set a b f and e both f and e are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations  they are of the order 1 300 and 0.08 respectively values for a number of ellipsoids are given in  reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the inverse flattening 1 f for example the defining values for the  ellipsoid used by all gps devices are

a  equatorial radius  70066378137000000006378137.0m exactly
1 f  inverse flattening  7002298257223563000298.257223563 exactly

from which are derived

b  polar radius  70066356752314200006356752.3142m
e2  eccentricity squared  69976694379990140000.00669437999014

the difference between the semi-major and semi-minor axes is about 21km  13 miles  and as fraction of the semi-major axis it equals the flattening  on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300 by 299 pixels this would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel sphere so illustrations usually exaggerate the flattening geodetic and geocentric latitudes 




the definition of geodetic latitude   and longitude   on an ellipsoid the normal to the surface does not pass through the centre except at the equator and at the poles 

the graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere the normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre except for points on the equator or at the poles but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane the terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing 

geodetic latitude  the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane the standard notation in english publications is  this is the definition assumed when the word latitude is used without qualification the definition must be accompanied with a specification of the ellipsoid geocentric latitude  the angle between the radius  from centre to the point on the surface  and the equatorial plane  figure   there is no standard notation  examples from various texts include  q  c g this article uses  spherical latitude  the angle between the normal to a spherical reference surface and the equatorial plane geographic latitude must be used with care some authors use it as a synonym for geodetic latitude whilst others use it as an alternative to the  latitude  unqualified  should normally refer to the geodetic latitude 
the importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example on the reference ellipsoid for wgs84 the centre of the  has a geodetic latitude of 485129n or 48.8583n and longitude of 21740e or 2.2944e the same coordinates on the datum  define a point on the ground which is 140 metres  460 feet  distant from the tower  a web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower  the reference ellipsoid is rarely specified length of a degree of latitude 
main article  
in  and standard texts it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude  to the equator is given by   in radians 



where m  is the meridional  the distance from the equator to the pole is



for  this distance is 700710001965729000010001.965729km the evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection it can be evaluated by expanding the integral by the binomial series and integrating term by term  see  for details the length of the meridian arc between two given latitudes is given by replacing the limits of the integral by the latitudes concerned the length of a small meridian arc is given by




when the latitude difference is 1 degree corresponding to  180 radians the arc distance is about



the distance in metres  correct to 0.01 metre  between latitudes 0.5 degrees and  0.5 degrees on the wgs84 spheroid is



the variation of this distance with latitude  on   is shown in the table along with the   east-west distance 



a calculator for any latitude is provided by the u.s government s   nga  historically a  was defined as the length of one minute of arc along a meridian of a spherical earth an ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude this was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1,852 metres auxiliary latitudes 
there are six auxiliary latitudes that have applications to special problems in geodesy geophysics and the theory of map projections 

geocentric latitude
reduced  or parametric  latitude
rectifying latitude
authalic latitude
conformal latitude
isometric latitude

the definitions given in this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes like the geodetic latitude can be extended to define a three-dimensional  as discussed  the remaining latitudes are not used in this way  they are used only as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid their numerical values are not of interest for example no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the eiffel tower the expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude the semi-major axis a and the eccentricity e  for inverses see   the forms given are apart from notational variants those in the standard reference for map projections namely  map projections  a working manual  by j p snyder derivations of these expressions may be found in adams and online publications by osborne and rapp geocentric latitude 




the definition of geodetic  or geographic  and geocentric latitudes 

the geocentric latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the centre to a point on the surface the relation between the geocentric latitude   and the geodetic latitude   is derived in the above references as



the geodetic and geocentric latitudes are equal at the equator and at the poles but at other latitudes they differ by a few minutes of arc taking the value of the squared eccentricity as 0.0067  it depends on the choice of ellipsoid  the maximum difference of  may be shown to be about 11.5 minutes of arc at a geodetic latitude of approximately 456 reduced  or parametric  latitude 




definition of the reduced latitude   on the ellipsoid 

the reduced or parametric latitude  is defined by the radius drawn from the centre of the ellipsoid to that point q on the surrounding sphere  of radius a  which is the projection parallel to the earth s axis of a point p on the ellipsoid at latitude  it was introduced by legendre and bessel who solved problems for geodesics on the ellipsoid by transforming them to an equivalent problem for spherical geodesics by using this smaller latitude bessel s notation u  is also used in the current literature the reduced latitude is related to the geodetic latitude by 



the alternative name arises from the parameterization of the equation of the ellipse describing a meridian section in terms of cartesian coordinates p the distance from the minor axis and z the distance above the equatorial plane the equation of the  is 



the cartesian coordinates of the point are parameterized by



cayley suggested the term parametric latitude because of the form of these equations the reduced latitude is not used in the theory of map projections its most important application is in the theory of ellipsoid geodesics   karney  rectifying latitude 
see also  
the rectifying latitude  is the meridian distance scaled so that its value at the poles is equal to 90 degrees or  2 radians 



where the meridian distance from the equator to a latitude  is  see  



and the length of the meridian quadrant from the equator to the pole  the   is



using the rectifying latitude to define a latitude on a sphere of radius



defines a projection from the ellipsoid to the sphere such that all meridians have true length and uniform scale the sphere may then be projected to the plane with an  to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale an example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the   snyder section 16  the rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the  authalic latitude 
see also  
the authalic  greek for   latitude  gives an area-preserving transformation to a sphere 


where



and



and the radius of the sphere is taken as



an example of the use of the authalic latitude is the  14
conformal latitude 
the conformal latitude  gives an angle-preserving   transformation to the sphere 


where gd x  is the   see also   the conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere  so that the shape of small elements is well preserved  a further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane this is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection for example the  exact  version of the  on the ellipsoid is not a double projection  it does however involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane  isometric latitude 
the isometric latitude is conventionally denoted by   not to be confused with the geocentric latitude  it is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal  and the  the name  isometric  arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of  and longitude  give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively the  defined by the lines of constant  and constant  divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares  of varying size  the isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude tending to infinity at the poles the conventional notation is given in snyder  page 15 



for the normal mercator projection  on the ellipsoid  this function defines the spacing of the parallels  if the length of the equator on the projection is e  units of length or pixels  then the distance y of a parallel of latitude  from the equator is



the isometric latitude  is closely related to the conformal latitude  



inverse formulae and series 
the formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude the expressions for the geocentric and reduced latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases  the rectifying authalic conformal and isometric latitudes there are two methods of proceeding the first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude the methods available are  and  root finding the other more useful approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of  such series are presented by adams who uses taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity osborne derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package maxima and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening the series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step numerical comparison of auxiliary latitudes 
the following plot shows the magnitude of the difference between the geodetic latitude  denoted as the  common  latitude on the plot  and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude  which diverges to infinity at the poles  in every case the geodetic latitude is the greater the differences shown on the plot are in arc minutes the horizontal resolution of the plot fails to make clear that the maxima of the curves are not at 45 but calculation shows that they are within a few arc minutes of 45 some representative data points are given in the table following the plot note the closeness of the conformal and geocentric latitudes this was exploited in the days of hand calculators to expedite the construction of map projections 108









latitude and coordinate systems 
the geodetic latitude or any of the auxiliary latitudes defined on the reference ellipsoid constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional coordinate system on that ellipsoid to define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions three latitudes are used in this way  the geodetic geocentric and reduced latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively geodetic coordinates 




geodetic coordinates ph 


at an arbitrary point p consider the line pn which is normal to the reference ellipsoid the geodetic coordinates ph  are the latitude and longitude of the point n on the ellipsoid and the distance pn this height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location the direction of pn will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line the relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the earth spherical polar coordinates 




geocentric coordinate related to spherical polar coordinates p r 


the geocentric latitude  is the complement of the polar angle  in conventional  in which the coordinates of a point are p r  where r is the distance of p from the centre o  is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and  is longitude since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points on the normal which all have the same geodetic latitude will have differing geocentric latitudes spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field ellipsoidal coordinates 




ellipsoidal coordinates p u 


the reduced latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system for a point p not on the reference ellipsoid  semi-axes oa and ob  construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal  same foci f f  with the reference ellipsoid  the necessary condition is that the product ae of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids let u be the semi-minor axis  od  of the auxiliary ellipsoid further let  be the reduced latitude of p on the auxiliary ellipsoid the set  u  define the ellipsoid coordinates 4.2.2 these coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a uniform distribution of mass bounded by the reference ellipsoid coordinate conversions 
the relations between the above coordinate systems and also cartesian coordinates are not presented here the transformation between geodetic and cartesian coordinates may be found in  the relation of cartesian and spherical polars is given in  the relation of cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in torge astronomical latitude 
astronomical latitude   is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true  at a point on the surface the true vertical the direction of a  is also the direction of the gravity acceleration the resultant of the   mass-based  and the  at that latitude astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the  and stars whose  is accurately known in general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid the angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy the reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is because the geoid is an idealized theoretical shape  at mean sea level  points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly also the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces which the theoretical geoid averages out astronomical latitude is not to be confused with  the coordinate  use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north south of the   see   nor with  the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north south of the   see   see also
