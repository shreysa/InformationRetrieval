discovery 
after the  weather watchers tracked and mapped the effects on the sky over several years they labelled the phenomenon the  equatorial smoke stream  in the 1920s a japanese meteorologist  detected the jet stream from a site near  he tracked  also known as pibals  balloons used to determine upper level winds  as they rose into the atmosphere oishi s work largely went unnoticed outside japan because it was published in  american pilot  the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933 is often given some credit for discovery of jet streams post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above 6,200 metres  20,300ft  in the year before his death post made several attempts at a high-altitude transcontinental flight and noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed german meteorologist  is credited with coining a special term strahlstrmung  literally   current  for the phenomenon in 1939  modern german usage is  strahlstrom   many sources credit real understanding of the nature of jet streams to regular and repeated flight-path traversals during  flyers consistently noticed westerly tailwinds in excess of 100mph  160km h  in flights for example from the us to the uk similarly in 1944 a team of american meteorologists in guam including  had enough observations to forecast very high west winds that would slow bombers going to japan description 




general configuration of the polar and subtropical jet streams






cross section of the subtropical and polar jet streams by latitude


polar jet streams are typically located near the 250   about 1 4 atmosphere  pressure level or 7 to 12 kilometres  4.3 to 7.5mi  above  while the weaker subtropical jet streams are much higher between 10 and 16 kilometres  6.2 and 9.9mi  jet streams wander laterally dramatically and have large changes in their altitude the jet streams form near breaks in the tropopause at the transitions between the  and whose circulation with the coriolis force acting on those masses drives the jet streams the polar jets at lower altitude and often intruding into mid-latitudes strongly affects weather and aviation the polar jet stream is most commonly found between latitudes 30 and 60  closer to 60  while the subtropical jet streams are located close to latitude 30 the northern polar jet stream is said to  follow the sun  as it slowly migrates northward as that hemisphere warms and southward again as it cools the width of a jet stream is typically a few hundred kilometres or miles and its vertical thickness often less than five kilometres  3.1 miles

jet streams are typically continuous over long distances but discontinuities are common the path of the jet typically has a meandering shape and these meanders themselves propagate eastward at lower speeds than that of the actual wind within the flow each large meander or wave within the jet stream is known as a   planetary wave  rossby waves are caused by changes in the  with latitude   are smaller scale waves superimposed on the rossby waves with a scale of 1,000to 4,000 kilometres  6202,490mi  long that move along through the flow pattern around large scale or longwave  ridges  and  troughs  within rossby waves jet streams can split into two when it encounters an upper-level low that diverts a portion of the jet stream under its base while the remainder of the jet moves by to its north the wind speeds are greatest where temperature differences   between air masses are greatest and often exceed 92km h  50kn  57mph  to over 398km h  215kn  247mph  have been measured the jet stream moves from west to east bringing changes of weather meteorologists now understand that the path of jet streams affects  storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere and so knowledge of their course has become an important part of weather forecasting for example in 2007 and 2012 britain experienced severe flooding as a result of the polar jet staying south for the summer the polar and subtropical jets merge at some locations and times while at other times they are well separated cause

in general winds are strongest immediately under the   except locally during   or other anomalous situations  if two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet the resulting pressure difference caused by the density difference  which ultimately causes wind  is highest within the transition zone the wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area but is deflected by the  and flows along the boundary of the two air masses all these facts are consequences of the  relation the balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on the mass of the parcel and the buoyancy force or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction  upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force the balance in the vertical direction is referred to as  beyond the tropics the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction and the primary struggle is between the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force balance between these two forces is referred to as  given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance one can derive the thermal wind relation  the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient if two air masses one cold and dense to the north and the other hot and less dense to the south are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass the coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the east while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west the general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction as a result winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude therefore the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the equator is warmer than the north and south poles polar jet stream 
the thermal wind relation does not explain why the winds are organized into tight jets rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere one factor that contributes to the creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front this causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude at high altitudes lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole this results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong coriolis deflection and thus can be considered  quasi-geostrophic  the polar front jet stream is closely linked to the  process in midlatitudes as the acceleration deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low high pressure respectively which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region subtropical jet 
a second factor which contributes to a concentrated jet that is more applicable to the subtropical jet which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical  and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude tropical air rises to the tropopause and moves poleward before sinking  this is the hadley cell circulation as it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum since friction with the ground is significant air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the   true for either hemisphere  which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds  note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere  other planets 
 s atmosphere has multiple jet streams caused by the convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure  on jupiter these convection cells are driven by internal heating the factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology in models as one increases the planetary radius holding all other parameters fixed the number of jet streams decreases some effects

on earth the northern polar jet stream is the most important one for aviation and weather forecasting as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the  while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles  and sometimes the southern tip of  the term jet stream in these contexts thus usually implies the northern polar jet stream aviation 




flights between  and  using the jet stream eastbound and a  route westbound 

the location of the jet stream is extremely important for aviation commercial use of the jet stream began on 18 november 1952 when  flew from tokyo to honolulu at an altitude of 7,600 metres  24,900ft  it cut the trip time by over one-third from 18 to 11.5 hours not only does it cut time off the flight it also nets fuel savings for the airline industry within north america the time needed to fly east across the  can be decreased by about 30  if an  can fly with the jet stream or increased by more than that amount if it must fly west against it associated with jet streams is a phenomenon known as   cat  caused by vertical and horizontal  caused by jet streams the cat is strongest on the cold  side of the jet next to and just under the axis of the jet clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents such as the death of one passenger on  possible future power generation

scientists are investigating ways to harness the wind energy within the jet stream according to one estimate of the potential wind energy in the jet stream only 1 percent would be needed to meet the world s current energy needs the required technology would reportedly take 1020 years to develop there are two major but divergent scientific articles about jet stream power archer   caldeira claim that the earth s jet streams could generate a total power of 1700  and that the climatic impact of harnessing this amount would be negligible however miller gans   kleidon claim that the jet streams could generate a total power of only 7.5 tw and that the climatic impact would be catastrophic unpowered aerial attack

impact of el nio and la nia on north america


main article  
  enso  influences the average location of upper-level jet streams and leads to cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature across north america as well as affecting  development across the eastern pacific and atlantic basins combined with the  enso can also impact cold season rainfall in europe changes in enso also change the location of the jet stream over south america which partially affects precipitation distribution over the continent el nio 
during  events increased precipitation is expected in california due to a more southerly zonal storm track during the nio portion of enso increased precipitation falls along the gulf coast and southeast due to a stronger than normal and more southerly polar jet stream snowfall is greater than average across the southern rockies and sierra nevada mountain range and is well below normal across the upper midwest and great lakes states the northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter while the gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season the subtropical jet stream across the deep  of the  is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial pacific which decreases  within the atlantic tropics below what is normal and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern pacific in the southern hemisphere the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward or north of its normal position which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent la nia 
across north america during  increased precipitation is diverted into the  due to a more northerly storm track and jet stream the storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions  in the form of increased snowfall  to the midwestern states as well as hot and dry summers snowfall is above normal across the pacific northwest and western great lakes across the north atlantic the jet stream is stronger than normal which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards europe dust bowl 
evidence suggests the jet stream was at least partly responsible for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s  in the midwest united states normally the jet stream flows east over the  and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping  onto the  during the dust bowl the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal this starved the great plains and other areas of the midwest of rainfall causing extraordinary drought conditions longer-term climatic changes 
climate scientists have hypothesized that the jet stream will gradually weaken as a result of  trends such as  reduced snow cover  patterns and other weather anomalies are expected to make the arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe this in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course since 2007 and particularly in 2012 and early 2013 the jet stream has been at an abnormally low latitude across the uk lying closer to the  around 50n rather than its more usual north of scotland latitude of around 60n  however between 1979 and 2001 it has been found that the average position of the jet stream has been moving northward at a rate of 2.01 kilometres  1.25mi  per year across the  across north america this type of change could lead to drier conditions across the southern tier of the united states and more frequent and more intense  in the tropics a similar slow poleward drift was found when studying the  jet stream over the same time frame other upper-level jets

the polar-night jet stream forms only during the winter months when the nights are much longer hence  in their respective hemispheres at around 60 latitude the polar night jet moves at a greater height of about 80,000 feet  24,000m  than it does during the summer during these dark months the air high over the poles becomes much colder than the air over the equator this difference in temperature gives rise to extreme air pressure differences in the stratosphere which when combined with the coriolis effect create the polar night jets that race eastward at an altitude of about 30 miles  48km  the  is circled by the polar night jet the warmer air can only move along the edge of the polar vortex but not enter it within the vortex the cold polar air becomes increasingly cold with neither warmer air from lower latitudes nor energy from the sun during the  low level jets 
there are wind maxima at lower levels of the atmosphere that are also referred to as jets barrier jet 
a barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains the mountain barrier increases the strength of the low level wind by 45 percent in the north american  a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season normally in the form of  which form during the overnight hours a similar phenomenon develops across australia which pulls moisture poleward from the  towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the  valley exit jet 
a  is a strong down-valley elevated air current that emerges above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain these winds frequently reach a maximum of 20m s  45mph or 72km h  at a height of 40200 m above the ground surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation but are significantly weaker they are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal mountain wind systems such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the us deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases africa
