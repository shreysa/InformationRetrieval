the humboldt current system  hcs  also called the peru current is a major eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem that flows north along the western coast of south america it is an  flowing in the direction of the  and extend 500-1,000 kilometers offshore the humboldt current is named after the    in 1846 von humboldt reported measurements of the cold-water current in his book cosmos the current extends from the southern   45s  to northern   4s  where cold upwelled waters intersect warm tropical waters to form the equatorial front sea surface temperatures off the coast of peru around 5s reach temperatures as low as 16c this is highly uncharacteristic of tropical waters as most other regions have temperatures measuring above 25c upwelling brings nutrients to the surface which support phytoplankton and ultimately increase biological productivity  within the current is not uniform across the entire system three notable upwelling subsystems are produced by this current  i  seasonal upwelling in chile ii  upwelling shadow that is less productive but still large in northern chile and southern peru and iii  year-round upwelling in peru the humboldt current is considered a class i highly productive  300 gc m2-yr  ecosystem it is the most productive eastern boundary current system it accounts for roughly 18-20 of the total worldwide marine fish catch the species are mostly     and  the systems high productivity supports other important fishery resources as well as marine mammals   and   and  the cold nutrient-rich water brought to the surface by upwelling drives the systems extraordinary productivity 



 is in the southern outskirts of the  one of the driest places on earth it may come as a surprise to see cloud formations result of the humboldt current 

periodically the upwelling that drives the systems productivity is disrupted by the   enso  event when this occurs fish abundance and distribution are significantly affected often leading to stock crashes and cascading social and economic impacts these events have led to sequential changes where sardines and anchovies have replaced each other periodically as the dominant species in the ecosystem these species changes can have negative consequences for the fishing industry and the economies of the countries that fish the system the humboldt has a considerable cooling influence on the   and  it is also largely responsible for the aridity of  in  and coastal areas of peru and also of the aridity of southern ecuador marine air is cooled by the current and thus is not conducive to generating precipitation  although clouds and fog are produced

physical oceanography 
the  are the primary drivers of the humboldt current circulation variability in this system is driven by latitudinal shifts between the intertropical convergent zone and the trade winds in the north shifts within the south pacific high at mid-latitudes as well as cyclonic storms and movement of the southern  southward also contribute to system changes atmospheric variability off central chile is enhanced by the aggravation of coastal low pressure systems trapped between the marine boundary layer and the coastal mountains this is prominent poleward from 27s to 42s the humboldt current occupying the upper ocean flows equatorward carrying fresh cold sub-antarctic surface water northward along the outskirts of the  the main flow of the current veers offshore in southern peru as a weaker limb continues to flow equatorward around 18s the fresh cold waters begin to mix with the warm high salinity subtropical surface waters this collision causes partial  within this region the   euc  flows eastward along the equator feeding the   pcu  that moves poleward off the coast of central chile there is a coastal transition zone  ctz  which is characterized by high eddy kinetic energy this energy forms mesoscale eddies which extend 600800km offshore the ctz has three distinct regions within its boundaries  1  high chlorophyll-a concentrations in wide regions off the coast of peru  10-15s  2  high chlorophyll-a concentrations in wide regions off the coast of chile  30s  and 3  high chlorophyll-a concentrations in narrow regions off the coast of northern chile  montecino and lange 2008  high chlorophyll-a concentrations are generally found within 50km of the coast the limb of the hcs that veers off the coast of peru creates a decrease in ventilation within the system this lack of ventilation is the primary driver of an intense   omz  which is formed in the sub-surface to intermediate depths in the north the euc ventilates the omz and in the south the pcu  low oxygen waters southward towards northern chile this omz is the fourth largest permeant hypoxic zone in the worlds oceans it occupies an area about 2.18   0.66 x 106 km3 the core of this zone is centered off peru creating a shallow upper boundary that reaches from about 100 m down to 600 m another factor contributing to the omz is sinking and decay of primary productive resources consequently the omz forces many organisms to stay near the surface where nutrients and oxygen are obtainable the presence of a shallow omz restricts the migration of  within the water column between 0 and 600 m many species of zooplankton occupy this space within the omz this allows for a substantial exchange of carbon between the euphotic layer and the omz 75 of the total zooplankton biomass move in and out of the omz the omz also serves as a refuge for organisms that can live in  conditions coastal upwelling is the main factor contributing to the high biological productivity of the humboldt current upwelling within the current is not uniform across the entire system three notable upwelling subsystems are produced by this current  i  seasonal upwelling in chile only during the spring and summer because of the displacement of the subtropical center of high pressure during the winter  januarymarch  ii  upwelling shadow that is less productive but still large in northern chile and southern peru and iii  highly productive year-round upwelling in peru the upwelling shadow identified between 35s and 15s is caused by the oligotrophic subtropical gyre impinging on the coast this creates a narrow but highly productive upwelling zone biological productivity 
due to the upwelling zones within the humboldt current biological diversity is extremely high the current hosts a wide range of organisms including multiple species of     fish and marine mammals the food web starts with the phytoplankton the conditions of the humboldt current are prime for these organisms to thrive this causes a cascade effect in which larger and larger organisms are drawn to the area fisheries 
the humboldt current produces some of the most successful commercial fisheries in the world the major catches include  sardines anchovies mackerel hake and squid three major stocks of anchoveta are distributed between 4s and 42s within the hcs north-central perus fishery is primarily composed of one stock of anchoveta sardines chub mackerel and bonito are also common catches but not as prominent in peru southern peru and northern chile host a major sardine fishery other common stocks include  a second anchoveta stock jack mackerel tuna and swordfish anchoveta jack mackerel and sardines are the primary commercial stocks in central chile anchoveta are found in more recently upwelled waters close to the coast sardines on the other hand are typically found farther offshore seasonal upwelling plays a major role in the spawning behaviors of both sardines and anchoveta by spawning at the end of winter egg and larval survival in greatly enhanced this is due to the moderate upwelling which causes lower turbulence as well as a weakened ekman drift offshore these two species experience population shifts related to climate changes and environmental events such as el nino this is due to changes in the availability of each species habitat anchoveta are an important component in the diets of marine mammals seabirds and larger fish shifts in these populations ultimately cause a shift in the energy processing within the hcs jack mackerel  jurel  is the second largest fishery in the hcs as with the anchoveta in peru this species is believed to be composed of a single stock jurel are a straddling species this means the species is found both within and outside of the 200-mile economic exclusive zone jurel became an important fishery in the 1970s to alleviate the pressure put on the anchoveta stock during the 1980s however the jurel decreased in population size due to poor recruitment and overfishing restrictions of jurel fishing were imposed in 1998 which led to regrowth of the population since 2002 the jurel population is now under full exploitation during the last 15 years the hake fishery in peru has declined significantly this is due to overfishing environmental stress and decreased reproductive capacity the chilean hake population in central-south chile catch exceeded 100,000 tons and has since dropped to 40,000 tons in 2007 influence of el nio 
the productivity of the hcs is strongly effected by el nio and la nia events during an el nio event the thermocline and upper region of the omz deepen to greater than 600 m this causes a loss of nitrogen and decrease in export of carbon el nio also causes poleward currents to increase in velocity during non-el nio years productivity is very high due to the high nutrient contents nitrogen recycling through processes such as denitrification increased carbon export and remineralization 
the anchoveta fishery in peru was booming during the 1960s in 1970 catches were reported to exceed 12 million tons per year this accounted for 20 of the worlds catches an el nio event occurred during 1972 and caused the anchoveta population to collapse however sardine populations saw a dramatic increase in the next 1520 years consequently sardine fisheries grew in this regime shift see also
