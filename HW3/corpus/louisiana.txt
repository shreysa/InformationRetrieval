the gulf of mexico did not exist 250 million years ago when there was but one supercontinent  as pangea split apart the atlantic ocean and gulf of mexico opened louisiana slowly developed over millions of years from water into land and from north to south the oldest rocks are exposed in the north in areas such as the kisatchie national forest the oldest rocks date back to the early  some 60 million years ago the history of the formation of these rocks can be found in d spearing s roadside geology of louisiana the youngest parts of the state were formed during the last 12,000 years as successive deltas of the mississippi river  the maringouin teche st bernard lafourche the modern mississippi and now the atchafalaya the sediments were carried from north to south by the mississippi river in between the tertiary rocks of the north and the relatively new sediments along the coast is a vast belt known as the  terraces their age and distribution can be largely related to the rise and fall of sea levels during past ice ages in general the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep channels while the newer terraces tend to be much flatter  are also found in louisiana their origin can be traced back to the early gulf of mexico when the shallow ocean had high rates of evaporation there are several hundred salt domes in the state  one of the most familiar is avery island salt domes are important not only as a source of salt  they also serve as underground traps for oil and gas geography

louisiana is bordered to the west by   to the north by   to the east by the state of   and to the south by the  the surface of the state may properly be divided into two parts the uplands of the north and the  along the coast the alluvial region includes low swamp lands coastal marshlands and beaches and  that cover about 20,000 square miles  52,000km2  this area lies principally along the  and the  which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about 600 miles  1,000km  and empties into the   the   the  and its branches  and other minor streams  some of which are called   the breadth of the alluvial region along the mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles  15 to 100km  and along the other rivers the alluvial region averages about 10 miles  15km  across the mississippi river flows along a ridge formed by its own natural deposits  known as a   from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile  3m km  the alluvial lands along other streams present similar features the higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than 25,000 square miles  65,000km2  they consist of prairie and woodlands the elevations above sea level range from 10 feet  3m  at the coast and swamp lands to 50 and 60 feet  1518m  at the prairie and alluvial lands in the uplands and hills the elevations rise to  the highest point in the state at only 535 feet  163m  above sea level from years 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 sq miles due to rises in sea level and  the  spends around  1 billion per year to help shore up and protect louisiana  and land in both federal and state funding besides the waterways already named there are the  forming the western boundary  and the  the eastern boundary  the    the  the   the    the     the courtableau river bayou d arbonne the macon river the     the    the  the natalbany river and a number of other smaller streams constituting a natural system of navigable waterways aggregating over 4,000 miles  6,400km  long the state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately 3-mile  4.8kmwide portion of  land of the  in the  through a peculiarity of the  of the  this is substantially less than the 9-mile  14kmwide jurisdiction of nearby   and  which like louisiana have extensive gulf coastlines the southern coast of louisiana in the united states is among the fastest-disappearing areas in the world this has largely resulted from human mismanagement of the coast  see   at one time the land was added to when spring floods from the mississippi river added sediment and stimulated marsh growth  the land is now shrinking there are multiple causes artificial levees block spring flood water that would bring fresh water and sediment to marshes swamps have been extensively logged leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland where it damages swamps and marshes rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day there are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage including restoring natural floods from the mississippi without such restoration coastal communities will continue to disappear and as the communities disappear more and more people are leaving the region since the coastal  support an economically important coastal fishery the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry climate

when news of the purchase reached the united states jefferson was surprised he had authorized the expenditure of  10 million for a port city and instead received treaties committing the government to spend  15 million on a land package which would double the size of the country jefferson s political opponents in the  argued the louisiana purchase was a worthless desert and that the constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or negotiating treaties without the consent of the senate what really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the louisiana territory strengthening western and southern interests in congress and further reducing the influence of new england federalists in national affairs president jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion and held firm in his support for the treaty despite federalist objections the u.s senate ratified the louisiana treaty on october 20 1803 by statute enacted on october 31 1803 president thomas jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by france and provide for initial governance a transfer ceremony was held in new orleans on november 29 1803 since the louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the french the spanish took down their flag and the french raised theirs the following day  accepted possession of new orleans for the united states a similar ceremony was held in  on march 9 1804 when a french tricolor was raised near the river replacing the spanish national flag the following day   of the first u.s artillery marched his troops into town and had the american flag run up the fort s flagpole the louisiana territory was officially transferred to the united states government represented by  the louisiana territory purchased for less than 3 cents an acre doubled the size of the united states overnight without a war or the loss of a single american life and set a precedent for the purchase of territory it opened the way for the eventual expansion of the united states across the continent to the pacific shortly after the united states took possession the area was divided into two territories along the  on march 26 1804 thereby organizing the  to the south and the   subsequently formed as the   to the north statehood  1812

following the civil war and emancipation of slaves violence rose in the south as the war was carried on by insurgent private and paramilitary groups initially state legislatures were dominated by former confederates who passed black codes to regulate  and generally refused to give the vote they refused to extend voting rights to african americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property  as in new orleans  following the  and the  the same year the fourteenth amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen congress passed the reconstruction act establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst including louisiana it was grouped with  in what was administered as the  african americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law both  and  who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education family stability and jobs at the same time there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market white  mobilized to enforce  first in  chapters by 1877 when federal forces were withdrawn white democrats in louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures often by paramilitary groups such as the  which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence following mississippi s example in 1890 in 1898 the white democratic planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively  blacks and people of color by raising barriers to voter registration such as  residency requirements and  the effect was immediate and long lasting in 1896 there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters in proportion to the state population which was evenly divided the state population in 1900 was 47 african-american  a total of 652,013 citizens many in new orleans were descendants of creoles of color the sizeable population of  before the civil war by 1900 two years after the new constitution only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state because of disfranchisement by 1910 there were only 730 black voters  less than 0.5 percent of eligible african-american men  despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries white democrats had established one-party democratic rule which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after congressional passage of the 1965  provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote in the early decades of the 20th century thousands of african americans left louisiana in the  north to industrial cities for jobs and education and to escape jim crow society and  the  infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs the mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers beginning in the 1940s blacks went west to california for jobs in its expanding defense industries during some of the  louisiana was led by governor  he was elected to office on populist appeal his public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need and he supported education and increased suffrage for poor whites but long was criticized for his allegedly demogogic and autocratic style he extended patronage control through every branch of louisiana s state government especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state long s rule ended abruptly when the governor was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935 post-world war ii  1945

dishes typical of  

louisiana is home to many especially notable are the distinct culture of the  typically people of color descendants of free mixed-race families of the colonial and early statehood periods african culture 
the french colony of la louisiane struggled for decades to survive conditions were harsh the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew and they suffered from regional tropical diseases both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates the settlers kept importing slaves which resulted in a high proportion of native africans from west africa who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings as described by historian  they developed a marked afro-creole culture in the colonial era at the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s new orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the  many of whom brought their slaves with them this added another infusion of african culture to the city as more slaves in  were from africa than in the united states they strongly influenced the african-american culture of the city in terms of dance music and religious practices louisiana creole culture 
 culture is an amalgamation of french african spanish  and other european  and native american cultures creole comes from the portuguese word crioulo  originally it referred to a colonist of european  specifically french  descent who was born in the new world in comparison to immigrants from france the oldest louisiana manuscript to use the word  creole  from 1782 applied it to a slave born in the french colony but originally it referred more generally to the french colonists born in louisiana over time there developed in the french colony a relatively large group of   gens de couleur libres  who were primarily descended from african slave women and french men  later other europeans became part of the mix as well as some native americans  often the french would free their concubines and  children and pass on social capital to them they might educate sons in france for instance and help them enter the french army for a career they also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children the free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education  they generally spoke french and were roman catholic many became artisans and property owners over time the term  creole  became associated with this class of  many of whom achieved freedom long before the civil war wealthy french creoles generally maintained town houses in  as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the mississippi river new orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region  they could find work there and created their own culture marrying among themselves for decades acadian culture 
the ancestors of  immigrated from west central france to new france where they settled in the atlantic provinces of  and  known originally as  after the british defeated france in the    in 1763 france ceded its territory east of the mississippi river to britain the british forcibly separated families and evicted them from acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new british regime the acadians were deported to england new england and france some escaped the british remained in french canada others scattered to france canada mexico or the falkland islands many acadian refugees settled in south louisiana in the region around  and the lafourche bayou country they developed a distinct rural culture there that was different from that of the french creole colonists in the new orleans area intermarrying with others in the area they developed what was called cajun music cuisine and culture until the 1970s the term  cajun  was considered somewhat derogatory isleo culture 
a third distinct culture in louisiana is that of the  descendants of spanish  who migrated from the canary islands of spain under the spanish crown beginning in the mid-1770s they developed four main communities but many relocated to what is modern-day  this is where the majority of the isleo population is still concentrated an annual festival called fiesta celebrates the heritage of the isleos st bernard parish has an isleos museum cemetery and church as well as many street names with spanish words and spanish surnames from this heritage some members of the isleo community still speak spanish  with their own canary islander accent numerous isleo identity organizations and many members of isleos society keep contact with the canary islands of spain languages 




the languages of historic native american tribes that occupied what is now louisiana include  tunica caddo natchez choctaw atakapa chitimacha and houma
