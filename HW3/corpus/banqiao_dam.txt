approximate location of banqiao dam


construction of the banqiao dam began in april 1951 on the ru river with the help of soviet consultants as part of a project to control  and provide  the construction was a response to severe flooding in the  basin in 1949 and 1950 the dam was completed in june 1952 because of the absence of hydrology data the design standard was lower than usual after the 1954  great flood the upstream reservoirs including banqiao were extended constructed and consolidated banqiao dam was increased in height by three meters the dam crest level was 116.34 meters above sea level and the crest level of the wave protection wall was 117.64 meters above sea level the total capacity of the reservoir was 492 million m3  398,000acre feet  with 375 million m3  304,000acre feet  reserved for  storage the dam was made of  and was 24.5 meters high the maximum discharge of the reservoir was 1742 m3 s cracks in the  and  appeared after completion due to construction and engineering errors they were repaired with the advice from  engineers and the new design dubbed the iron dam was considered unbreakable    one of china s foremost  was involved in the design of the dam he was also a vocal critic of the government s dam building policy which involved many dams in the basin he had recommended 12 sluice gates for the banqiao dam but this was criticized as being too conservative and the number was reduced to five other dams in the project including the shimantan dam had a similar reduction of safety features and chen was removed from the project in 1961 after problems with the water system were revealed he was brought back to help chen continued to be an outspoken critic of the system and was again removed from the project 1975 banqiao dam flood 




rough diagram of waterflow during the banqiao dam failure


officially the dam failure was a natural as opposed to man-made disaster with government sources placing an emphasis on the amount of rainfall as opposed to poor engineering and construction the  has maintained that the dam was designed to survive a once-in-1000-years flood  300mm of rainfall per day  but a once-in-2000-years flood occurred in august 1975 following the collision of  and a  the typhoon was blocked for two days before its direction ultimately changed from northeastward to westward as a result of this near stationary thunderstorm system more than a year s worth of rain fell within 24 hours  new records were set at 189.5mm  7.46 inches  rainfall per hour and 1060mm  41.73 inches  per day exceeding the average annual precipitation of about 800mm  31.5 inches  which weather forecasts failed to predict  reported that the typhoon disappeared from radar as it degraded according to  the forecast was for rainfall of 100mm by the beijing-based central meteorological observatory communication with the dam was largely lost due to wire failures on august 6 a request to open the dam was rejected because of the existing flooding in downstream areas on august 7 the request was accepted but the  failed to reach the dam the sluice gates were not able to handle the overflow of water partially due to  blockage on august 7 at 21 30 the  unit 34450  by name the 2nd artillery division in residence at  county  which was deployed on the banqiao dam sent the first dam failure warning via telegraph on august 8 at 1 00 water at the banqiao crested at the 117.94 m level above sea level or 0.3 meter higher than the wave protection wall on the dam and it failed the same storm caused the failure of 62 dams in total the runoff of banqiao dam was 13,000 m3 per second in vs 78,800 m3 per second out and as a result 701 million m3 of water were released in 6 hours while 1.67 billion m3 of water were released in 5.5 hours at an upriver shimantan dam and 15.738 billion m3 of water were released in total the resulting flood waters caused a wave 10 kilometers  6.2mi  wide and 37 meters  9.823.0ft  high in    that rushed onto the plains below at nearly 50 kilometers per hour  31mph  almost wiping out an area 55 kilometers  34mi  long and 15 kilometers  9.3mi  wide and creating temporary lakes as large as 12,000 square kilometers  4,600sqmi  seven county seats suiping                and    were inundated as were thousands of square kilometers of countryside and countless communities evacuation orders had not been fully delivered due to weather conditions and poor communications telegraphs failed signal flares fired by unit 34450 were misunderstood telephones were rare and some messengers were caught by the flood while only 827 out of 6,000 people died in the evacuated community of shahedian just below banqiao dam half of a total of 36,000 people died in the unevacuated wencheng commune of suipin county next to shahedian and the daowencheng commune was wiped from the map killing all 9,600 citizens although a large number of people were reported as lost at first many of them later returned home a 2005 book compiled by the archives bureau of suiping county reports that more than 230,000 were carried away by water in which 18,869 died it has been reported that 90,000  230,000 people were killed as a result of the dam breaking to protect other dams from failure several  were evacuated and inundated and several dams were deliberately destroyed by air strikes to release water in desired directions the nihewa and laowangpo flood diversion areas downstream of the dams soon exceeded their capacity and gave up part of their storage on august 8 forcing more flood diversion areas to begin to evacuate the dikes on the  collapsed in the evening of august 9 and the entire linquan county in  was inundated as the boshan dam with a capacity of 400 million m3 crested and the water released from the failures of banqiao and shimantan was rushing downstream air strikes were made against several other dams to protect the  dam already holding 1.2 billion m3 of water suya lake won only a temporary reprieve as both it and boshan became eventual targets finally the  holding 5.7 billion m3 of water was bombed the  a major artery from  to  was cut for 18 days as were other crucial communications lines although 42,618  troops were deployed for disaster relief all communication to and from the cities was cut nine days later there were still over a million people trapped by the waters who relied on  of food and were unreachable by disaster relief workers epidemics and famine devastated the trapped survivors the damage of the  area was estimated to be about cn3.5 billion  513 million  the zhumadian government appealed to the whole nation for help and received more than cn300 million  us 44,000,000  in donations after the flood a summit of national flood prevention and reservoir security at zhengzhou henan was held by the department of water conservancy and electricity and a nationwide reservoir security examination was performed chen xing was again brought back to the project casualties 
according to the hydrology department of henan province approximately 26,000 people died in the province from  and another 145,000 died during subsequent  and  in addition about 5,960,000 buildings collapsed and 11 million residents were affected unofficial estimates of the number of people killed by the disaster have run as high as 230,000 people the death toll of this disaster was  in 2005 reconstruction 
within eleven years of the dam failure the lower reach of the river ru esp  city experienced several more disastrous floods after many feasibility studies the new banqiao reservoir reconstruction was listed as a key national project of  the project owner was  the construction contractor was  by the end of 1986 the rebuilding project commenced on june 5 1993 the project was certified by the chinese government the reconstructed banqiao reservoir controls a catchment area of 768km2  297sqmi  the maximum reserve capacity is 675millionm3  178billiongallons  a capacity increase of 34 above the capacity of the failed dam the effective storage is 256millionm3  67.6billiongallons  and the corresponding normal high water level is 111.5m  366ft  above sea level the flood control storage is 457millionm3  121billiongallons  the dam is made of  and is 3,720m  12,200ft  long and 50.5m  166ft  high the dam crest level is 120m  390ft  above sea level the maximum discharge of the reservoir is 15000m3 s  about 3.96milliongallons s  legacy 
after the disaster of the banqiao dam failure the chinese government became very focused on surveillance repair and consolidation of reservoir dams china has 87,000 reservoirs across the country  most of which were built in the 1950s1970s using low construction standards most of these reservoirs are in serious disrepair posing challenges to the prevention and control of flood-triggered geological disasters in areas with a population of 130 million or more china s medium and small rivers are considered to be the  in the country s river control systems according to statistics from the  china has invested cn64.9 billion  us 9.72 billion  since the  in repairing and consolidating the country s 9,197 degraded reservoirs of which 2,397 are large or medium-sized and 6,800 are key small reservoirs see also
