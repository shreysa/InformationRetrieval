seasonal forecasts 

 are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts philip j klotzbach  and their associates at   and separately by  forecasters klotzbach s team  formerly led by gray  defined the average number of storms per season  1950 to 2000  as 9.6tropical storms 5.9hurricanes 2.3major hurricanes  storms reaching at least category3 strength in the   and ace index 96.1  defines a season as above-normal near-normal or below-normal by a combination of the number of named storms the number reaching hurricane strength the number reaching major hurricane strength and  pre-season forecasts 
on december10 2008 klotzbach s team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2009season predicting above-average activity  14named storms 7hurricanes 3of category3 or higher and  of 125  on april7 2009 klotzbach s team issued an updated forecast for the 2009season predicting near-average activity  12named storms 6hurricanes 2of category3 or higher and  of 100  citing the possible cause as the high probability of a weak  forming during the season on may21 2009  issued their forecast for the season predicting near or slightly above average activity  9 to 14named storms 4 to 7hurricanes and 1 to 3of category3 or higher  midseason outlooks 
on june2 2009 klotzbach s team issued another updated forecast for the 2009 season predicting slightly below average activity  11 named storms 5hurricanes 2 of category3 or higher and  of 85  also on june2 2009 the florida state university center for ocean-atmospheric prediction studies  fsu coaps  issued its first ever atlantic hurricane season forecast the fsu coaps forecast predicted 8 named storms including 4 hurricanes and an  of 65 on june18 2009 the uk    issued a forecast of 6tropical storms in the july to november period with a 70 chance that the number would be in the range3 to 9 they also predicted an  of 60 with a 70%chance that the index would be in the range40 to 80 on august4 2009 klotzbach s team updated their forecast for the 2009 season again predicting slightly below average activity  10 named storms 4hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes  on august6 2009 the noaa also updated their forecast for the 2009 season predicting below average activity  711 named storms 36 hurricanes and 12 major hurricanes  season summary

during the 2009 season nine of the eleven tropical cyclones affected land of which five actually made landfall the united states experienced one of its quietest years with no hurricanes making landfall in the country throughout the basin six people were killed in tropical cyclone-related incidents and total losses reached roughly  77million most of the damage resulted from hurricane bill which caused severe beach erosion throughout the east coast of the united states in the united states tropical cyclones killed six people and caused roughly  50million in damage in the lesser antilles tropical storms ana and erika brought moderate rainfall to several islands but resulted in little damage elsewhere in the atlantic the azores islands atlantic canada bermuda cape verde islands and wales were affected by tropical cyclones or their remnants in canada hurricane bill produced widespread moderate rainfall in nova scotia and newfoundland leaving roughly  10million in losses the hurricane also produced tropical storm-force winds in bermuda hurricane fred briefly impacted the southern cape verde islands as it bypassed the islands early in its existence the azores and wales were also affected by tropical storm grace  however both areas recorded only minor effects overall the season s activity was reflected with a low cumulative   ace  rating of 53 the lowest since  due to the low number of storms in the 2009 season many of which were short-lived the overall ace value was ranked as below-average totaling under 66 hurricane bill was responsible for the ace value for august being 30 above average ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34  39mph 63km h  or tropical storm strength  are excluded from the total systems

tropical storm ana 

main article  
ana formed out of an  associated with a  on august11 ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on august12 before weakening back to a depression the following day the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward on august14 the depression regenerated roughly 1,075mi  1,735km  east of the  early on august15 the storm re-attained tropical storm status at which time it was named ana after reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40mph  65km h  and a  of 1003mbar  hpa  29.65inhg  the storm began to weaken again due to increasing wind shear and the unusually fast movement of ana in post-storm analysis it was discovered that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on august16 before reaching any landmasses numerous  were issued for the lesser antilles puerto rico and the  between august15 and 17 several islands took minor precautions for the storm including  which evacuated 40residents from flood-prone areas ahead of the storm in the dominican republic officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters impact from ana was minimal mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall in puerto rico up to 2.76in  70mm  causing street flooding and forcing the evacuation of three schools high winds associated with the storm also downed trees and power lines leaving roughly 6,000 residents without power 
hurricane bill 

main article  
as ana regenerated into a tropical depression a new tropical depression developed early on august15 southwest of the cape verde islands light wind shear and warm waters allowed the depression to steadily intensify becoming  later that day by august17 bill attained hurricane-status about midway between the cape verde islands and the lesser antilles eventually the hurricane attained its peak intensity as a  roughly 345mi  555km  east-northeast of the leeward islands the storm attained maximum winds of 130mph  215km h  the highest of any storm during the season before weakening slightly as it turned north the large storm passed roughly 175mi  280km  west of  as a category2 hurricane further weakening took place as bill brushed the southern coast of  the following day shortly before making landfall in  bill weakened to a tropical storm and accelerated the storm eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after moving over the north atlantic before being absorbed by a larger non-tropical low on august24 two people were killed by the storm s large swellsone in  and another in  the hurricane came close enough to warrant  in both the us and canada bill was one of three tropical storms active on august16 large life-threatening swells produced by the storm impacted north-facing coastlines of  and  as hurricane bill approached bermuda along the coasts of north carolina waves averaging 10ft  3.0m  in height impacted beaches on  beach damage was severe  in some areas the damage was worse than  in 1985 in  severe  caused by the storm resulted in over  35.5million in losses 
tropical storm claudette 

main article  
just one day after the formation of hurricane bill the season s third named storm developed on august16 forming out of a  and an upper-level  claudette quickly intensified into a tropical storm offshore south of  by the afternoon the storm had attained winds of 60mph  95km h  and steadily tracked towards the florida panhandle early on august17 the center of claudette made  on  several hours after landfall the storm weakened to a tropical depression and the  took over primary responsibility of the storm the system quickly dissipated and was last noted over  on august18 the  issued tropical storm warnings for the florida coastline and residents in some counties were advised to evacuateprone areas tropical storm claudette produced moderate rainfall across portions of florida georgia and alabama between august16 and 18 two people were killed offshore amidst rough seas from the storm an  spawned by the storm in  damaged 11 homes leaving  103,000 in damages additional damages to coastal property and beaches amounted to  125,000 as a result of claudette 
tropical storm danny 

main article  
around the same time the remnants of hurricane bill dissipated over the northern atlantic a new tropical storm developed near the  on august26 the system immediately declared  on its first advisory erratically moved in a general northwestward direction danny attained peak winds of 60mph  95km h  before succumbing to high wind shear after turning northward the storm weakened and was eventually absorbed by another low pressure system off the east coast of the united states early on august29 high waves from danny killed a boy in the  
tropical storm erika 

main article  
on september1 the season s fifth named storm  formed east of the lesser antilles upon forming the storm had attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph  85km h  persistent wind shear prevented the system from intensifying and resulted in the storm s convection being completely displaced from the center of circulation by the time it passed over  on september2 after entering the caribbean sea erika briefly regained strength before fully succumbing to strong shear the system eventually dissipated on september4 to the south of puerto rico damages were minor though one island received several inches of rain 
hurricane fred 

main article  
several days after erika dissipated a new tropical depression formed southeast of the cape verde islands on september7 this depression  within an environment of low wind shear and high  receiving the name  on september8 the storm quickly developed an  and was upgraded to a hurricane roughly 24hours after being named within a 12hour span the storm s winds increased by 40mph  65km h  to its peak of 120mph  195km h  upon reaching this intensity fred became the strongest storm on record south of 30n and east of 35w in the atlantic basin not long after the intensification ceased it began to weaken as dry air became entrained within the system by september11 the storm nearly stalled northwest of the cape verde islands and weakened to a tropical storm the following day fred degenerated into a remnant low before taking a westward track across the atlantic the remnants of fred persisted for nearly a week nearly regenerating into a tropical depression several times the low eventually dissipated on september19 to the south of bermuda 
tropical depression eight 

in late september a new well-defined tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa into the atlantic ocean by september25 the system had developed sufficient deep convection for the nhc to classify it as tropical depression eight at this time the depression attained its peak intensity with winds of 35mph  55km h  and a minimum pressure of 1008mbar  hpa  shortly thereafter wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused the depression to weaken the system degenerated into a remnant low on september26 before degenerating into a  of low pressure 
tropical storm grace 

main article  
originating from an extratropical cyclone east of newfoundland on september27 the precursor to  tracked southeastward towards the azores gaining subtropical characteristics after executing a counterclockwise loop between october1 and 3 deep convection wrapped around a small circulation center that had developed within the larger cyclone on october4 this smaller low developed into a tropical storm while situated near the azores islands becoming the northeastern-most forming atlantic tropical cyclone on record the storm quickly turned northeastward and intensified developing an eye-like feature as it attained peak winds of 65mph  100km h  and a minimum pressure of 986mbar  hpa  29.11inhg  it weakened over increasingly colder waters and began merging with an approaching frontal boundary early on october6 grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating later that day near  although grace passed through the azores islands the storm had little known effects there in europe the system and its remnants brought rain to several countries including portugal the united kingdom and belgium no fatalities were linked to grace and overall damage was minimal 
tropical storm henri 

a tropical wave left the coast of africa on october1 moving westward with intermittent showers and thunderstorms on october 5 the system became better organized and a  formed although the thunderstorms were displaced east of the  and the probability for development was never high the disturbance became a tropical depression around 0000 utc on october 6 about 775mi  1,247km  east of the  operationally the storm was not designated a tropical cyclone until later on october6 when it was immediately declared a tropical storm affected by strong wind shear henri remained disorganized with its center located on the western edge of the convection moving northwestward henri intensified slightly to peak winds of 50mph  85km h  on october7 after the convection increased shortly thereafter the wind shear grew stronger and on october8 the storm weakened to a tropical depression the structure became further disorganized with several low-level vortices just twelve hours after weakening into a depression henri degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure the remnants continued northwestward before turning to the west-southwest due to a ridge on october11 the storm s circulation dissipated near  having never impacted land 
hurricane ida

the final storm of the 2009 season formed over the southern caribbean sea on november4 the slow moving system quickly developed into  within a favorable environment as it neared the coastline of  several hours before moving over land ida attained hurricane-status with winds reaching 80mph  130km h  hours after moving inland ida weakened to a tropical storm and further to a tropical depression as it turned northward on november7 the depression re-entered the caribbean sea and quickly intensified early on november8 the system re-attained hurricane intensity as it rapidly intensified over warm waters ida attained its peak intensity as a category2 hurricane early the next day with winds of 105mph  165km h  as it moved over the  not long after reaching this intensity ida quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the gulf of mexico despite strong wind shear the storm briefly re-attained hurricane status for a third time near the southeastern  coastline before quickly weakening to a tropical storm shortly before moving inland over the southern united states ida transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the remnants of ida persisted until november11 at which time the low dissipated remnant energy from ida provided energy for another system which became a powerful  causing significant damage in the  the resulting storm came to be known as  in the southern caribbean hurricane ida caused roughly  2.1million in damage in nicaragua after destroying numerous homes and leaving an estimated 40,000 people homeless ida also produced significant rainfall across portions of western cuba with some areas recording up to 12.5in  320mm  of rain during the storm s passage in the united states the hurricane and the subsequent nor easter caused substantial damage mainly in the mid-atlantic states one person was killed by ida after drowning in rough seas while six others were killed in various incidents related to the nor easter overall the two systems caused nearly  300million in damage throughout the country 
storm names 
the following names were used for named storms in the north atlantic in 2009 names that were not used are marked in gray this is the same list used in the  with the exception of fred ida and joaquin which replaced   and  respectively the names fred and ida were used for atlantic storms for the first time in 2009 as the name joaquin was not used during the course of this season there were no names retired this year  thus the same list was used again in the  
season effects 
this is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2009 atlantic hurricane season it includes their duration names landfall s   denoted by bold location names  damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect  an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident  but were still related to that storm damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical a wave or a low and all of the damage figures are in 2009 usd
