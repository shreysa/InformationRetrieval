a tropical depression formed from a  near  on september 7 it strengthened rapidly  by the time position fixes could be taken nancy was nearly a super typhoon moving gradually westward nancy explosively deepened and reached wind speeds equivalent to a category5   on september 9 it would maintain that intensity for the next several days shortly after reaching peak intensity nancy approached the  and began turning it passed near  and over  the  steering nancy broke down and the typhoon turned sharply and headed towards japan nancy made landfall as a strong typhoon on september 16 as it passed directly over  nancy made a second landfall on  near  the  rapidly traveled up the length of the island as it continued accelerating eventually reaching a forward speed of 65mph  100km h 55  the typhoon quickly crossed over  before entering the  as a tropical storm nancy went  on september 17 the extratropical system eventually crossed over  and entered the open ocean impact 
although no monetary value of all damage is known damage was  phenomenal  in all areas where nancy hit there were at least 173 deaths and 19 people unaccounted for guam 
on  over half of all crops were destroyed by heavy winds and rain a total of  40,000  1961   worth of damage was done to roads on the island most of the damage was on the southern end of the island no deaths were reported on guam japan 
in japan 172 people were killed 18 were missing and 3,184 people were injured these totals made nancy the sixth-deadliest typhoon to hit japan at the time timely warnings and adequate preparations were probably responsible for the relatively low death toll the damage was  small  relative to other typhoons that impacted densely populated areas of japan hundreds of thousands of people had their lives disrupted super typhoon nancy destroyed 11,539 houses damaged 32,604 homes and flooded 280,078 others although the exact number may never be known the  reported in late september that over 1,056 ships and fishing vessels were sunk or blown ashore and many more were damaged floodwaters washed away 566  and caused 1146  roads were destroyed at a total of 2,053 locations damages in  amounted to  500million  1961usd  on  low-lying areas experienced heavy flooding which did significant damage to agriculture and structures on  one person was missing and another was badly injured a ship was sunk extensive flooding of crops and houses left 152 people homeless due to nancy s damage and death toll the  named nancy the  second  typhoon  nancy is one of only eight typhoons to receive special names in japan records 
a reconnaissance aircraft flying into the typhoon near its peak intensity on september 12 determined nancy s one-minute sustained winds to be 185knots  215mph  345km h  if these values are reliable they would be the highest wind speeds ever measured in a tropical cyclone however it was later determined that measurements and estimations of wind speeds from the 1940s to 1960s were excessive thus nancy s winds may actually be lower than its official best-track value in 2016 reanalysis of  noted that the storm had 215mph  345km h  sustained winds which ties nancy and is the highest sustained winds in the  although the   sshws  didn t exist at the time nancy would have been a category5 equivalent for a total of five and a half days  or 132 hours  assuming the windspeed data is reliable this is a record for the  and more than a day longer than the next-highest system 1962 s  see also
