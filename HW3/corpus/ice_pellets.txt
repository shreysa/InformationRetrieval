ice pellets are a form of  consisting of small  balls of ice ice pellets are smaller than  which form in  rather than in winter and are different from   soft hail  which is made of frosty white  and from  which is a  liquid or semisolid ice pellets often bounce when they hit the ground or other solid objects and make a higher-pitched  tap  when striking objects like   and  compared to the dull splat of liquid raindrops pellets generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with  the  code for ice pellets is pl  pe before november 1998

terminology 
ice pellets are known to americans as sleet the official term used by the u.s  however the term sleet refers to a  in most commonwealth countries including  because of this  never uses the term sleet and uses the terms  ice pellets  or  wet snow  instead formation 




temperature profile for ice pellet formation 

ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air is located between 1,500 and 3,000 meters  5,000 and 10,000  above the ground with sub-freezing air both above and below it this causes the partial or complete melting of any  falling through the warm layer  the french term for sleet neige fondue literally means  melted snow  because of this  as they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface they re-freeze into ice pellets however if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze before hitting the surface so it will become  a temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a  during the cold season but can occasionally be found behind a passing  and often with a

effects 
in most parts of the world ice pellets only occur for brief periods and do not accumulate a significant amount however across the eastern  and southeastern  warm air flowing north from the  ahead of a strong  storm system can overrun cold dense air at the surface for many hundreds of miles for an extended period of time in these areas ice pellet accumulations of 25 cm  0.82.0 in  are not unheard of the effects of a significant accumulation of ice pellets are not unlike an accumulation of snow one significant difference is that for the same volume of snow an equal volume of ice pellets is significantly heavier and thus more difficult to clear away additionally a volume of ice pellets takes significantly longer to melt compared to an equal volume of fresh snowfall see also
