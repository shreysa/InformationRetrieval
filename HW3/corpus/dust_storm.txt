a dust storm is a  common in  and  regions dust storms arise when a  or other strong wind blows loose sand and  from a dry surface fine particles are transported by  and suspension a process that moves soil from one place and  it in another  around  and the  are the main terrestrial sources of airborne dust also with some contributions from   and  into the  and  significant storms deposit dust in the  poor management of the  s drylands such as neglecting the  system are increasing dust storms size and frequency from desert margins and changing both the local and global climate and also impacting local economies the term sandstorm is used most often in the context of  sandstorms especially in the  or places where sand is a more prevalent soil type than dirt or rock when in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility a considerable amount of larger sand particles are blown closer to the surface the term dust storm is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances especially when the dust storm affects

causes 
as the force of wind passing over loosely held particles increases particles of sand first start to vibrate then to   leaps  as they repeatedly strike the ground they loosen and break off smaller particles of dust which then begin to travel in suspension at wind speeds above that which causes the smallest to suspend there will be a population of dust grains moving by a range of mechanisms  suspension saltation and

a study from 2008 finds that the initial saltation of sand particles induces a static electric field by friction saltating sand acquires a negative charge relative to the ground which in turn loosens more sand particles which then begin saltating this process has been found to double the number of particles predicted by previous theories particles become loosely held mainly due to drought or arid conditions and varied wind causes gust fronts may be produced by the outflow of rain-cooled air from an intense thunderstorm or the wind gusts may be produced by a dry  that is a cold front that is moving into a dry air mass and is producing no the type of dust storm which was common during the  years in the u.s following the passage of a dry cold front  instability resulting from cooler air riding over heated ground can maintain the dust storm initiated at the front in desert areas dust and sand storms are most commonly caused by either thunderstorm outflows or by strong pressure gradients which cause an increase in wind velocity over a wide area the vertical extent of the dust or sand that is raised is largely determined by the stability of the atmosphere above the ground as well as by the weight of the particulates in some cases dust and sand may be confined to a relatively shallow layer by a low-lying  in other instances dust  but not sand  may be lifted as high as 20,000feet  6,100m  high  and  contribute to the emergence of dust storms as do poor  and grazing practices by exposing the dust and sand to the wind one poor farming practice which contributes to dust storms is  particularly poor dryland farming techniques are  or not having established  or  when storms strike at particularly vulnerable times prior to  in a semi-arid climate these practices increase susceptibility to dust storms however  practices may be implemented to control wind erosion

a sandstorm can transport and carry large volumes of sand unexpectedly dust storms can carry large amounts of dust with the leading edge being composed of a wall of thick dust as much as 1.6km  0.99mi  high dust and sand storms which come off the  are locally known as a  or simoon  smm smn  the   hbb  is a sandstorm prevalent in the region of  around  with occurrences being most common in the summer the  desert is a key source of dust storms particularly the  and an area covering the confluence of   and  saharan dust storms have increased approximately 10-fold during the half-century since the 1950s causing topsoil loss in   northern  and  in mauritania there were just two dust storms a year in the early 1960s but there are about 80 a year today according to andrew goudie a professor of geography at oxford university levels of saharan dust coming off the east coast of africa in june 2007 were five times those observed in june 2006 and were the highest observed since at least 1999 which may have cooled atlantic waters enough to slightly reduce hurricane activity in late 2007 dust storms have also been shown to increase the spread of disease across the globe virus spores in the ground are blown into the atmosphere by the storms with the minute particles and interact with urban air pollution short-term effects of exposure to desert dust include immediate increased  and worsening of the  in individuals with  increased  and  from long-transported dust from both saharan and asian dust storms suggesting that long-transported dust storm particles adversely affects the circulatory system  is the result of large amounts of dust being inhaled prolonged and unprotected exposure of the  in a dust storm can also cause  which if left untreated will lead to   silicosis is an incurable condition that may also lead to  there is also the danger of   dry eyes  which in severe cases without immediate and proper treatment can lead to  dust storms cause soil loss from the dry lands and worse they preferentially remove organic matter and the nutrient-rich lightest particles thereby reducing agricultural productivity also the abrasive effect of the storm damages young crop plants dust storms also reduced visibility affecting aircraft and road transportation in addition dust storms also create problems due to complications of breathing in dust dust can also have beneficial effects where it deposits  central and south american rain forests get most of their mineral nutrients from the sahara  iron-poor ocean regions get iron  and dust in hawaii increases  growth in northern china as well as the mid-western u.s ancient dust storm deposits known as  are highly fertile soils but they are also a significant source of contemporary dust storms when soil-securing vegetation is disturbed

further information  
dust storms are not limited to earth and have been known to form on other planets such as  these dust storms can extend over larger areas than those on earth sometimes encircling the planet with wind speeds as high as 60 miles per hour  97km h  however given mars  much lower atmospheric pressure  roughly 1 that of earth s  the intensity of mars  storms could never reach the kind of hurricane-force winds experienced on earth martian dust storms are formed when solar heating warms the martian atmosphere and causes the air to move lifting dust off the ground the chance for storms is increased when there are great temperature variations like those seen at the equator during the martian summer see also
