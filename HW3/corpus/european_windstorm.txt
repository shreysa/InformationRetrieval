conceptual model for a european windstorm and the associated strong wind  footprints  note that storm track footprint locations and footprint sizes vary by case and that all footprints are not always present 

european windstorm is a name given to the strongest  which occur across the continent of  they form as   associated with areas of low  they are most common in the autumn and winter months on average the month when most windstorms form is january the seasonal average is 4.6 windstorms deep low pressure areas are relatively common over the north atlantic sometimes starting as  off the  coast and frequently track across the north atlantic ocean towards western europe past the north coast of  and  and into the  however when they track further south they can affect almost any country in europe commonly affected countries include the   the   the  and  but any country in   and especially  is occasionally struck by such a storm system the strong wind phenomena intrinsic to european windstorms that give rise to  damage footprints  at the surface can be placed into three categories namely the  warm jet  the  cold jet  and the  sting jet  these phenomena vary in terms of physical mechanisms atmospheric structure spatial extent duration severity level predictability and location relative to cyclone and fronts on average these storms cause economic damage 1.9billion per year and insurance losses of 1.4billion per year  19901998  they rank as the second highest cause of global natural catastrophe insurance loss  after u.s

nomenclature
up to the second half of the 19th century european windstorms were named after the person who spotted them  usually they would be named either by the year the date the saint s day of their occurrence or any other way that made them commonly known however a storm may still be named differently in different countries for instance the norwegian weather service also names independently notable storms that affect  which can result in multiple names being used in different countries they affect such as 

1999 storm   in germany is known as the  decemberorkan  or  adam  in denmark and as  carola  in sweden 2011 storm   in norway and sweden is known as  patrick  in germany and  tapani  in finland 2013  in the english media is known as christian in german and french  following the free university of berlin s adopt-a-vortex program  it was named simone by the  and as the october storm in danish and dutch it was later given the name allan by the  following the political decision to name strong storms which affect denmark 
an alternative scottish naming system arose in 2011 via social media twitter which resulted in the humorous naming of  and hurricane fannybaws such usage of the term hurricane is not without precedent as the  was referred to as  hurricane low q  uk and ireland

2015 list of storm names from uk  and 


the uk  and irish forecasting service  held discussions about developing a common naming system for atlantic storms in 2015 a pilot project by the two forecasters was launched as  name our storms  which sought public participation in naming large-scale cyclonic windstorms affecting the uk and or ireland over the winter of 2015 16 an independent forecaster the european windstorm centre also has its own naming list although this is not an official list germany

during 1954 karla wege a student at the free university of berlin s meteorological institute suggested that names should be assigned to all areas of low and high pressure that influenced the weather of central europe the university subsequently started to name every area of high or low pressure within its weather forecasts from a list of 260 male and 260 female names submitted by its students the female names were assigned to areas of low pressure while male names were assigned to areas of high pressure the names were subsequently exclusively used by berlin s media until february 1990 after which the german media started to commonly use the names however they were not officially approved by the german meteorological service  the dwd subsequently banned the usage of the names by their offices during july 1991 after complaints had poured in about the naming system however the order was leaked to the german press agency  who ran it as its lead weather story germany s zdf television channel subsequently ran a phone in poll on 17 july 1991 and claimed that 72 of the 40,000 responses favored keeping the names this made the dwd pause and think about the naming system and these days the dwd accept the naming system and request that it is maintained during 1998 a debate started about if it was discrimination to name areas of high pressure with male names and the areas of low pressure with female names the issue was subsequently resolved by alternating male and female names each year in november 2002 the  adopt-a-vortex  scheme began which allows members of the public or companies to buy naming rights for a letter chosen by the buyer that are then assigned alphabetically to high and low pressure areas in europe during each year the naming comes with the slim chance that the system will be notable the money raised by this is used by the meteorology department to maintain weather observations at the free university name of phenomena 
several european languages use  of the word huracn  ouragan orkan huragan orkaan  which may or may not be differentiated from tropical hurricanes in these languages  to indicate particularly strong cyclonic winds occurring in europe the term hurricane as applied to these storms is not in reference to the structurally different  of the same name but to the hurricane strength of the wind on the   winds  118km h or  73mph  in english use of term hurricane to refer to european windstorms is mostly discouraged as these storms do not display the structure of tropical storms likewise the use of the french term ouragan is similarly discouraged as hurricane is in english as it is typically reserved for tropical storms only european windstorms in  are generally referred to by derivatives of tempestas  tempest tempte tempestado  meaning storm weather or season from the  tempus meaning time globally storms of this type forming between 30 and 60 latitude are known as extratropical cyclones the name european windstorm reflects that these storms in europe are primarily notable for their strong winds and associated damage which can span several nations on the continent the strongest cyclones are called windstorms within academia and the insurance industry the name european windstorm has not been adopted by the uk met office in broadcasts  though it is used in their academic research  the media or by the general public and appears to have gained currency in academic and insurance circles as a linguistic and terminologically neutral name for the phenomena in contrast to some other european nations there is a lack of a widely accepted name for these storms in english the met office and uk media generally refer to these storms as severe gales the current definition of severe gales  which warrants the issue of a weather warning  are repeated gusts of 70mph  110km h  or more over inland areas european windstorms are also described in forecasts variously as winter storms winter lows autumnal lows atlantic lows and cyclonic systems  they are also sometimes referred to as bullseye isobars and dartboard lows in reference to their appearance on weather charts  a  exhibition has used the name european cyclones with north-atlantic cyclone and north-atlantic windstorms also being used though with the advent of the  name our storms  project they are generally known as storms

the state of the  relates strongly to the frequency intensity and tracks of european windstorms an enhanced number of storms have been noted over the north atlantic european region during positive nao phases  compared to negative nao phases  and is due to larger areas of suitable growth conditions the occurrence of extreme north atlantic cyclones is aligned with the nao state during the cyclones  development phase the strongest storms are embedded within and form in large scale atmospheric flow it should be kept in mind that on the other hand the cyclones themselves play a major role in steering the nao phase aggregate european windstorm losses show a strong dependence on nao with losses increasing decreasing 10-15 at all return periods clustering 
temporal clustering of windstorm events has also been noted with 8 consecutive storms hitting europe during the winter of 1989 90  in 1999 were separated only by 36 hours kyrill in 2007 following only four days after hanno and 2008 with   and  in 2011  moved across northern europe and just a day later another storm named yoda hit the same area in december the same year    and   cato dagmar  struck northern europe economic impact
insurance losses from windstorms are the second greatest source of loss for any natural peril after  in the united states windstorm losses exceed those caused by flooding in europe for instance one windstorm  in 2007 exceeded the losses of the  on average some 200,000 buildings are damaged by high winds in the uk every year

recent storms 

 saw a  conveyor belt  series of high-precipitation storms  mostly unexceptional for their winds  explosively deepened by a strong jet stream the repeated formation of large deep lows over the atlantic brought storm surges and large waves which coincided with some of the highest astronomical tides of the year and led to coastal damage the low pressure areas brought heavy rainfalls and flooding which became most severe over parts of england such as at the somerset levels
