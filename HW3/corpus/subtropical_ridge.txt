the subtropical ridge starts migrating poleward in late spring reaching its zenith in early autumn before retreating equatorward during the late  winter and early spring the equatorward migration of the subtropical ridge during the cold season is due to increasing north-south temperature differences between the poles and tropics the latitudinal movement of the subtropical ridge is strongly correlated with the progression of the  or  most  form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the  then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the westerlies when the subtropical ridge shifts due to enso so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks areas west of  and  tend to experience many fewer septembernovember tropical cyclone impacts during  and neutral years while mainland  experiences much greater landfall frequency during  years during el nio years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near  which would favor the japanese archipelago while in la nia years the formation of tropical cyclones along with the subtropical ridge position shift west which increases the threat to china in the atlantic basin the subtropical ridge position tends to lie about 5degrees farther south during el nio years which leads to a more southerly recurvature for tropical cyclones during those years when the  s mode is favorable to   1995present  it amplifies the subtropical ridge across the central and eastern atlantic role in weather formation and air quality
