formation 
freezing drizzle is formed in low level  type  when vertical motion is weak it consists of relatively small drops light in nature freezing drizzle generally occurs when drizzle forms in an airmass at below freezing temperatures but warmer than10c  14f  at such a temperature the water droplets stay  as there are few  to change them to   see   in winter arctic conditions it can happen at even lower surface temperatures as the air is even cleaner effects 
when freezing drizzle accumulates on land it creates an icy layer of  freezing drizzle alone does not generally result in significant  accumulations due to its light low-intensity nature however even thin layers of slick ice deposited on roads as  can cause extremely hazardous conditions resulting in vehicle crashes see also
