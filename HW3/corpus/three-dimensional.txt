a representation of a three-dimensional  with the x-axis pointing towards the observer 


three-dimensional space  also  3-space or rarely tri-dimensional space  is a geometric setting in which three values  called   are required to determine the position of an element  i.e   this is the informal meaning of the term  in  and  a  of n  can be understood as a location in n-dimensional space when n   3 the set of all such locations is called three-dimensional  it is commonly represented by the symbol 3 this serves as a three-parameter model of the physical   that is the spatial part without considering time  in which all known  exists however this space is only one example of a large variety of spaces in three dimensions called  in this classical example when the three values refer to measurements in different directions   any three directions can be chosen provided that  in these directions do not all lie in the same    furthermore in this case these three values can be labeled by any combination of three chosen from the terms    and

in euclidean geometry
main article  
in mathematics   also called cartesian geometry  describes every point in three-dimensional space by means of three coordinates three  are given each perpendicular to the other two at the  the point at which they cross they are usually labeled x y and z relative to these axes the position of any point in three-dimensional space is given by an ordered triple of  each number giving the distance of that point from the  measured along the given axis which is equal to the distance of that point from the plane determined by the other two axes other popular methods of describing the location of a point in three-dimensional space include  and  though there are an infinite number of possible methods see  below are images of the above-mentioned systems 































lines and planes 
two distinct points always determine a  straight   three distinct points are either  or determine a unique plane four distinct points can either be collinear  or determine the entire space two distinct lines can either intersect be  or be  two parallel lines or  lie in a unique plane so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a common plane two distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel  do not meet  three distinct planes no pair of which are parallel can either meet in a common line meet in a unique common point or have no point in common in the last case the three lines of intersection of each pair of planes are mutually parallel a line can lie in a given plane intersect that plane in a unique point or be parallel to the plane in the last case there will be lines in the plane that are parallel to the given line a  is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension of the full space the hyperplanes of a three-dimensional space are the two-dimensional subspaces that is the planes in terms of cartesian coordinates the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single  so planes in this 3-space are described by linear equations a line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations each representing a plane having this line as a common intersection  states that the midpoints of any quadrilateral in 3 form a  and so are coplanar spheres and balls

a two-dimensional  of a sphere


a  in 3-space  also called a 2-sphere because it is a 2-dimensional object  consists of the set of all points in 3-space at a fixed distance r from a central point p the solid enclosed by the sphere is called a   or more precisely a 3-ball  the volume of the ball is given by

 
another type of sphere arises from a 4-ball whose three-dimensional surface is the 3-sphere  points equidistant to the origin of the euclidean space 4 if a point has coordinates p x y z w  then x2   y2   z2   w2   1 characterizes those points on the unit 3-sphere centered at the origin polytopes 
main article  
in three dimensions there are nine regular polytopes  the five convex  and the four nonconvex  
surfaces of revolution 
main article  
a  generated by revolving a plane  about a fixed line in its plane as an axis is called a  the plane curve is called the generatrix of the surface a section of the surface made by intersecting the surface with a plane that is perpendicular  orthogonal  to the axis is a circle simple examples occur when the generatrix is a line if the generatrix line intersects the axis line the surface of revolution is a right circular  with vertex  apex  the point of intersection however if the generatrix and axis are parallel the surface of revolution is a circular  quadric surfaces 
main article  
in analogy with the  the set of points whose cartesian coordinates satisfy the general equation of the second degree namely 


where a b c f g h j k l and m are real numbers and not all of a b c f g and h are zero is called a quadric surface there are six types of  quadric surfaces 








the degenerate quadric surfaces are the empty set a single point a single line a single plane a pair of planes or a quadratic cylinder  a surface consisting of a non-degenerate conic section in a plane  and all the lines of 3 through that conic that are normal to   elliptic cones are sometimes considered to be degenerate quadric surfaces as well both the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic paraboloid are  meaning that they can be made up from a family of straight lines in fact each has two families of generating lines the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects with just one exception every member of the other family each family is called a  in linear algebra 
another way of viewing three-dimensional space is found in  where the idea of independence is crucial space has three dimensions because the length of a  is independent of its width or breadth in the technical language of linear algebra space is three-dimensional because every point in space can be described by a linear combination of three independent  dot product angle and length 
main article  
a vector can be pictured as an arrow the vector s magnitude is its length and its direction is the direction the arrow points a vector in 3 can be represented by an ordered triple of real numbers these numbers are called the components of the vector the dot product of two vectors a    a1 a2 a3  and b    b1 b2 b3  is defined as 



the magnitude of a vector a is denoted by  a  the dot product of a vector a    a1 a2 a3  with itself is



which gives



the formula for the  of the vector without reference to the components of the vectors the dot product of two non-zero euclidean vectors a and b is given by



where  is the  between a and b cross product 
main article  
the  or vector product is a  on two  in three-dimensional  and is denoted by the symbol  the cross product a  b of the vectors a and b is a vector that is  to both and therefore  to the plane containing them it has many applications in mathematics  and  the space and product form an  which is neither  nor  but is a  with the cross product being the lie bracket one can in n dimensions take the product of n  1 vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them but if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results it exists only in three and  



the cross-product in respect to a right-handed coordinate system


in calculus 
main article  
gradient divergence and curl 
in a rectangular coordinate system the gradient is given by



the divergence of a   f   u i   v j   w k is equal to thevalued function 



expanded in   see  for  and  coordinate representations  the curl   f is for f composed of  fx fy fz 



where i j and k are the  for the x y and z-axes respectively this expands as follows 



line integrals surface integrals and volume integrals 
for some  f  u  rn  r the line integral along a   c  u is defined as



where r   a b   c is an arbitrary   of the curve c such that r a  and r b  give the endpoints of c and  for a  f  u  rn  rn the line integral along a   c  u in the direction of r is defined as



where  is the  and r   a b   c is a   of the curve c such that r a  and r b  give the endpoints of c a  is a generalization of  to integration over  it can be thought of as the  analog of the  to find an explicit formula for the surface integral we need to  the surface of interest s by considering a system of  on s like the  on a  let such a parameterization be x s t  where  s t  varies in some region t in the  then the surface integral is given by



where the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the  of the  of the  of x s t  and is known as the surface  given a vector field v on s that is a function that assigns to each x in s a vector v x  the surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field  the result is a vector a  refers to an  over a 3 domain it can also mean a  within a region d in r3 of a   and is usually written as 



fundamental theorem of line integrals 
main article  
the  says that a  through a  field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve let  then



stokes  theorem 
main article  
 relates the  of the  of a  f over a surface  in euclidean three-space to the  of the vector field over its boundary  



divergence theorem 
main article  
suppose v is a subset of   in the case of n   3 v represents a volume in 3d space  which is  and has a   s  also indicated with v   s  if f is a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighborhood of v then the  says 

  

the left side is a  over the volume v the right side is the  over the boundary of the volume v the closed manifold v is quite generally the boundary of v oriented by outward-pointing  and n is the outward pointing unit normal field of the boundary v  ds may be used as a shorthand for nds 
in topology 
three-dimensional space has a number of topological properties that distinguish it from spaces of other dimension numbers for example at least three dimensions are required to tie a  in a piece of string with the space  the topologists locally model all other  see also
