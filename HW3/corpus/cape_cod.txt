the cape and islands


like cape cod itself the islands south of the cape have evolved from whaling and trading areas to become resort destinations attracting wealthy families celebrities and other tourists these include the large nearby islands of  and  which have grown in population by 6.8 percent and 10.3 percent respectively between 2000 and 2010 while the year-round population of barnstable county dropped 3 percent according to the census both islands are also famous summer tourist destinations commonly accessed by ferry from several locations on the cape the phrases cape cod and the islands and the cape and islands are often used to describe the whole region of barnstable county   including martha s vineyard and the smaller   and nantucket county several small islands right off cape cod including    and  are also in barnstable county theowned  was first purchased by  naushon is one of the elizabeth islands many of which are privately owned one of the publicly accessible elizabeths is the southernmost island in the chain  with a year-round population of 52 people several prominent families have established compounds or estates on the larger islands making these islands some of the wealthiest resorts in the northeast yet they retain much of the early merchant trading and whaling culture cape cod in particular is a popular retirement area  27.8 of the population of barnstable county is 65 years old or older and the average age of residents is the highest of any area in   by voter registration numbers  outnumber  by less in the three counties than in the whole of massachusetts to varying degrees the bulk of the land in the area is   and represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast new england  similar glacial formations make up long island in new york and  in rhode island

physical geography and boundaries 
the name  cape cod  as it was first used in 1602 applied only to the very tip of the peninsula it remained that way for 125 years until the  precinct of cape cod  was incorporated as the town of provincetown no longer in  official  use over the ensuing decades the name came to mean all of the land east of the manomet and scusset rivers  essentially along the line that became the cape cod canal the creation of the canal separated the majority of the peninsula from the mainland most agencies including the  and the   fema  treat the cape as an island with regard to disaster preparedness groundwater management and the like cape codders tend to refer to the land on the mainland side of the canal as  off-cape  though the legal delineation of cape cod coincident to the boundaries of barnstable county includes portions of the towns of bourne and sandwich that are located north of the canal  lies in between cape cod and the mainland  bounded on the north by a horizontal line between  and  north of cape cod bay  and provincetown  is  which contains the  located 5 miles  8km  north of provincetown the atlantic ocean is to the east of cape cod and to the southwest of the cape is  the cape cod canal completed in 1916 connects buzzards bay to cape cod bay  its creation shortened the trade route between new york and boston by 62 miles  100km  cape cod extends 65 miles  105km  into the atlantic ocean with a breadth of between 120 miles  1.632.2km  and covers more than 400 miles  640km  of shoreline its elevation ranges from 306 feet  93m  at its highest point at the top of  in the bourne portion of  down to sea level one of the biggest  in the world cape cod shields much of the massachusetts coastline from north atlantic storm waves this protection erodes the cape s shoreline at the expense of its cliffs while protecting towns from fairhaven to marshfield cape cod and the islands are part of a continuous  consisting of a thin line of islands stretching west to include long island this region is historically and collectively known by naturalists as the  towns and villages

for most of the 18th 19th and 20th centuries cape cod was considered to consist of three sections  see map 

the upper cape is the part of cape cod closest to the mainland comprising the towns of  sandwich falmouth and mashpee falmouth is the home of the famous  and  as well as several other research organizations and is also the most-used ferry connection to martha s vineyard falmouth is composed of several separate villages including      waquoit  and  as well as several smaller hamlets that are incorporated into their larger neighbors  e.g davisville hatchville falmouth heights quissett sippewissett and others   is home to the  in the village of  along the canal   the annual  in september and until 1884 was part of sandwich sandwich the oldest town on cape cod founded in 1637 is home to the  the historic   and the   is the home of the  tribe of native americans the mid-cape area includes the towns of barnstable yarmouth and dennis the area features many beautiful beaches including warm-water beaches along  e.g kalmus beach in hyannis which gets its name from one of the inventors of  herbert kalmus this popular windsurfing destination was bequeathed to the town of barnstable by dr kalmus on condition that it not be developed possibly one of the first instances of open-space preservation in the us the mid-cape is also the commercial and industrial center of the region there are seven villages in barnstable including       and  as well as several smaller hamlets that are incorporated into their larger neighbors  e.g    santuit wianno and others  the villages of yarmouth are   and  there are five villages in dennis including     and  the lower cape   outer cape traditionally includes all of the rest of the cape or the towns of        and  in the present day the five outermost towns  provincetown truro wellfleet eastham and orleans  are more commonly and collectively known as the  outer cape  this area is home to the  a national park that encompasses much of the outer cape including the entire east-facing coast from orleans to provincetown the outer cape is home to some of the most popular beaches in the united states such as nauset light beach and coast guard beach in eastham race point beach in provincetown ballston beach in truro and skaket beach in orleans the outer cape and the beaches in the area have become infamous for their summertime  sightings along with numerous other shark species in the summer of 2012 a tourist was attacked and bitten by a great white shark off ballston beach in truro the outer cape is the least populated area of cape cod though provincetown has a city-like atmosphere during the summer season provincetown has become a major gay   lesbian resort destination  the town is regarded as one of the largest  resort communities in the united states provincetown is also renowned for its historic fishing fleets and  a popular fishing ground and  destination is located a few miles north of race point 
 upper  and  lower 
the terms  upper cape  and  lower cape  and references to traveling  up cape  or  down cape  have long been a source of confusion for the uninitiated cape cod visitor who mistakenly associating  up  with  north  might get turned around by passages such as these from 1920 

 the look of things is more ocean-like if one goes down the cape to provincetown 
 almost every street in chatham is solidly paved and the old corner town of the cape is the natural goal of the traveler coming up the cape from provincetown 

there are many theories to explain the apparent paradox one is that the terms derive from early nautical navigation when one traveled to the east one went down the longitudinal scale  toward zero at  england  additionally prevailing fair weather winds  generally out of the southwest  have been used as the basis for directional descriptions by european settlers and their descendants in eastern north america that is one would be traveling  down   to the east with a westerly wind at one s back to this day on nearby martha s vineyard  up island  is the western section and  down island  is to the east the arrival of the railroad during the nineteenth century reinforced the  up down  concept as train schedules between boston and cape cod always showed boston at the top  the timetable for trains headed onto the cape would be read from the top down and those of returning trains would be read from the bottom up provincetown therefore despite being the cape s northernmost town was the furthest  down  that one could travel  the cape s unique shape brought a new paradox along with the automobile and highway system  when driving  down cape  on   eastbound  the final 30 miles from orleans to provincetown takes one in nearly every direction except east 
the best known colloquial explanation however is that the shape of the peninsula as it appears on maps and charts resembles that of a human arm in that analogy the southern portion of the cape represents the  upper arm  chatham the elbow and the north-south portion is the  lower arm  or forearm going further some say provincetown is the curled hand or fist with  and  at its knuckles and  at the fingertips in the late twentieth century as the cape began drawing more vacationers and artists on retreat the nautical nomenclature and potential confusion over directions have gradually been giving way to the simpler  outer cape  although the older terms are still used by some local residents geology

cape cod was formed by retreating glaciers






geologic makeup of cape cod


the bulk of the land on cape cod consists of  formed by  and  this represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast new england  similar glacial formations make up  in  and  in  together these formations are known as the  or more obscurely as the  isles of stirling  geologically speaking cape cod is quite young having been laid down some 16,000 to 20,000 years ago most of cape cod s geological history involves the advance and retreat of the  in the late  geological era and the subsequent changes in sea level using  techniques researchers have determined that around 23,000 years ago the ice sheet reached its maximum southward advance over north america and then started to retreat many   clear cold lakes  were formed and remain on cape cod as a result of the receding glacier by about 18,000 years ago the ice sheet had retreated past cape cod by roughly 15,000 years ago it had retreated past southern new england when so much of earth s water was locked up in massive ice sheets the sea level was lower truro s bayside beaches used to be a petrified forest before it became a beach

as the ice began to melt the sea began to rise initially sea level rose quickly about 15 metres  49ft  per 1,000 years but then the rate declined on cape cod sea level rose roughly 3 metres  9.8ft  per millennium between 6,000 and 2,000 years ago after that it continued to rise at about 1 metre  3.3ft  per millennium by 6,000 years ago the sea level was high enough to start eroding the glacial deposits that the vanished continental ice sheet had left on cape cod the water transported the eroded deposits north and south along the outer cape s shoreline through a process known as  those reworked sediments that moved north went to the tip of cape cod the entire town of provincetown at the extreme tip of the cape is a  consisting largely of deposited marine sediment that was eroded and transported from farther south along the shore those sediments that instead moved south created the islands and shoals of monomoy so while other parts of the cape have dwindled from the action of the waves these parts of the cape have grown through the  of sediment in just the last 6,000 years this process continues today due to their exposure to the open ocean the cape and islands are subject to considerable  geologists say that due to erosion the cape will be completely submerged by the sea within several thousand years this erosion causes the washout of beaches and the destruction of the barrier islands  for example the ocean broke through the barrier island at chatham during  in 1991 allowing waves and storm surges to hit the coast with no obstruction consequently the sediment and sand from the beaches is being washed away and deposited elsewhere while this destroys land in some places it creates land elsewhere most noticeably in marshes where sediment is deposited by flowing water cape cod s aquifer consists of six hydrologically independent  from which all the towns on the cape obtain drinking water  except falmouth which got 43.5 of its 2015 water from long pond  contamination with industrial chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs from septic systems is a concern 



view of cape cod from the 


climate 
although cape cod s weather is typically more moderate than inland locations on occasion it takes the brunt of extreme weather systems such as the  and  because of the influence of the atlantic ocean temperatures are typically a few degrees lower in the summer and a few degrees higher in the winter than the adjacent mainland a common misconception is that the climate is influenced largely by the warm  current  however that current turns eastward off the coast of virginia and the waters off the cape are more influenced by the cold canadian  as a result the ocean temperature rarely gets above 65f  18c  except along the shallow west coast of the upper cape and along the southern coast   where water temperatures can sometimes reach 70f  21c  or higher cape cod s climate is also known for a delayed spring season being surrounded by an ocean which is still cold from the winter  however it is also known for an exceptionally mild fall season   thanks to the ocean remaining warm from the summer the highest temperature ever recorded on cape cod was 104f  40c  in provincetown and the lowest temperature ever was 12f  24c  in barnstable the water surrounding cape cod moderates winter temperatures nearly enough to extend the  climate zone to what could be its northernmost limit in eastern north america as the majority of cape cod is in usda  7a consequently many subtropical indicator plant species typically found in more southerly latitudes are grown there including    and  however cape cod falls below the 72f  22c  threshold as the warmest month july averages around 68.25f  20.14c  therefore the climate may be better characterized as either a  or a  climate  particularly on the northern coast of the upper and mid cape which is somewhat sheltered from the cooler onshore wind to the south  precipitation on cape cod and the islands of martha s vineyard and nantucket is the lowest in the new england region averaging slightly less than 40 inches  100cm  a year  most parts of new england average 42 to 46 inches  110 to 120cm  this is due to storm systems which move across western areas building up in mountainous regions and dissipating before reaching the coast where the land has leveled out the region does not experience a greater number of sunny days however as the number of cloudy days is the same as inland locales in addition to increased fog on average roughly 27 inches  69cm  of snow which is about 17 inches  43cm  less than boston falls in an average winter once every five or six years a  accompanied by very high and potentially damaging winds and heavy rain will strike the region about once every 11 or 12 years a  brings damaging winds and  to the region several  storms have struck cape cod since record-keeping began such as a  the  and  in 1954 strong  storms such as the   in 1954 and  in 1991 also caused considerable damage notable  storms include the  and  in 1960 other notable storms include the  which would likely have been rated a strong hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale and the so-called   of october 31 1991 the  produced winds in excess of 80 miles per hour  130km h  and dropped over 24 inches  61cm  of snow on some parts of cape cod the storm knocked out power to tens of thousands of cape cod residents some for up to two weeks 

native population 
cape cod has been the home of the  native american people for many centuries they survived off the sea and were accomplished farmers they understood the principles of  and were known to light  to keep the underbrush in check they helped the  who arrived in the fall of 1620 survive at their new  the wampanoag lost their lands through continued  the documentary natives of the narrowland  1993  narrated by actress  shows the history of the wampanoag people through cape cod archaeological sites in 1974 the mashpee wampanoag tribal council was formed to articulate the concerns of those with native american ancestry they petitioned the federal government in 1975 and again in 1990 for official recognition of the mashpee wampanoag as a tribe in may 2007 the wampanoag tribe was federally recognized history
cape cod was a landmark for early explorers it may have been the  promontory of   mentioned by the  voyagers  9851025  the manomet river area  taken up by the western end of the cape cod canal in the early 20th century  is claimed by some to have been visited by  and a stone wall discovered in provincetown in 1805 is also claimed to have been built by his younger brother  around 1007 ad when the keel of his ship was repaired in the harbor according to  he was killed later in the same journey and is said to have been returned to this spot for burial however there is no tangible support of the presence of norse voyagers in cape cod and the view is not generally accepted by archaeologists or historians  approached it from the south in 1524 he named  claudia after  the wife of  in 1525 portuguese explorer  called it cabo de la arenas while sailing under the  in 1602  named the tip cape cod the surviving term and the ninth oldest english place-name in the u.s  charted its sand-silted harbors in 1606 and  landed there in 1609 captain  noted it on his map of 1614 and at last the  entered the  cape harbor  and  contrary to the popular myth of   made their first landing near present-day  on november 11 1620 nearby in what is now  they had their first encounter with native americans settlement 
cape cod was among the first places settled by the english in north america the cape s fifteen towns developed slowly aside from   1639    1637  and   1639  the final town to be established on the cape was  in 1884 breaking off from sandwich provincetown was a group of huts until the 18th century a channel from  to  is shown on southack s map of 1717 the present cape cod canal was slowly developed from 1870 to 1914 the federal government purchased it in 1928 the cape s vegetation was  and trees were scarce by the time that  saw cape cod during his four visits over 1849 to 1857 because of early colonial settlement and intensive land use the settlers heated by fires and it took 10 to 20 cords  40 to 80 m  of wood to heat a home so they cleared most of cape cod of timber early on they planted familiar crops but these were unsuited to cape cod s thin glacially derived soils for instance much of eastham was planted to wheat the settlers practiced burning of woodlands to release nutrients into the soil improper and intensive farming led to erosion and the loss of topsoil farmers grazed their cattle on the grassy dunes of coastal massachusetts only to watch  in horror as the denuded sands  walked  over richer lands burying cultivated fields and fences  dunes on the outer cape became more common and many harbors filled in with eroded soils by 1800 much of cape cod s firewood had to be transported by boat from  the paucity of vegetation was worsened by the raising of  sheep that reached its peak in new england around 1840 the early  occurred through much of massachusetts and  but it mostly bypassed cape cod due to a lack of significant water power in the area the cape developed as a large fishing and  center as a result and also because of its geographic position after 1860 and the opening of the  farmers abandoned agriculture on the cape by 1950 forests had recovered to an extent not seen since the 18th century modern era

the lighthouses of cape cod




 lighthouses from ancient times have fascinated members of the human race there is something about a lighted beacon that suggests hope and trust and appeals to the better instincts of mankind 


beginning in 1797  were erected along cape cod to aid in navigation   or cape cod light  is the oldest and tallest of these and remains as one of a number of working lighthouses on cape cod and the islands many of cape cod s earliest lighthouses featured a light tower that was attached directly to  and centered on the roof of  the  a stairway to the lantern room was accessible only from the top floor of the house this came to be known as a  lighthouse yet today the only fully intact specimens are on the west coast of the united states 



nauset light erected here in 1923 and moved to a safer location in 1996 is on the national register of historic places


most of cape cod s lighthouses are operated by the u.s coast guard with some exceptions such as the  which has been owned since 1997 by the   national park service  and operated since 2004 in partnership between that agency and the non-profit nauset light preservation society in 1996 both highland light and nauset light were moved further from the shore because they were each at risk of being lost due to erosion by the sea highland light then 110ft  34m  from the ocean was moved 450ft  140m  to the west and nauset light 37ft  11m  from the bluff was moved 300ft  91m  west the lighthouses of cape cod include

road 
cape cod is connected to the mainland by a pair of canal-spanning highway bridges the  and  that were constructed in the 1930s  replacing a 1912 drawbridge  the two parallel road bridges are four miles apart with the bourne bridge to the west and the sagamore to the east the bridges form a bottleneck resulting in traffic backups of several miles during the tourist season  especially going on-cape at the beginning of the weekend and off-cape at the end of the weekend the entire cape is roughly bisected lengthwise by  locally known as the mid-cape highway and officially as the grand army of the republic highway air and water
