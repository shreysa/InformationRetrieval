tropical storm nicholas was a long-lived  in october and november of the  forming from a  on october 13 in the central tropical  nicholas slowly developed due to moderate levels of wind shear throughout its lifetime deep convection slowly organized and nicholas attained a peak intensity of 70mph  110km h  on october 17 after moving west-northwestward for much of its lifetime it turned northward and weakened due to increasing shear the storm again turned to the west and briefly restrengthened but after turning again to the north nicholas transitioned to an  cyclone on october 24 as an extratropical storm nicholas executed a large loop to the west and after moving erratically for a week and organizing into a tropical low it was absorbed by a non-tropical low the low continued westward crossed  and ultimately dissipated over the  on november 5 nicholas had no impact as a tropical cyclone and impact from the low that absorbed the storm was limited to rainfall gusty winds and rough surf nicholas extended the above-average levels of tropical cyclone activity throughout the 2003 season and was one of fourteen seasons to reach fourteen storms the low that absorbed the storm nearly developed into a tropical cyclone which would have been called odette however moderate  prevented further development

the origin of tropical storm nicholas can be traced to a  that moved off the coast of  on october 9 it moved westward and developed a broad  along the wave on october 10 convection organized around the low early on october 12 while located 800miles  1300km  southwest of the  islands as upper level winds became more favorable the system became better organized though the circulation center initially remained located to the west of the area of heavy showers the surface circulation of the large circulation envelope moved towards a position near the western edge of the deepest convection and it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression nineteen late on october 13 while located 1,030miles  1,660km  west-southwest of the cape verde islands located within an area of moderate southwesterly  the depression was slow to organize  early on october 14 a clear center was not depicted on  satellite imagery the depression moved to the west-northwest and gradually strengthened into tropical storm nicholas late on october 14 while located 1,200miles  1,930km  east of the  on october 15 deep convection became much better organized though the center of nicholas remained displaced from the deepest of the shower activity despite the shear the storm continued to strengthen as it moved to the west-northwest a motion caused by a mid-level  to its north on october 16 nicholas transitioned from a sheared unorganized system to a more organized system as a result of  and improvement in its convective pattern due to lesser amounts of vertical shear and a healthier  over the storm nicholas continued to strengthen and attained a peak intensity of 70mph  110km h  on october 17 while located 875miles  1,410km  east of the leeward islands  suggested nicholas potentially attained hurricane status though microwave images of the storm showed a sheared system without any evidence of an

shortly after peaking in strength nicholas weakened due to increasing southwesterly wind shear and the center of circulation briefly became exposed from the deep convection in response to a break in the  the storm turned to the north on october 18 nicholas turned more to the west on october 20 and later on the winds in the storm decreased to minimal storm strength convection diminished greatly though nicholas unexpectedly re-strengthened as deep convection refired after reaching winds of 50mph  85km h  the storm again weakened due to increasing shear and after turning to the northwest nicholas degenerated into a tropical depression on october 23 nicholas tracked northward in response to a break in the subtropical ridge and on october 24 after degenerating to a remnant  nicholas lost what tropical characteristics it retained and transitioned into an  cyclone the remnant storm executed a large anticyclonic loop resulting in a westward motion and a brief re-intensification into an extratropical storm on october 29 the storm continued to the west along a  associated with a non-tropical low to its southwest and executed a second anticyclonic loop to the south on october 30 convection increased over the low-level circulation of what was left to nicholas and the national hurricane center indicated a potential for tropical or  development as it moved towards warmer waters the system executed a small cyclonic loop and on october 31 the system organized into a tropical low it turned westward towards a non-tropical low and on november 1 the remnants of nicholas was absorbed by the low on november 1 convection increased in the complex system that absorbed the remnants of nicholas and the national hurricane center indicated the system could develop into a tropical or subtropical cyclone at any time the low continued quickly westward generating only sporadic convection and crossed  on november 3 after entering the  it turned to the west-northwest and without organizing it made landfall in southeast  on november 4 it continued inland and quickly weakened over louisiana and  on november 5 impact records and naming 
the non-tropical low that absorbed nicholas dropped locally heavy rainfall across the  and southern  as well as in portions of the northern  gusty winds from the low produced heavy surf and rip currents along the east and west coast of florida and a wind gust of 35mph  55km h  was recorded in  as a  from the system moved ashore the low also resulted in two to four foot  0.6 to 1.2m  swells along the  overall no damage or deaths were associated with nicholas or the low that absorbed it operationally the  determined if the non-tropical low that absorbed nicholas developed into a tropical or subtropical storm it would be named odette in post-season analysis the center considered classifying the system as an unnumbered tropical depression though lack of sufficient characteristics of a tropical depression prevented the classification if nicholas had attained hurricane status it would have been one of eight tropical cyclones to reach hurricane status in october in the deep tropical atlantic since 1900 see also
