the standard atmosphere  symbol  atm  is a unit of  defined as 101325  1.01325bar  it is sometimes used as a reference or standard pressure

history 
in 1954 the 10th confrence gnrale des poids et mesures   adopted standard atmosphere for general use and affirmed its definition of being precisely equal to 1,013,250  per   101325  this value was intended to represent the mean atmospheric pressure at mean sea level at the latitude of   and does reflect the mean sea level pressure for many industrialized nations that are at broadly similar latitudes in  and in various industries the reference pressure referred to in   stp  was commonly 1atm  101.325kpa  but standards have since diverged  in 1982 the   iupac  recommended that for the purposes of specifying the physical properties of substances standard pressure should be precisely 100  1  pressure units and equivalencies 

a pressure of 1atm can also be stated as

  1 ata  atmosphere absolute  the ata unit is used in place of atm to indicate that the pressure shown is the total ambient pressure compared to vacuum of the system being calculated or measured for example for underwater pressures a pressure of 3.1 ata would mean that the 1 atm of the air above water is included in this value and the pressure due to water would total 2.1 atm 

notes 



 torr and mm-hg 0c are often taken to be identical for most practical purposes  to 5 significant digits  they are interchangeable ^    this is the customarily accepted value for cmh2o 4 c it is precisely the product of 1kg-force per square centimeter  one technical atmosphere  times 1.01325  bar atmosphere  divided by 0.980665  one gram-force  it is not accepted practice to define the value for water column based on a true physical realization of water  which would be 99.997495 of this value because the true maximum density of  is 0.99997495 kg l at 3.984 c  also this physical realization would still ignore the 8.285cmh2o reduction that would actually occur in a true physical realization due to the vapor pressure over water at 3.984 c ^    value of 13.595078 5  g ml assumed for the density of hg at 0 c


other applications 
 and others use the word atmosphere and  atm  in relation to pressures that are relative to mean atmospheric pressure at sea level  1.013 bar   for example a partial pressure of oxygen is calibrated typically using air at sea level so is expressed in units of atm the old european unit   at  is equal to 1   kgf cm2  700498066500000000098066.5pa
