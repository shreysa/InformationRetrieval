this article refers to the use of computers to estimate losses caused by disasters for other meanings of the word catastrophe including  in mathematics see  
catastrophe modeling  also known as cat modeling  is the process of usingassisted calculations to estimate the losses that could be sustained due to a catastrophic event such as a hurricane or earthquake cat modeling is especially applicable to analyzing risks in the  industry and is at the confluence of    and  


contents














perils analyzed 
natural catastrophes  sometimes referred to as  nat cat  include 

  main peril is wind damage  some models can also include storm surge 
  main peril is ground shaking  some models can also include  fire following earthquakes and sprinkler leakage damage 
severe   main perils are  and  





human catastrophes include 

 events

casualty liability events
displacement crises

lines of business modeled 

personal property
commercial property
workers  compensation
automobile physical damage
limited liabilities
product liability
business interruption

input 
the input into a typical cat modeling software package is information on the exposures being analyzed that are vulnerable to catastrophe risk the exposure data can be categorized into three basic groups 

information on the site locations referred to as geocoding data  street address postal code county cresta zone et cetera 
information on the physical characteristics of the exposures  construction occupation occupancy year built number of stories number of employees et cetera 
information on the financial terms of the insurance coverage  coverage value limit deductible et cetera 

output 
the output is an estimate of the losses that the model predicts would be associated with a particular event or set of events when running a  the output is either a probabilistic loss distribution or a set of events that could be used to create a loss distribution  probable maximum losses  pmls  and average annual losses  aals  are calculated from the loss distribution when running a deterministic model losses caused by a specific event are calculated  for example  or  a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in downtown san francisco  could be analyzed against the portfolio of exposures uses 

insurers and risk managers use cat modeling to assess the risk in a portfolio of exposures this might help guide an insurer s underwriting strategy or help them decide how much  to purchase some state departments of insurance allow insurers to use cat modeling in their rate filings to help determine how much premium their policyholders are charged in catastrophe-prone areas insurance rating agencies such as  and  use cat modeling to assess the financial strength of insurers that take on catastrophe risk reinsurers and reinsurance brokers use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of reinsurance treaties european insurers use cat models to derive the required regulatory capital under the solvency ii regime cat models are used to derive catastrophe loss probability distributions which are components of many solvency ii internal capital models likewise cat bond investors investment banks and bond rating agencies use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of  
open catastrophe modeling 
recently an effort to create and disseminate open multi-hazard cat risk modeling tools was initiated by the  also oasis loss modelling framework  lmf   has been created it has been founded as a not for profit organisation funded and owned by the insurance industry to promote open access to models and to promote transparency open source code to be available operating on the oasis lmf  the cat risk modelling platform has been brought to market by  to provide the  re insurance industry with a deeper understanding of risk the modex platform allows model providers from all over the world to make their models available to the industry using the oasis framework by creating a marketplace where model developers can make their models available via a single user interface the platform lowers the barriers to entry in the cat model marketplace and encourages the development of new and improved cat risk models additionally the insurance industry is currently working with the  to develop an industry standard for collecting and sharing exposure data to date the industry has been operating on closed proprietary data formats see also
