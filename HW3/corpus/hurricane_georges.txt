conditions became nearly ideal for continued development including warm water temperatures low-level inflow to the hurricane s north and good upper-level outflow a banding eye developed and georges reached major hurricane strength on september 19 while 675  1085  east-southeast of  by september 19 an upper-level anticyclone was well established over georges and satellite pictures suggested that the hurricane was beginning to strengthen rapidly as indicated by the cooling cloud tops increased symmetry of the deep convection and the warming and contracting of the well-defined 40mi  63km  wide eye as rapid intensification continued and georges peaked at a very dangerous  storm with 155mph  250km h  wind and a 937 minimal pressure late on september 19 and early september 20 at that time georges was the most intense strongest storm since  and alongside  it is one of the largest major hurricanes in the atlantic with hurricane force windfields extending more than 150mi  250km  from the center and with a more than 300mi  490km  wide tropical storm force windfield shortly after peaking upper-level wind shear from the development of an upper-level low weakened the hurricane on september 20 in the afternoon as the central pressure had risen 26  as georges approached the  on september 21 after weakening considerably  georges made landfall directly on  and three hours later in  though its 175 mi  280km  wide tropical storm force windfield affected all the leeward islands after weakening to a  over the caribbean upper-level shear decreased and georges strengthened a bit before making landfall near  as a 115mph  175km h  category 3 hurricane early in the morning over the mountainous terrain of the island the hurricane weakened again but over the  it again re-intensified to hit eastern  with winds of 120mph  195km h  on september 22 like in  georges was greatly weakened by the mountainous terrain and after crossing the  it struck 30mi  48km  east of   on september 23 well-defined upper-level outflow allowed the hurricane to remain well organized and while paralleling the northern coastline of the island georges retained minimal hurricane status hurricane georges reached the  on september 24 and as it had done earlier in its lifetime quickly restrengthened to category2 status on the september 25 due to warm water temperatures and little upper-level shear it continued to the west-northwest and struck  later on september 25 with winds of 105mph  165km h  despite moving over warmer water georges only managed to peak at 110mph  175km h  in the gulf of mexico likely due to its disrupted inner core a mid-tropospheric anticyclone pushed the hurricane slowly north-northwestward forcing georges to make its seventh and final landfall near  on september 28 within 24hours georges had weakened to a tropical depression and due to weak steering currents the storm looped over southern  then drifted to the east the weak circulation moved eastward over the interior of the  and dissipated on october 1 near the   border preparations
