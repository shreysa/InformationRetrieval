in  the baroclinity  often called baroclinicity  of a stratified fluid is a measure of how misaligned the gradient of pressure is from the gradient of density in a fluid in  a baroclinic atmosphere is one for which the density depends on both the temperature and the pressure  contrast this with a  atmosphere for which the density depends only on the pressure in atmospheric terms the barotropic zones of the earth are generally found in the central latitudes or  whereas the baroclinic areas are generally found in the mid-latitude polar regions baroclinity is proportional to



which is proportional to the sine of the angle between surfaces of constant  and surfaces of constant  thus in a barotropic fluid  which is defined by zero baroclinity  these surfaces are parallel areas of high atmospheric baroclinity are characterized by the frequent formation of  baroclinic instability 
baroclinic instability is a fluid dynamical instability of fundamental importance in the  and in the  in the atmosphere it is the dominant mechanism shaping the  and  that dominate  in mid-latitudes in the ocean it generates a field of   100km or smaller   that play various roles in oceanic dynamics and the transport of  baroclinic instability is a concept relevant to rapidly rotating strongly  fluids whether a fluid counts as rapidly rotating is determined in this context by the  which is a measure of how close the flow is to solid body rotation more precisely a flow in solid body rotation has  that is proportional to its  the rossby number is a measure of the departure of the vorticity from that of solid body rotation the rossby number must be small for the concept of baroclinic instability to be relevant when the rossby number is large other kinds of instabilities often referred to as inertial become more relevant the simplest example of a stably stratified flow is an incompressible flow with density decreasing with height in a compressible gas such as the atmosphere the relevant measure is the vertical gradient of the  which must increase with height for the flow to be stably stratified one measures the strength of the stratification by asking how large the vertical shear of the horizontal winds has to be in order to destabilize the flow and produce the classic  this measure is the  when the richardson number is large the stratification is strong enough to prevent this shear instability before the classic work of  and  on baroclinic instability in the late 1940s most theories trying to explain the structure of mid-latitude eddies took as their starting points the high rossby number or small richardson number instabilities familiar to fluid dynamicists at that time the most important feature of baroclinic instability is that it exists even in the situation of rapid rotation  small rossby number  and strong stable stratification  large richardson s number  typically observed in the atmosphere the energy source for baroclinic instability is the  in the environmental flow as the instability grows the  of the fluid is lowered in growing waves in the atmosphere cold air moving downwards and equatorwards displaces the warmer air moving polewards and upwards baroclinic instability can be investigated in the laboratory using a rotating fluid filled  the annulus is heated at the outer wall and cooled at the inner wall and the resulting fluid flows give rise to baroclinically unstable waves the term  baroclinic  refers to the mechanism by which  is generated vorticity is the curl of the velocity field in general the evolution of vorticity can be broken into contributions from advection  as vortex tubes move with the flow   and twisting  as vortex tubes are pulled or twisted by the flow  and baroclinic vorticity generation which occurs whenever there is a density gradient along surfaces of constant pressure baroclinic flows can be contrasted with  flows in which density and pressure surfaces coincide and there is no baroclinic generation of vorticity the study of the evolution of these baroclinic instabilities as they grow and then decay is a crucial part of developing theories for the fundamental characteristics of midlatitude weather baroclinic vector 
beginning with the equation of motion for a frictionless fluid  the   and taking the curl one arrives at the  that is to say the  in a fluid that is not all of the same density a source term appears in the  whenever surfaces of constant density   surfaces  and surfaces of constant pressure   surfaces  are not aligned the  of the local vorticity is given by



 where  is the velocity and  is the   is pressure and  is density  the baroclinic contribution is the vector



this vector is of interest both in compressible fluids and in incompressible  but inhomogeneous  fluids internal  as well as unstable rayleightaylor modes can be analyzed from the perspective of the baroclinic vector it is also of interest in the creation of vorticity by the passage of shocks through inhomogeneous media such as in the  divers may be familiar with the very slow waves that can be excited at a thermocline or a halocline  these are internal waves similar waves can be generated between a layer of water and a layer of oil when the interface between these two surfaces is not horizontal and the system is close to hydrostatic equilibrium the gradient of the pressure is vertical but the gradient of the density is not therefore the baroclinic vector is nonzero and the sense of the baroclinic vector is to create vorticity to make the interface level out in the process the interface overshoots and the result is an oscillation which is an internal gravity wave unlike surface gravity waves internal gravity waves do not require a sharp interface for example in bodies of water a gradual gradient in temperature or salinity is sufficient to support internal gravity waves driven by the baroclinic vector notes
