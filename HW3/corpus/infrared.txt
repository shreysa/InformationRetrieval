infrared in relation to electromagnetic spectrum



natural infrared 
sunlight at an effective temperature of 5,780 kelvins is composed of near thermal-spectrum radiation that is slightly more than half infrared at zenith sunlight provides an  of just over 1 per square meter at sea level of this energy 527 watts is infrared radiation 445 watts is  and 32 watts is  radiation nearly all the infrared radiation in sunlight is near infrared shorter than 4 micrometers on the surface of earth at far lower temperatures than the surface of the sun almost all thermal radiation consists of infrared in mid-infrared region much longer than in sunlight of these natural thermal radiation processes only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light energy regions within the infrared 
in general objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object in accordance with  therefore the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections commonly used sub-division scheme 
a commonly used sub-division scheme is 

 temperatures of black bodies for which spectral peaks fall at the given wavelengths according to 








a comparison of a thermal image  top  and an ordinary photograph  bottom  shows that a trash bag is transparent but glass  the man s spectacles  is opaque in long-wavelength infrared 

nir and swir is sometimes called  reflected infrared  whereas mwir and lwir is sometimes referred to as  thermal infrared  due to the nature of the blackbody radiation curves typical  hot  objects such as exhaust pipes often appear brighter in the mw compared to the same object viewed in the lw cie division scheme 
the   cie  recommended the division of infrared radiation into the following three bands 

iso 20473 scheme 
 20473 specifies the following scheme 

astronomy division scheme 
astronomers typically divide the infrared spectrum as follows 

these divisions are not precise and can vary depending on the publication the three regions are used for observation of different temperature ranges and hence different environments in space the most common photometric system used in astronomy allocates capital  according to filters used  i j h and k cover the near-infrared wavelengths  l m n and q refer to the mid-infrared region these letters are commonly understood in reference to  and appear for instance in the titles of many  sensor response division scheme 




plot of atmospheric transmittance in part of the infrared region 

a third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various detectors 

near-infrared  from 0.7 to 1.0m  from the approximate end of the response of the  to that of silicon  short-wave infrared  1.0 to 3m  from the cut-off of silicon to that of the mwir atmospheric window  ingaas covers to about 1.8m  the less sensitive lead salts cover this region mid-wave infrared  3 to 5m  defined by the atmospheric window and covered by    long-wave infrared  8 to 12 or 7 to 14m  this is the atmospheric window covered by hgcdte and   very-long wave infrared  vlwir   12 to about 30m covered by doped silicon  
near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the  mid and  are progressively further from the  other definitions follow different physical mechanisms  emission peaks vs bands water absorption  and the newest follow technical reasons  the common  detectors are sensitive to about 1,050nm while  s sensitivity starts around 950nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600nm depending on the specific configuration  no international standards for these specifications are currently available the onset of infrared is defined  according to different standards  at various values typically between 700nm and 800nm but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined the human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700nm wavelength so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources however particularly intense near-ir light  e.g from ir  ir led sources or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels  can be detected up to approximately 780nm and will be perceived as red light intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050nm can be seen as a dull red glow causing some difficulty in near-ir illumination of scenes in the dark  usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination  leaves are particularly bright in the near ir and if all visible light leaks from around an ir-filter are blocked and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque ir-passing photographic filter it is possible to see the  that consists of ir-glowing foliage telecommunication bands in the infrared 
in  the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting absorbing materials  fibers  and detectors 

the c-band is the dominant band for long-distance  networks the s and l bands are based on less well established technology and are not as widely deployed heat

infrared radiation is popularly known as  heat radiation  but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them infrared light from the sun accounts for 49 of the heating of earth with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths visible light oremitting  can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation objects at room  will   concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25m band but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects  see  and    is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference unlike heat transmitted by  or  thermal radiation can propagate through a  thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared extending into visible ultraviolet and even x-ray regions  e.g the   thus the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical  comparatively low  temperatures often found near the surface of planet earth the concept of  is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects this is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a  to further explain two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity for example for any pre-set emissivity value objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler for that reason incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers applications

active-infrared night vision  the camera illuminates the scene at infrared wavelengths invisible to the  despite a dark back-lit scene active-infrared night vision delivers identifying details as seen on the display monitor 

infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient  to see  operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source the use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with  which creates images based on differences in surface temperature by detecting infrared radiation   that emanates from objects and their surrounding environment thermography 




thermography helped to determine the temperature profile of the  during re-entry 

main article  
infrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects  if the emissivity is known  this is termed thermography or in the case of very hot objects in the nir or visible it is termed  thermography  thermal imaging  is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs  detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum  roughly 90014,000 nanometers or 0.914m  and produce images of that radiation since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures according to the  radiation law thermography makes it possible to  see  one s environment with or without visible illumination the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature  hence the name  hyperspectral imaging

tracking 
main article  
infrared tracking also known as infrared homing refers to a  which uses the  from a target of  in the infrared part of the  to track it missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as  heat-seekers  since infrared  ir  is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies many objects such as people vehicle engines and aircraft generate and retain heat and as such are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background heating 
main article  

infrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source for example it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants it may also be used in other heating applications such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft  de-icing  infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque absorbent objects rather than the air around them infrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes e.g curing of coatings forming of plastics annealing plastic welding and print drying in these applications infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating efficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material cooling 
main article  
a variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems the lwir  815 m  region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere communications 
ir data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and  these devices usually conform to standards published by  the infrared data association remote controls and irda devices use infrared   leds  to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic  into a narrow beam the beam is  i.e switched on and off to prevent interference from other sources of infrared  like sunlight or artificial lighting  the receiver uses a   to convert the infrared radiation to an  it responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density ir does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms infrared is the most common way for  to command appliances infrared remote control protocols like   are used to communicate with infrared  using infrared  can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit s compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable except for the radiation damage  since the eye cannot detect ir blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen 
infrared lasers are used to provide the light for  communications systems infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330nm  least   or 1,550nm  best transmission  are the best choices for standard  fibers ir data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the  project transmitting ir data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as  spectroscopy

in the semiconductor industry infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures by measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer the index of refraction  n  and the extinction coefficient  k  can be determined via the  the reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension depth and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures meteorology

astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components including mirrors lenses and solid state digital detectors for this reason it is classified as part of  to form an image the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources and the detectors are chilled using liquid  the sensitivity of earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected  this limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy the infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers cold dark  of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars infrared can also be used to detect  before they begin to emit visible light stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum so nearby cool objects such as  can be more readily detected  in the visible light spectrum the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet 
infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of  which are often cloaked in gas and dust distant galaxies with a high  will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths so they are more readily observed in the infrared infrared cleaning
