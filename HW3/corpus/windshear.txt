definition 
wind shear refers to the variation of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30   15m s  for light aircraft and near 45   22m s  for airliners at flight altitude vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots  2.5m s  also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during take off and landing in disastrous ways and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear  headwind loss in excess of 30 knots  the rationale for this additional caution includes   1  microburst intensity can double in a minute or less  2  the winds can shift to excessive cross wind  3  40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations and  4  several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms the additional hazard of  is often associated with wind shear where and when it is strongly observed

weather situations where shear is observed include 

 significant shear is observed when the temperature difference across the front is 5c  9f  or more and the front moves at 30  or faster because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and  and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically vertical wind shear above warm fronts is more of an aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration upper-level jet streams associated with upper level jet streams is a phenomenon known as   cat  caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient at the edge of the jet streams the cat is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet usually next to or just below the axis of the jet low-level jet streams when a nocturnal low-level jet forms overnight above the earth s surface ahead of a cold front significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low level jet this is also known as nonconvective wind shear since it is not due to nearby thunderstorms mountains when winds blow over a mountain vertical shear is observed on the  side if the flow is strong enough turbulent  known as  rotors  associated with  may form which are dangerous to ascending and descending aircraft  when on a clear and calm night a radiation inversion is formed near the ground the  does not affect wind above the top of the inversion layer the change in wind can be 90degrees in direction and 40kt in speed even a nocturnal  overnight  low level jet can sometimes be observed it tends to be strongest towards sunrise density differences cause additional problems to aviation  when an outflow boundary forms due to a shallow layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm both speed and directional wind shear can result at the leading edge of the three dimensional boundary the stronger the  is the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will become

weather fronts are boundaries between two masses of air of different  or different temperature and moisture properties which normally are  in the wind field and are the principal cause of significant weather within surface weather analyses they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols the air masses usually differ in  and may also differ in  wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries  feature narrow bands of  and  and may be preceded by  and  cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts when a front becomes  it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed known as a  though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant in the   move from east to west across the  and eastern  directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and  boundaries near coastlines

the magnitude of winds offshore are nearly double the wind speed observed onshore this is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters sometimes there are even directional differences particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours vertical component

thermal wind is a meteorological term not referring to an actual  but a difference in the  between two   and  with   in essence wind shear it is only present in an atmosphere with horizontal changes in   or in an ocean with horizontal gradients of   i.e  in a  atmosphere where temperature is uniform the geostrophic wind is independent of height the name stems from the fact that this wind flows around areas of low  and high  temperature in the same manner as the  flows around areas of   and    the thermal wind equation is

effects on thunderstorms and severe weather 
main article  
severe thunderstorms which can spawn  and hailstorms require wind shear to organize the storm in such a way as to maintain the  for a longer period of time this occurs as the storm s inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow an increasing nocturnal or overnight low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm moist air and kills the thunderstorm

gliding 




glider ground launch affected by wind shear 

in gliding wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a  wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on  also known as winch launches or wire launches if the wind gradient is significant or sudden or both and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude the indicated airspeed will increase possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed the pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient when landing wind shear is also a hazard particularly when the winds are strong as the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing airspeed decreases while sink rate increases and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact the pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it wind shear is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground it is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long  which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given  angle the different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing causing a loss of control accident parachuting 
wind shear or wind gradients are a threat to parachutists particularly to  and  skydivers have been pushed off of their course by sudden shifts in wind direction and speed and have collided with bridges cliffsides trees other skydivers the ground and other obstacles  skydivers routinely make adjustments to the position of their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion soaring 
soaring related to wind shear also called  is a technique used by  like  who can maintain flight without wing flapping if the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude a bird can climb into the wind gradient trading ground speed for height while maintaining airspeed by then turning downwind and diving through the wind gradient they can also gain energy it has also been used by  on rare occasions wind shear can also create  this occurs when an  separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction if the wind encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by  coming up from below it will create significant shear waves that can be used for soaring impact on passenger aircraft 




effect of wind shear on aircraft trajectory note how merely correcting for the initial gust front can have dire consequences 

strong outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level initially this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear as the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft the localized headwind diminishes reducing the aircraft s airspeed and increasing its sink rate then when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft the headwind becomes a tailwind reducing lift generated by the wings and leaving the aircraft in a low-power low-speed descent this can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact

as the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s most notably following the 1985 crash of  in 1988 the u.s  mandated that all commercial aircraft have  by 1993 between 1964 and 1985 wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the u.s that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries since 1995 the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of doppler  units on the ground    the installation of high-resolution  stations at many u.s airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions sailing 
wind shear affects  in motion by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the  the effect of low level wind shear can be factored into the selection of  in the sail design but this can be difficult to predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions  may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear for example using a  sound propagation
