typhoon tip known in the philippines as typhoon warling was the largest and most intense  ever recorded the nineteenth storm and twelfth typhoon of the  tip developed out of a disturbance from the  on october4 near  initially a tropical storm to the northwest hindered the development and motion of tip though after it tracked farther north tip was able to intensify after passing  tip  and reached peak winds of 305km h  190mph  and a worldwide record-low  of 870  870.0  25.69  on october12 at its peak strength it was also the largest tropical cyclone on record with a wind diameter of 2,220km  1,380mi  tip slowly weakened as it continued west-northwestward and later turned to the northeast in response to an approaching  the typhoon made  in southern japan on october19 and became an  shortly thereafter  flew 60 missions into the typhoon making tip one of the most closely observed tropical cyclones rainfall from tip indirectly led to a fire that killed 13 and injured 68 at  in the  of japan elsewhere in the country the typhoon caused widespread flooding and 42deaths  offshore shipwrecks left 44people killed or missing

while executing a loop near chuuk the tropical depression intensified into tropical storm tip though the storm failed to organize significantly due to the influence of tropical storm roger reconnaissance aircraft provided the track of the surface circulation since satellite imagery estimated the center was about 60km  37mi  from its true position after drifting erratically for several days tip began a steady northwest motion on october8 by that time tropical storm roger had become an  resulting in the southerly flow to be entrained into tip an area of a  moved north of guam at the time providing an excellent  north of tip initially tip was predicted to continue northwestward and make  on guam though it turned to the west early on october9 passing about 45km  28mi  south of guam later that day tip intensified to attain typhoon status owing to very favorable conditions for development typhoon tip  over the open waters of the western  late on october10 tip attained wind speeds equal to category4 strength on the  and it became a  the next day the central  dropped by 92  92.0hpa  2.72inhg  from october9 to 11 during which the circulation pattern of typhoon tip expanded to a record diameter of 2,220km  1,380mi  tip continued to intensify further and early on october12 reconnaissance aircraft recorded a worldwide record-low pressure of 870mbar  870.0hpa  25.69inhg  with winds of 305km h  190mph  when tip was located about 840km  520mi  west-northwest of guam in its best track the  listed tip as peaking with 10-minute sustained winds of 160mph  260km h  at the time of its peak strength its  was 15km  9.3mi  wide tip crossed the  on the afternoon of october13 prompting the  to issue warnings on typhoon tip assigning it the local name warling after peaking intensity tip weakened to 230km h  140mph  and remained at that intensity for several days as it continued west-northwestward for five days after its peak strength the average radius of winds stronger than 55km h  34mph  extended over 1,100km  684mi  on october17 tip began to weaken steadily and decrease in size recurving northeastward under the influence of a mid-level  the next day after passing about 65km  40mi  east of  the typhoon accelerated to 75km h  47mph  tip made landfall on the japanese island of  with winds of about 130km h  81mph  on october19 it continued rapidly northeastward through the country and became an extratropical cyclone over northern honsh a few hours after moving ashore the extratropical remnant of tip proceeded northeastward and gradually weakened crossing the  on october22 the storm was last observed near the  of  on october 24 impact 

the typhoon produced heavy rainfall early in its lifetime while passing near guam including a total of 23.1cm  9.09in  at  the outer  of the large circulation of tip produced moderate rainfall in the mountainous regions of the philippine island of  heavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at  a training facility for the  near  marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts situated at the base of a hill which housed a fuel farm the breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders releasing large quantities of fuel the fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts the resultant fire killed 13 marines injured 68 and caused moderate damage to the facility the facility s barracks were destroyed along with fifteen huts and several other structures the barracks were rebuilt and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire during recurvature typhoon tip passed about 65km  40mi  east of okinawa sustained winds reached 72km h  44mph  with gusts to 112km h  69mph  sustained wind velocities in japan are not known though they were estimated at minimal typhoon strength the passage of the typhoon through the region resulted in millions of dollars in damage to the agricultural and fishing industries of the country eight ships were grounded or sunk by tip leaving 44fishermen dead or unaccounted for a chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon though its crew of 46 were rescued the rainfall led to over 600 throughout the mountainous regions of japan and flooded more than 22,000homes  42people died throughout the country with another 71missing and 283injured river embankments broke in 70 places destroying 27 bridges while about 105 dikes were destroyed following the storm at least 11,000 people were left homeless tip destroyed apple rice peach and other crops five ships sank in heavy seas off the coast and 50-story buildings swayed in the capital  transportation in the country was disrupted  200 trains and 160 domestic flights were canceled tip was described as the most severe storm to strike japan in 13 years records and meteorological statistics

typhoon tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record with a diameter of 1,380mi  2,220km almost double the previous record of 700mi  1,130km  set by  in august 1951 at its largest tip was nearly half the size of the  the temperature inside the  of typhoon tip at peak intensity was 30  86  and described as exceptionally high with 10-minute sustained winds of 160mph  260km h  typhoon tip is the strongest cyclone in the complete tropical cyclone listing by the japan meteorological agency the typhoon was also the most intense tropical cyclone on record with a pressure of 870mbar  25.69inhg  6mbar  0.18inhg  lower than the previous record set by  in  the records set by tip still technically stand though with the end of routine  flights in the western pacific ocean in august 1987 modern researchers have questioned whether tip indeed remains the strongest after a detailed study three researchers determined that two typhoons  in 1995 and  in 1992 registered higher  than tip and concluded that one or both of the two may have therefore been more intense other recent storms may have also been deeper than tip at its peak  for instance satellite-derived intensity estimates for  of  indicated that its core pressure may have been as low as 858mbar  25.34inhg  due to the dearth of  into these cyclones conclusive data are lacking despite the typhoon s intensity and damage the  tip was not  and was reused in   and
