production
 got interested in a  hurricane  carter biopic in 1992  purchased the filming rights through  and went on to write the first scripts while establishing a financing partnership with  at first jewison felt the story was so extensive that it would fit better as a television miniseries once denzel washington signed to play the title character he went through long boxing training and worked closely with rubin carter washington said  he went through pots and pots of coffee and packs of cigarettes i d drink a little coffee it s interesting and challenging when the person is there alive and in the room  filming began in november 1998 with locations in both    in  and the cities of  and paterson  and  soundtrack
the hurricane premiered on september 17 1999 at the  it also was featured at the  on february 17 2000 two weeks prior to its opening in north america a premiere for the hurricane was held at the  in los angeles many of the depicted people were in attendance when asked about being portrayed by denzel washington rubin carter replied that i didnt know i was that good-looking  the film was praised by lesra martin who described it as  a stupendous depiction of accurate events  and john artis carter s friend who was convicted with him said he was in awe to see what unfolded and not have to feel the pressure i felt at the time an objection was held by h lee sarokin the federal judge who freed carter saying that unlike his portrayal by rod steiger im a lower-key guy box office 
the film opened in north american limited release on december 29 1999 the first week s gross was  384,640  11 screens  and the total receipts for the run were  50,668,906 in its widest release the film was featured in 2,148 theaters it closed the week of april 14 2000 the motion picture was in circulation sixteen weeks critical response 
reviews were positive with much praise to denzel washington s performance the film has an 83 approval rating at  based on 113 reviews the consensus reads   thanks in large part to one of denzel washington s most powerful on-screen performances the hurricane is a moving inspirational sports drama even if it takes few risks in telling its story   film critic for the chicago sun times liked the film and the acting and wrote  this is one of denzel washington s great performances on a par with his work inwashington as hurricane carter is spare focused filled with anger and pride this is strong stuff and i was amazed after feeling some impatience in the earlier reaches of the film to find myself so deeply absorbed in its second and third acts until at the end i was blinking at tears what affects me emotionally at the movies is never sadness but goodness 
regarding the  fictionalized  aspects of the film ebert discussed why that is often the case in films   several people have told me dubiously that they heard the movie was  fictionalized  well of course it was those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother most biopics like most grandmothers see the good in a man and demonize his enemies they pass silently over his imprudent romances in dramatizing his victories they simplify them and they provide the best roles to the most interesting characters if they didn t we wouldn t pay to see them  he added  the hurricane is not a documentary but a parable in which two lives are saved by the power of the written word 
film critic  writing for the new york times had mixed views of the film but did like the acting he wrote  in telling the story of mr carter s protracted and ultimately successful fight for freedom and justice the hurricane rides to glory on an astonishing performance by denzel washington....that is to say mr washington leans into an otherwise schlocky movie and slams it out of the ballpark if his hurricane is an inspiring portrait of nobility it is because the actor never conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his character s forcefully articulate surface 
holden was forthright about the veracity of the film writing  the film is so eager to stir us up that it thinks little of bending the facts for dramatic effect among its most egregious distortions is its depiction of mr carter s 1964 middleweight title match with joey giardello the movie  which has fine naturalistic boxing sequences  inaccurately portrays the fight as lost by carter solely because of the judges  racism the taking of such license of course adds an extra jolt of drama but when these and other distortions and exaggerations are added up it s worth wondering if that self-congratulatory glow the movie leaves us with has been gotten far too easily and at what cost 
jewison considers the hurricane his best work accolades

controversy
the film was criticized for misrepresenting many of the facts of carter s life and the case itself as documented in both his criminal and military records and police reports and court documentation such critics include  herald-news reporter cal deal    thomas clough  barbara burns the daughter of victim hazel tanis  george kimball of   milan simonich of the   lona manning   reporter robert lipsyte  paul mulshine of   and jack newfield of the  who stated  i knew rubin carter attended his fights covered his retrial and i didn t see much reality on the screen   film critic david denby called it   false evasive and factually very thin  a liberal fairytale 
lawsuit 
former  world champion  sued the film s producers for  over the depiction of his fight with carter as a  racist fix   this is a joke  he never hit me that much in 15 rounds virtually every boxing expert then and now will tell you i won the fight  referee robert polis who scored the fight 7266 in giardello s favor stated   they portrayed joey giardello as an incompetent fighter i thought it was ludicrous  even carter himself agreed that giardello was the rightful victor eventually the case was settled out of court with the producers paying the retired champion damages and with jewison agreeing to make a statement on the dvd version that  giardello no doubt was a great fighter
