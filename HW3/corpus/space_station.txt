the first space station was  which was launched by the  on april 19 1971 like all the early space stations it was  monolithic  intended to be constructed and launched in one piece and then inhabited by a crew later as such monolithic stations generally contained all their supplies and experimental equipment when launched and were considered  expended  and then abandoned when these were used up the earlier soviet stations were all designated  salyut  but among these there were two distinct types  civilian and military the military stations   and  were also known as  stations the civilian stations  and  were built with two docking ports which allowed a second crew to visit bringing a new spacecraft with them  the  could spend 90 days in space after which point it needed to be replaced by a fresh soyuz spacecraft this allowed for a crew to man the station continually  was also equipped with two docking ports like second-generation stations but the extra port was never utilized the presence of a second port on the new stations allowed  supply vehicles to be docked to the station meaning that fresh supplies could be brought to aid long-duration missions this concept was expanded on salyut 7 which  hard docked  with a  shortly before it was abandoned  this served as a proof-of-concept for the use of modular space stations the later salyuts may reasonably be seen as a transition between the two groups mir  19862001

unlike previous stations the soviet space station  had a  design  a core unit was launched and additional modules generally with a specific role were later added to that this method allows for greater flexibility in operation as well as removing the need for a single immensely powerful  modular stations are also designed from the outset to have their supplies provided by logistical support which allows for a longer lifetime at the cost of requiring regular support launches iss  1998present

the core module of the international space station was launched in 1998 the iss is divided into two main sections the  orbital segment  ros  and the  operational segment  usos  usos modules were brought to the station by the  and manually attached to the iss by crews during  connections are made manually for electrical data propulsion and cooling fluids this results in a single piece which is not designed for disassembly

these stations have various issues that limit their long-term habitability such as very low recycling rates relatively high radiation levels and a lack of weight some of these problems cause discomfort and long-term health effects in the case of solar flares all current habitants are protected by the earth s magnetic field and are below the  future  may attempt to address these issues and could be intended for long-term occupation some designs might even accommodate large numbers of people essentially  cities in space  where people would make their homes no such design has yet been constructed since even for a small station the current  2016  launch costs are not economically or politically viable possible ways to deal with these costs would be to build a large number of rockets  economies of scale  employ reusable rockets  or  methods such as  for example in 1975 proposing to seek long-term habitability through  and enough mass in space to allow high  the most ambitious historical  study a conceptual 10000-person spacestation envisioned a future  base launching 600 times its own mass in lunar material cumulatively over years architecture

canceled projects 

   mol  project which was to employ elements of existing  craft it was canceled in 1969 about a year before the first planned test flight  this was unusual in being an explicitly military project as opposed to the soviet  program which was heavily intertwined with and concealed by the contemporaneous salyut program

a second skylab unit   was manufactured as a backup article  due to the high costs of providing launch vehicles and a desire by nasa to cease saturn and apollo operations in time to prepare for the  coming into service it was never flown the hull can now be seen in the  in washington dc a number of additional  were produced as backups or as flight articles that were later canceled the u.s  program which despite being under development for ten years was never launched instead evolving into the international space station
the soviet russian  station which was never constructed had some of its elements incorporated into the international space station the  was a station proposed in the 1980s that was to be privately funded the project was canceled when the company created to build it  was unable to secure funding from the  

the european  project planned to create a small space station serviced by the  shuttle it evolved into the iss  module  a company based in the isle of man was developing a reusable space vehicle and a space station based on old soviet  almaz  technology for flight in the early 2010s in march 2016 plans were announced to have the equipment converted into an educational exhibit owing to lack of funds

in april 2008 the  proposed the construction of an  for spacecraft too heavy to launch from earth directly it would not begin construction or be finished until after the decommissioning of the international space station this plan was described to iss partners by  june 17 2009 

the  is a project of a  corporation  orbital technologies  the css is intended to accommodate diverse functions such as 

enabling space-based microgravity research providing a destination for commercial human spaceflight space tourism and state sponsored human spaceflight programs acting as a backup and emergency safe haven for the international space station and its crew enabling product development facilitating satellite servicing and maintenance providing a staging outpost for human space flight missions beyond low arth orbit supplying a uniquely capable remote sensing platform 






proposed exploration gateway platform at eml-1


the business arrangement for developing and marketing the station was recently clarified by  firm  who is collaborating to develop the station with the   rsc energia
