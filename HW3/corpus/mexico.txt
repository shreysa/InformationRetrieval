mexico is ethnically diverse  with people of several ethnicities being united under a single national identity the core part of mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis of cultures primarily european culture and indigenous cultures in a process known as  mexican politicians and reformers such as   promoter of the   and   promoter of   were instrumental in building a mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje the large majority of mexicans have historically been classified as   in modern mexican usage the term mestizo is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity it was during the colonial era resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes being classified under the same identity regardless of wheter they are of mixed ancestry or not since the term carries a variety of different socio-cultural economic racial and biological meanings it was deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification thus it was abandoned by the government and is not in wide use in mexican society although it s often used in literature about mexican social identities and on intellectual circles in the yucatn peninsula the word mestizo has historically had a different meaning being used to refer to thespeaking populations living in traditional communities because during the  of the late 19th century those maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos in chiapas the word  ladino  is used instead of mestizo according to  racially mestizo mexicans make up 50 to 67 of the country s population the total percentage of mexico s population who is  varies considerably depending of the criteria used by the government on its censuses  it is 5.4 if the hability to speak an indigenous language is used as the criteria to define a person as indigenous if racial self-identification is used it s 14.9 and if people who considers themselves part indigenous are also included it amounts to 21.5 nonetheless all the censuses conclude that the majority of mexico s indigenous population is concentrated in the southern and south-eastern mexican states primarily in rural areas some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of  usos y costumbres  which allows them to regulate some internal issues under  according to the  the states with the greatest proportion of indigenous residents are  yucatn at 59 quintana roo 39 and campeche 27 chiefly   oaxaca with 48 of the population the most numerous groups being the  and   chiapas at 28 the majority being  and  maya  hidalgo 24

numbers of the indigenous population growing but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples in regards to total population is nonetheless falling all of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average in all states indigenous people have higher  in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations literacy rates are also much lower with 27 of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12 the indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average starting earlier and continuing longer however 55 of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary compared to 20 for the national average many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing similarly to mestizo and indigenous peoples estimations for the percentage of  within the mexican population vary considerably  their numbers range from around 10%20 according to the encyclopdia britannica to as high as 47 according to a nationwide survey conducted by mexico s government made with the intent of having a precise outlook of the social and economic inequalities that exist between light skinned european looking mexicans and indigenous or african looking mexicans is the first time the mexican government has conducted an official population study that referenced mexico s white population in nearly a century while during the colonial era most of the european migration into mexico was  in the 19th and 20th centuries a substantial number of non-spanish europeans immigrated to the country according to 20th and 21st century academics large scale intermixing between european immigrants and native indigenous peoples would produce a mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of mexico s population by the time of the  however according to church registers from the colonial times the majority of european men married with european women said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics such as european migrants who arrived to mexico being almost exclusively men nowadays mexicos northern and western regions have the highest european populations with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly european ancestry the  population  1,381,853 individuals as of 2015  is an ethnic group made up of descendants of colonial-era slaves and recent immigrants of sub-saharan african descent mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period and some 200,000 africans were taken there primarily in the 17th century the creation of a national mexican identity especially after the mexican revolution emphasized mexico s indigenous and european past  it passively eliminated the african ancestors and contributions most of the african-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding mestizo  mixed european indigenous  and indigenous populations through unions among the groups evidence of this long history of intermarriage with mestizo and indigenous mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census 64.9  896,829  of afro-mexicans also identified as indigenous it was also reported that 9.3 of afro-mexicans speak an indigenous language the states with the highest self-report of afro-mexicans were guerrero  6.5 of the population  oaxaca  4.95  and veracruz  3.28  afro-mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the  and  during the early 20th century a substantial number of   mostly   began arriving from the crumbling  the largest group were the lebanese and an estimated 400,000 mexicans have some  smaller ethnic groups in mexico include  present since the colonial era during the colonial era asians were termed chino  regardless of ethnicity  and arrived as merchants artisans and slaves the largest group were filipinos and some 200,000 mexicans can trace  modern asian immigration began in the late 19th century and at one point in the early 20th century the  were the second largest immigrant group official censuses
the first census in mexico that included an ethnic classification was the 1793 census also known as the revillagigedo census it was mexico s  then known as   first national population census most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as prussian geographer  while every author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country they don t seem to vary much with europeans ranging from 18 to 22 of new spain s population mestizos ranging from 21 to 25 indians ranging from 51 to 61 and africans being between 6,000 and 10,000 the estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354 it is concluded then that across nearly three centuries of colonization the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%17 per century the authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates the reason for the indigenous population s numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the spanish colonists or being at war with them anthropologist  goes beyond said numbers and splits the mestizo group into  euromestizos   indomestizos  and  afromestizos  calculating their numbers on more than one million 700,000 and 600,000 respectively independent-era mexico eliminated the legal basis of the  which led to exclude racial classification in the censuses to come according to mexico s second census ever which considered race made right after the mexican revolution on 1921 59 of mexico s population was mestizo 29 was indigenous and only 9 was european with mestizos being the most numerous ethno-racial group in almost all the states for a long time this census  results have been taken as fact with extraofficial international publications such as  and  using them as a reference to estimate mexico s racial composition up to this day however in recent time mexican academics have subjected the census  results to scrutiny claiming that such a drastic alteration on demographic trends in regards to the 1793 census is not possible and cite among other statistics the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent mexico said authors claim that the mexican society went through a  more cultural than biological mestizaje process  sponsored by the state on its efforts to unify the mexican population which resulted on the inflation of the percentage of the mestizo mexican group at the expense of the identity of the other races that exist in mexico in recent times the mexican government has decided to conduct ethnic surveys and censuses again and has also widen the criteria to classify the ethnicies who were already considered an example being the indigenous mexican classification which was previously reserved to people who lived in indigenous communities and or spoke an indigenous language according to these recent surveys indigenous peoples amount to 21.5 of mexico s population  including people who declared to be partially indigenous  afro-mexicans are 1.2 of mexico s population  including people who declared to be partially african  and european mexicans amount to 47 of mexico s population  based on appearance rather than on self-declared of ancestry  less numerous groups in mexico such as asians and middle easterners are also accounted for albeit their numbers do not vary significantly from previous estimations out of all the ethnic groups that have recently been surveyed that of mestizos is notably absent which may be consequence of the ethnic label s fluid and subjective definition which complicates a precise calculation as well the tendency that mexicans have to identify people with  static  ethnic labels rather than  fluid  ones languages
