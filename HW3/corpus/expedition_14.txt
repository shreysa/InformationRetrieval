mission highlights
the first crew of expedition 14 launched alongside spaceflight participant  in  from baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan aboard a soyuz rocket at 04 10 on 18 september 2006 cosmonaut tyurin piloted the capsule in for a perfect docking two days later at 05 21utc on 20 september with the hatch to the iss opening at 08 30utc the members of expedition 14  along with ansari  were greeted warmly by  crew pavel vinogradov   jeff williams and also by the third member of their own expedition esa astronaut thomas reiter who officially switched from a member of  to membership of expedition 14 when his soyuz seat-liner was switched atlantis reentry 
the day after docking with the expedition crew working joint operations with  the iss was positioned in such a way that the station s inhabitants were able to observe the re-entry of  at the end of  as they watched atlantis create a glowing contrail during its plunge into the atmosphere lpez-alegra and williams provided commentary of the re-entry to the mission control center in houston the station was a few hundred miles ahead of the shuttle at the time eva 1 
the expedition s first  took place on 22 november 2006 starting at 19 17   23 17   having been delayed from its scheduled 18 00 est  20 00 utc  start time due to a cooling issue in tyurin s suit tyurin got out of the suit and straightened a suspect hose which apparently had become kinked during the spacewalk tyurin  from the exterior of the  airlock this  experiment  was sponsored by a toronto-based commercial company  which manufactures golf clubs made of  the ball weighs just 3grams compared with 48grams for a standard golf ball at that weight it was unlikely to damage any station components which might accidentally have been hit there were three balls allowing two options for repeating the shot if required but only one shot was actually taken taken with a one-handed grip by tyurin  with lpez-alegra stabilising tyurin by holding his legs  the shot was a substantial slice with the ball flying off to the right of the station instead of the rear in 2006 there were plans for the video from the shot to be used in a tv commercial the progress of the ball which contains tracking equipment could be followed on  web site which was set up in 2006 although the site simply calculates an assumed distance of the ball based on a constant speed and does not perform any real tracking of the ball the stunt was carried out around 35 years after  hit two golf balls on the moon during  



commander   left  and cosmonaut  conduct pre-spacewalk operations in the  airlock  february 2007 


inspection of a kurs antenna on the  23 unpiloted cargo carrier that docked at the aft end of the station s  on 26 october 2006 was the next task final latching of the spacecraft to the station during the docking procedure was delayed by more than three hours because mission control moscow was not sure the antenna was completely retracted tyurin and lpez-alegra moved to the rear of zvezda and photographed the antenna it was still fully extended so tyurin used a screwdriver to release a latch and tried to retract the antenna russian flight controllers also tried to retract it by activating a motor neither succeeded and the task was abandoned next they relocated a wal antenna which was later used to guide the unpiloted european cargo carrier the  when it docked with the station the first atv  eventually docked with the iss on 3 april 2008 in its previous position the antenna interfered with a cover for a zvezda booster engine then the two installed a btn neutron experiment which characterises charged and neutral particles in low earth orbit atop zvezda its readings during solar bursts continue to be of special interest to scientists as of 2010 two thermal covers from the btn were jettisoned before the spacewalkers returned to the  airlock at 00 55 est  04 55 utc  on the morning of 23 november bringing the 5-hour 38-minute eva to a close  a final scheduled task an inspection of bolts on one of two strela hand-operated cranes on the docking compartment was postponed to a future eva conclusion 
this mission was the longest expedition to the iss thus far also the soyuz capsule was the oldest one ever used lpez-alegra already the u.s recordholder for spacewalks now also holds the record for longest spaceflight by a nasa astronaut spacewalks 
there were five spacewalks conducted during expedition 14 totaling 33 hours and 42 minutes  participated in all five space walks while  took part in three and  participated in 2 lpez-alegra s five spacewalks set a record for eva s during an iss mission this was matched by  during  who also performed five spacewalks note   indicates a spacewalk conducted from the  airlock
