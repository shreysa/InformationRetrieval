expedition 1 was the first long-duration stay on the   iss  the three-person crew stayed aboard the station for 136 days from november 2000 to march 2001 it was the beginning of an uninterrupted human presence on the station which continues as of november 2017  which also had three crew members immediately followed expedition 1 the official start of the expedition occurred when the crew docked to the station on 2 november 2000 aboard the russian spacecraft  which had launched two days earlier during their mission the expedition 1 crew activated various systems on board the station unpacked equipment that had been delivered and hosted three visiting space shuttle crews and two unmanned russian  the crew was very busy throughout the mission which was declared a success the three visiting space shuttles brought equipment supplies and key components of the space station the first of these  docked in early december 2000 and brought the first pair of large  which increased the station s power capabilities fivefold the second visiting shuttle mission was  which was docked in mid-february 2001 delivered the us 1.4billion research module  which increased the mass of the station beyond that of  for the first time mid-march 2001 saw the final shuttle visit of the expedition  whose main purpose was to exchange the expedition 1 crew with the next three-person long-duration crew  the expedition ended when  undocked from the station on 18 march 2001 the expedition 1 crew consisted of an american commander and two russians the commander  had been in space three times before all on shuttle missions which lasted at most a week the russians  and  both had previous long-duration spaceflights on mir with krikalev having spent over a full year in space

crew 

the commander  was a former  whose only  were on shuttle missions and at the beginning of the mission his total time in space was about two weeks questions had been raised by the russian space agency about the choice of shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience flight engineer  had spent over a year in orbit mostly on mir and would become the first person to visit the iss twice he had felt excitement to have been one of the first people to enter the  module  the first component of the space station  in 1998 during  and was looking forward to returning  was designated commander and pilot of the two-day soyuz mission to the station had one previous spaceflight which was a 180-day stay aboard  shepherd was only the second u.s astronaut to be launched in a russian spacecraft the first being  who launched on  to visit mir in 1995 shepherd expected one of the biggest challenges for the iss would be the compatibility of technologies such as that between russian and u.s technologies backup crew
the first component of the space station was the  module which was launched unmanned in november 1998 following this launch and prior to expedition 1 there were  and  to the iss some of these flights delivered  such as the pressurized  and  modules and the first piece of the  the manned flights were used for partial assembly of the iss as well as to start unpacking the supplies and equipment that were being delivered prior to expedition 1 krikalev expected the iss to be very similar to his experience on mir ten years previous due to the physical similarities of the stations  components the launch of the expedition 1 crew occurred a week before the  so it got little attention in the united states at the time of the mission the station was expected to be completed in 2006 and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015 due to several delays including the fallout from the  the station was completed in late 2011 thanks to  mission highlights 
the crew of three were on board the international space station for four and a half months from early november 2000 to mid-march 2001 major events during this time include the three-week-long  visits which occurred in early december mid-february and at the end of the expedition in march launch and docking

the three-member expedition 1 crew successfully launched on 31 october 2000 at 07 52  atop a  rocket on  from the  in   they used launch pad  from which the first human to fly in space  was launched in 1961 after 33 orbits of the earth and a series of rendezvous maneuvers performed by gidzenko they docked the soyuz capsule to the aft port of the  on 2 november 2000 at 09 21 utc ninety minutes after docking shepherd opened the hatch to zvezda and the crew members entered the complex alpha
at the end of the first day on the station shepherd requested the use of the radio call sign  alpha  which he and krikalev preferred it to the more cumbersome  international space station  the name  alpha  had previously been used for the station in the early 90 s and following the request its use was authorized for the whole of expedition 1 shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time referencing a  in a pre-launch news conference he had said   for thousands of years humans have been going to sea in ships people have designed and built these vessels launched them with a good feeling that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage   the president of  at the time disapproved of the name  alpha  he felt that mir was the first space station and so he would have preferred the names  beta  or  mir 2  for the iss first month 




the configuration of the iss at the start of expedition 1 from top to bottom the three modules are    and  

in their first weeks on board the expedition 1 crew members activated critical life support systems and computer control as well as unpacked supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions at this time the station did not have enough electricity to heat all three pressurized modules so  was left unused and unheated unity had been used for the past two years to allow u.s flight controllers to command iss systems and read station system data the russian unmanned resupply spacecraft  docked to the station on 18 november the  spacecraft s automatic docking system failed necessitating a manual docking controlled by gidzenko using the  docking system although manual dockings are routine they have caused some concern among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 which resulted in the spacecraft colliding with mir causing significant damage the astronauts had a heavy workload in the first month as shepherd told reporters in a space-to-ground interview   to me the biggest challenge is trying to pack 30 hours into an 18-hour work day  some of the early tasks took longer than scheduled for example the activation of a food warmer in zvezda s galley was scheduled for 30 minutes but it took the astronauts a day and a half to turn it on sts-97

 docked with the iss on 2 december 2000 on mission  bringing four more americans and a canadian temporarily to the station the shuttle also brought the first pair of u.s provided  which would provide  for further development of the station in total sts-97 brought 17tons of equipment to the iss which also included expandable metal girders batteries electronics and cooling equipment three  were conducted by the crew of sts-97 all of which were completed prior to opening the hatch between shuttle and station on 8 december the hatch between the two was opened and the two crews greeted each other for the first time it had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures the expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle which was thought to be good for their psychological well-being progress m1-4
prior to endeavour docking the russian resupply spacecraft  which came to the station in mid-november was undocked to make room for the space shuttle this progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of sts-97 parked in orbit about a mile away from the station it docked manually again with the station on 26 december by gidzenko after endeavour left the automatic docking system for this progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in november the crew spent much of the following week unloading the progress spacecraft christmas and new year
on christmas day the expedition 1 crew were given the day off work they opened presents delivered by endeavour and the progress supply ship they also each took turns speaking to their families in the following days they did several video  some with russian tv stations the crew had a quiet new year citing a naval tradition for the new year s entry of the station s log shepherd provided a poem on behalf of the crew sts-98

on 9 february 2001 space shuttle  docked to the iss bringing the five american crew members of  temporarily to the station the mission was originally planned for mid-january but was delayed due to nasa s concerns about some cables on the shuttles this mission brought the u.s built  which has a mass of 16  it was installed with the use of the shuttle s robotic  controlled by  astronauts  and  helped with the installation during a spacewalk the destiny module had a cost of us 1.4billion and would be used primarily for scientific research during the spacewalk an  coolant leak created a contamination scare which happened when curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to destiny the other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems while the shuttle was docked the control of the station s orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes which had been installed in september 2000 the gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics by the end of sts-98 the crew of expedition 1 had been on the station for over three months and shepherd stated that he was  ready to come home  nasa used several techniques to prevent the three crew members from suffering the effects of the  three-month wall  psychological barrier which had caused depression in previous astronauts for example they allowed more time for the crew to speak to their families via videophone and they also encouraged them to watch movies and listen to music they like progress m-44
on 28 february the third  to visit the iss  docked to the zvezda module it brought air food rocket fuel and other equipment it remained docked until  when it was intentionally burnt up during  like all  sts-102

space shuttle  docked on 10 march 2001 bringing to the iss the new long-duration three-person crew of  as well as four short-term crew members of  a few hours after docking the hatch opened and all ten astronauts greeted each other setting a new record for the number people simultaneously in the iss the day after docking american astronauts  and  began a spacewalk which ended up being nearly nine hours long and still holds the record for the longest spacewalk ever performed as of august 2010 the length of the spacewalk was partially due to some mistakes including voss accidentally releasing a small tool unable to retrieve it nasa engineers tracked the tool and decided to use discovery s thrusters on 14 march to boost the station four kilometers higher to ensure the iss would not collide with the piece of  transferring expedition crews
by 14 march the expedition crews had completed the change over but until the shuttle undocked shepherd officially remained commander of the station the morning of the 14th the astronauts  wake-up call was the song   by  at the request of shepherd s wife shepherd a former  said during the change over ceremony   may the good will spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure sail her well  the commander of discovery  said  for captain shepherd and his crew we hold you in admiration as we prepare to bring you home this has been an arduous duty for you this ship was not built in a safe harbor it was built on the high seas 
undocking and landing 
the crew s four and a half-month tour aboard the iss officially ended on 18 march 2001 when discovery undocked the expedition 1 crew returned home to earth on  landing on 21 march 2001 on a rare night landing at 2 30am local time two days after the landing coincidentally  was intentionally burned up during  ending its 15 years in orbit daily activities 
in a typical day each crew member divided his time between physical exercise station assembly and maintenance experiments communications with ground personnel personal time and bio-needs activities  such as rest and eating  the crew s daily schedule usually operated on utc  for example a typical morning had been scheduled to begin with an electronic wake-up tone at about 05 00 utc but during the expedition a more typical wake-up time was actually between 06 00 and 07 00 utc the crew s sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles following the wake-up call the crew was given some time to clean up have breakfast and read e-mail which had been  to them from flight controllers their work day included a lunch break at midday  utc  and ended with a mid-afternoon planning session with flight controllers regarding the next day s activities most days ended with some entertainment with the crew watching all or part of a movie  this was thought to be good for crew bonding as well as their psychological well-being after watching  the sequel to  shepherd commented   something strange about watching a movie about a space expedition when you re actually on a space expedition  an important part of the crew s schedule was regular exercise they had three pieces of equipment for this  a  a treadmill   and a resistance device  ired  for weight-lifting the bicycle malfunctioned in mid-december 2000 and wasn t fixed until march the treadmill which used  to keep the crew member in place was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running a normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board the treadmill malfunctioned near the end of february but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week ground communications 




 in the zvezda service module communicates with ground controllers


until the unity module was available for use a month into the mission the astronauts used the russian  communications gear  also called the  regul radio link  in zvezda and the zarya module to communicate with the russian mission control center  known as  tsup  in korolev outside moscow the russian technology didn t have the use of satellites so they were restricted to ground passes  called a  comm pass  which lasted for only 1020 minutes with the arrival of the solar arrays on  they activated the s-band early communication gear in the  allowing for more continuous communication with mission control in houston via nasa s network of  during  in september 2000 the equipment for a  was delivered to the station the first  ham  contact with the ground by the expedition 1 crew was on 13 november 2000 on a pass over moscow shortly followed by contact with  in  the crew reported that  voice quality of ham radio continues to be well above any of our other links 
the  project had the crew of the station to make brief windows to radio contact with schools and clubs on the ground the first school to be contacted by the iss was  school in southwest  the contact had been planned for 19 december 2000 but due to technical problems it was delayed to 21 december 2000 due to the speed of the space station the window of radio contact only lasted for 510 minutes which was usually enough for 10 to 20 questions science activities 
main article  
unlike subsequent expeditions the crew of expedition 1 had a somewhat modest amount of science experiments to conduct due to the priority placed on station construction the plasma crystal experiment known as pke-nefedov was one of the first  experiments conducted on the space station it was a collaboration between the  in  and the   part of the   



on 23 january 2001 the crew photographed a plume of volcanic ash from    

like previous missions the astronauts took many photos of earth from the station over 700 in total which have been made freely available these crew earth observations are intended to record dynamic events on the earth s surface such as storms fires or  for example a photo from 1 january 2001 shows   with a plume of smoke prior to its eruption the following month on 23 january 2001 the crew observed a unique perspective of a plume of volcanic ash coming from  an active volcano 70 kilometres southeast of  an example of a low-maintenance experiment was the  experiment which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions the goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the earth and hence allowing for a more accurate model of  of the 23 proteins and  attempted during expedition 1 only four resulted in successful crystallizations which was a lower success rate than predicted of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener  whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than earth-grown crystal which resulted in a more accurate protein structure model another research activity was measuring the crew s heart rates and the station s carbon dioxide levels to determine the effect of exercise on the station imax filming 
throughout the mission the expedition 1 crew filmed footage for use in the  documentary film  highlights of the footage include the first entry into the destiny module during sts-98  the expedition 1 crew showering and shaving in   and the docking of sts-102 followed by the change over to the expedition 2 crew references
