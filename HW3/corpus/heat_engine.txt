in  a heat engine is a system that converts heat or and to  which can then be used to do  it does this by bringing a working substance from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature a heat  source  generates thermal energy that brings the working substance to the high temperature state the working substance generates work in the   of the engine while  to the colder   until it reaches a low temperature state during this process some of the thermal energy is converted into  by exploiting the properties of the working substance the working substance can be any system with a non-zero  but it usually is a gas or liquid during this process a lot of heat is lost to the surroundings i.e it cannot be used in general an  converts energy to mechanical  heat engines distinguish themselves from other types of engines by the fact that their efficiency is fundamentally limited by  although this efficiency limitation can be a drawback an advantage of heat engines is that most forms of energy can be easily converted to heat by processes like   such as combustion   of light or energetic particles   and  since the heat source that supplies thermal energy to the engine can thus be powered by virtually any kind of energy heat engines are very versatile and have a wide range of applicability heat engines are often confused with the cycles they attempt to implement typically the term  engine  is used for a physical device and  cycle  for the model

in  heat engines are often modeled using a standard engineering model such as the  the theoretical model can be refined and augmented with actual data from an operating engine using tools such as an  since very few actual implementations of heat engines exactly match their underlying thermodynamic cycles one could say that a thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of a mechanical engine in any case fully understanding an engine and its efficiency requires gaining a good understanding of the  possibly simplified or idealized  theoretical model the practical nuances of an actual mechanical engine and the discrepancies between the two in general terms the larger the difference in temperature between the hot source and the cold sink the larger is the potential  of the cycle on earth the cold side of any heat engine is limited to being close to the ambient temperature of the environment or not much lower than 300  so most efforts to improve the thermodynamic efficiencies of various heat engines focus on increasing the temperature of the source within material limits the maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine  which no engine ever attains  is equal to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends divided by the temperature at the hot end all expressed as   in   the efficiency of various heat engines proposed or used today has a large range

60 for a steam-cooled   

all these processes gain their efficiency  or lack thereof  from the temperature drop across them significant energy may be used for auxiliary equipment such as pumps which effectively reduces efficiency power 
heat engines can be characterized by their  which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of   in the u.s also  per cubic inch  the result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine this is not to be confused with  since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel-air ratio and thus lower power density a modern high-performance car engine makes in excess of 75kw l  1.65hp in3  everyday examples 
examples of everyday heat engines include the  and the  the  is also heat engine as well as the  toy all of these heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases the general surroundings are the heat sink which provides relatively cool gases that when heated expand rapidly to drive the mechanical motion of the engine examples of heat engines 
it is important to note that although some cycles have a typical combustion location  internal or external  they often can be implemented with the other for example  developed an external heated engine running on a cycle very much like the earlier  in addition externally heated engines can often be implemented in open or closed cycles earth s heat engine

main article  
a domestic  is an example of a   a heat engine in reverse work is used to create a heat differential many cycles can run in reverse to move heat from the cold side to the hot side making the cold side cooler and the hot side hotter internal combustion engine versions of these cycles are by their nature not reversible refrigeration cycles include 








evaporative heat engines 
the  is a heat engine based on a cycle producing power and cooled moist air from the evaporation of water into hot dry air mesoscopic heat engines 
mesoscopic heat engines are nanoscale devices that may serve the goal of processing heat fluxes and perform useful work at small scales potential applications include e.g electric cooling devices in such mesoscopic heat engines work per cycle of operation fluctuates due to thermal noise there is exact equality that relates average of exponents of work performed by any heat engine and the heat transfer from the hotter heat bath this relation transforms the carnot s inequality into exact equality efficiency 
the efficiency of a heat engine relates how much useful work is output for a given amount of heat energy input from the laws of  after a completed cycle 


where
 is the work extracted from the engine  it is negative since work is done by the engine 
 is the heat energy taken from the high temperature system  it is negative since heat is extracted from the source hence  is positive 
 is the heat energy delivered to the cold temperature system  it is positive since heat is added to the sink 

in other words a heat engine absorbs heat energy from the high temperature heat source converting part of it to useful work and delivering the rest to the cold temperature heat sink in general the efficiency of a given heat transfer process  whether it be a refrigerator a heat pump or an engine  is defined informally by the ratio of  what you get out  to  what you put in  in the case of an engine one desires to extract work and puts in a heat transfer 


the theoretical maximum efficiency of any heat engine depends only on the temperatures it operates between this efficiency is usually derived using an ideal imaginary heat engine such as the  although other engines using different cycles can also attain maximum efficiency mathematically this is because in  processes the change in  of the cold reservoir is the negative of that of the hot reservoir  i.e   keeping the overall change of entropy zero thus 



where  is the  of the hot source and  that of the cold sink usually measured in  note that  is positive while  is negative  in any reversible work-extracting process entropy is overall not increased but rather is moved from a hot  high-entropy  system to a cold  low-entropy one  decreasing the entropy of the heat source and increasing that of the heat sink the reasoning behind this being the maximal efficiency goes as follows it is first assumed that if a more efficient heat engine than a carnot engine is possible then it could be driven in reverse as a heat pump mathematical analysis can be used to show that this assumed combination would result in a net decrease in  since by the  this is statistically improbable to the point of exclusion the carnot efficiency is a theoretical upper bound on the reliable efficiency of any process empirically no heat engine has ever been shown to run at a greater efficiency than a carnot cycle heat engine figure 2 and figure 3 show variations on carnot cycle efficiency figure 2 indicates how efficiency changes with an increase in the heat addition temperature for a constant compressor inlet temperature figure 3 indicates how the efficiency changes with an increase in the heat rejection temperature for a constant turbine inlet temperature 
endoreversible heat engines 
the most carnot efficiency as a criterion of heat engine performance is the fact that by its nature any maximally efficient carnot cycle must operate at an infinitesimal temperature gradient this is because any transfer of heat between two bodies at differing temperatures is irreversible and therefore the carnot efficiency expression only applies in the infinitesimal limit the major problem with that is that the object of most heat engines is to output some sort of power and infinitesimal power is usually not what is being sought a different measure of ideal heat engine efficiency is given by considerations of  where the cycle is identical to the carnot cycle except in that the two processes of heat transfer are not reversible  callen 1985

heat engines have been known since antiquity but were only made into useful devices at the time of the industrial revolution in the 18th century they continue to be developed today heat engine enhancements 
engineers have studied the various heat engine cycles extensively in effort to improve the amount of usable work they could extract from a given power source the carnot cycle limit cannot be reached with any gas-based cycle but engineers have worked out at least two ways to possibly go around that limit and one way to get better efficiency without bending any rules 
increase the temperature difference in the heat engine the simplest way to do this is to increase the hot side temperature which is the approach used in modern combined-cycle  unfortunately physical limits  such as the melting point of the materials used to build the engine  and environmental concerns regarding  production restrict the maximum temperature on workable heat engines modern gas turbines run at temperatures as high as possible within the range of temperatures necessary to maintain acceptable nox output  another way of increasing efficiency is to lower the output temperature one new method of doing so is to use mixed chemical working fluids and then exploit the changing behavior of the mixtures one of the most famous is the so-called  which uses a 70 30 mix of  and water as its working fluid this mixture allows the cycle to generate useful power at considerably lower temperatures than most other processes exploit the physical properties of the working fluid the most common such exploitation is the use of water above the so-called critical point or so-called supercritical steam the behavior of fluids above their critical point changes radically and with materials such as water and  it is possible to exploit those changes in behavior to extract greater thermodynamic efficiency from the heat engine even if it is using a fairly conventional brayton or rankine cycle a newer and very promising material for such applications is   and  have also been considered for such applications although so2 is toxic exploit the chemical properties of the working fluid a fairly new and novel exploit is to use exotic working fluids with advantageous chemical properties one such is   no2  a toxic component of smog which has a natural  as di-nitrogen tetraoxide  n2o4  at low temperature the n2o4 is compressed and then heated the increasing temperature causes each n2o4 to break apart into two no2 molecules this lowers the molecular weight of the working fluid which drastically increases the efficiency of the cycle once the no2 has expanded through the turbine it is cooled by the  which makes it recombine into n2o4 this is then fed back by the compressor for another cycle such species as   al2br6  nocl and ga2i6 have all been investigated for such uses to date their drawbacks have not warranted their use despite the efficiency gains that can be realized 
heat engine processes 

each process is one of the following 

  at constant temperature maintained with heat added or removed from a heat source or sink 
  at constant pressure 
  at constant volume  also referred to as iso-volumetric
  no heat is added or removed from the system during adiabatic process 
  reversible adiabatic process no heat is added or removed during isentropic process

 fundamentals of classical thermodynamics 3rd ed p 159  1985  by g j van wylen and r e sonntag   a heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high body and to a low-temperature body often the term heat engine is used in a broader sense to include all devices that produce work either through heat transfer or combustion even though the device does not operate in a thermodynamic cycle the internal-combustion engine and the gas turbine are examples of such devices and calling these heat engines is an acceptable use of the term

 thermal physics  entropy and free energies by joon chang lee  2002  appendix a p 183   a heat engine absorbs energy from a heat source and then converts it into work for us when the engine absorbs heat energy the absorbed heat energy comes with entropy   heat energy    when the engine performs work on the other hand no entropy leaves the engine this is problematic we would like the engine to repeat the process again and again to provide us with a steady work source  to do so the working substance inside the engine must return to its initial thermodynamic condition after a cycle which requires to remove the remaining entropy the engine can do this only in one way it must let part of the absorbed heat energy leave without converting it into work therefore the engine cannot convert all of the input energy into work
