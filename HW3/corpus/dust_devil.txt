in the southwestern united states a dust devil is sometimes called a  dancing devil  in  california it may be called a  sand auger  or a  dust whirl  the  refer to them as  ghosts or spirits of dead navajos if a chindi spins clockwise it is said to be a good spirit  if it spins counterclockwise it is said to be a bad spirit 
the  term  willy-willy  or  whirly-whirly  is thought to derive from  or a neighbouring language in aboriginal myths willy-willies represent spirit forms parents may warn their children that if they misbehave a spirit will emerge from the spinning vortex of dirt and chastise them there is a story of the origin of the  in which a bad spirit descends from the sky and captures the young being and abducts her by taking the form of a willy-willy 
in    and  dust devils often reach hundreds of meters in height  and are referred to as   genies  or  devils  
 has its fasset el  afreet or  ghost s wind  in  this kind of wind is usually called  gerd baad  or  round wind  among the  of  the dust devil is known as ngoma cia aka meaning  women s devil demon  
in  a dust devil is called redemoinho after moinho de vento   in some traditions it contains a dancing  also sometimes it is associated to local religion and beliefs in  it is known locally as remoinho  translated to continuous rotation  
in the us when they occur in cities or urban scenes they are sometimes called  nevada tornadoes  or  chicago tornadoes  because of chicago s  despite dust devils being rare in chicago 



a dust devil in   

dust devils form when hot air near the surface rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler low-pressure air above it if conditions are just right the air may begin to rotate as the air rapidly rises the column of hot air is stretched vertically thereby moving mass closer to the axis of rotation which causes intensification of the spinning effect by  the  in the dust devil causes other hot air to speed horizontally inward to the bottom of the newly forming vortex as more hot air rushes in toward the developing vortex to replace the air that is rising the spinning effect becomes further intensified and self-sustaining a dust devil fully formed is a funnel-like chimney through which hot air moves both upwards and in a circle as the hot air rises it cools loses its buoyancy and eventually ceases to rise as it rises it displaces air which descends outside the core of the vortex this cool air returning acts as a balance against the spinning hot-air outer wall and keeps the system stable the spinning effect along with surface  usually will produce a forward momentum the dust devil is able to sustain itself longer by moving over nearby sources of hot surface air as available extreme hot air near the surface is channeled up the dust devil eventually surrounding cooler air will be sucked in once this occurs the effect is dramatic and the dust devil dissipates in seconds usually this occurs when the dust devil is not moving fast enough  depletion  or begins to enter a terrain where the surface temperatures are cooler causing unbalance certain conditions increase the likelihood of dust devil formation 
flat barren terrain desert or tarmac  flat conditions increase the likelihood of the hot-air  fuel  being a near constant dusty or sandy conditions will cause particles to become caught up in the vortex making the dust devil easily visible clear skies or lightly cloudy conditions  the surface needs to absorb significant amounts of  to heat the air near the surface and create ideal dust devil conditions light or no wind and cool atmospheric temperature  the underlying factor for sustainability of a dust devil is the extreme difference in temperature between the near-surface air and the atmosphere windy conditions will destabilize the spinning effect  like a   of a dust devil 
intensity and duration 






on earth most dust devils are very small and weak often less than 3feet  0.9m  in diameter with maximum winds averaging about 45miles per hour  70km h  and they often dissipate less than a minute after forming on rare occasions a dust devil can grow very large and intense sometimes reaching a diameter of up to 300feet  90m  with winds in excess of 60mph  100km h  and can last for upwards of 20minutes before dissipating dust devils typically do not cause injuries but rare severe dust devils have caused damage and even deaths in the past one such dust devil struck the  fairgrounds in  on september 14 2000 causing extensive damage to several temporary tents stands and booths as well as some permanent fairgrounds structures several injuries were reported but there were no fatalities based on the degree of damage left behind it is estimated that the dust devil produced winds as high as 75mph  120km h  which is equivalent to an  tornado on may 19 2003 a dust devil lifted the roof off a two-story building in  causing it to collapse and kill a man inside in east  in 2010 three children in an  were picked up by a dust devil and lifted over 10 feet  3m  traveling over a fence and landing in a backyard three houses away on december 31 2014 during the set-up for a cookoff in the  fan fest area a dust devil was caught on video no one was seriously injured hazards 
dust devils have been implicated in around 100 aircraft accidents while many incidents have been simple taxiing problems a few have had fatal consequences dust devils are also considered major hazards among  and  as they can cause a  or a glider to collapse with little to no warning at altitudes considered too low to  and contribute the serious injury or death of many parachutists health 
there is an endemic health issue in some arid areas such as the   northwestern mexico  and  called  cocci fungus grows naturally in alkaline soil and the fungus spores that lie dormant and can be picked up by dust devils are blown around when a person breathes these spores in they cause  while usually not a serious threat the disease is still dangerous to some people electrical activities 
dust devils even small ones  on earth  can produce radio noise and electrical fields greater than 10,000 volts per meter a dust devil picks up small dirt and dust particles as the particles whirl around they bump and scrape into each other and become electrically charged the whirling charged particles also create a magnetic field that fluctuates between 3 and 30 times each second these electrical fields assist the vortices in lifting materials off the ground and into the atmosphere field experiments indicate that a dust devil can lift 1gram of dust per second from each square metre  10lb s from each acre  of ground it passes over a large dust devil measuring about 100metres  330ft  across at its base can lift about 15 metric tonnes  17 short tons  of dust into the air in 30minutes giant dust storms that sweep across the world s deserts contribute 8 of the mineral dust in the atmosphere each year during the handful of storms that occur in comparison the significantly smaller dust devils that twist across the deserts during the summer lift about three times as much dust thus having a greater combined impact on the dust content of the atmosphere when this occurs they are often called sand pillars martian dust devils 
dust devils also occur on   see   and were first photographed by the  orbiters in the 1970s in 1997 the  lander detected a dust devil passing over it in the image shown here photographed by the mars global surveyor the long dark streak is formed by a moving swirling column of martian atmosphere the dust devil itself  the black spot  is climbing the crater wall the streaks on the right are sand dunes on the crater floor martian dust devils can be up to fifty times as wide and ten times as high as terrestrial dust devils and large ones may pose a threat to terrestrial technology sent to mars mission members monitoring the  on mars reported on march 12 2005 that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the solar panels of that robot power levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded a similar phenomenon  solar panels mysteriously cleaned of accumulated dust  had previously been observed with the  and dust devils had also been suspected as the cause

coal devil in 


a  or swirl sometimes called fire devils or fire tornadoes can be seen during intense fires in combustible building structures or more commonly in forest or bush fires a fire whirl is a vortex-shaped formation of burning gases being released from the combustible material the genesis of the vortex is probably similar to that of a dust devil as distinct from the dust devil it is improbable that the height reached by the fire gas vortex is greater than the visible height of the vertical flames because of turbulence in the surrounding gases that inhibit creation of a stable boundary layer between the rotating rising gases relative to the surrounding gases hot cinders underneath freshly deposited ash in recently burned areas may sometimes generate numerous dust devils the lighter weight and the darker color of the ash may create dust devils that are visible hundreds of feet into the air ash devils form similar to dust devils and are often seen on unstable days in burn scar areas of recent fires

 are phenomena often observed in the steam rising from  the same conditions can produce a snow whirlwind although differential heating is more difficult in snow-covered areas coal devils are common at the coal town of tsagaan khad in   they occur when dust devils pick up large amounts of stockpiled coal their dark color makes them resemble some tornados see also
