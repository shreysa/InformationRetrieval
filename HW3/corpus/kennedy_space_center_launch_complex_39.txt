history
northern merritt island was first developed around 1890 when a few wealthy harvard university graduates purchased 18,000 acres  73km2  and constructed a three-story mahogany clubhouse very nearly on the site of pad 39a during the 1920s peter e studebaker jr son of  built a small casino at de soto beach eight miles  13km  north of the canaveral lighthouse in 1948 the navy transferred the former banana river naval air station located south of  to the air force for use in testing captured german v-2 rockets the site s location on the east florida coast was ideal for this purpose in that launches would be over the ocean away from populated areas this site became the joint long range proving ground in 1949 and was renamed  in 1950 the air force annexed part of cape canaveral to the north in 1951 forming the air force missile test center the future   ccafs  missile and rocketry testing and development would take place here through the 1950s after the  in 1958 the ccafs launch pads were used for nasa s civilian unmanned and manned launches including those of  and  apollo and skylab

in 1961 president kennedy proposed to congress the goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade congressional approval led to the launch of the  which required a massive expansion of nasa operations including an expansion of launch operations from the cape to adjacent merritt island to the north and west nasa began acquisition of land in 1962 taking title to 131 square miles  340km2  by outright purchase and negotiating with the state of florida for an additional 87 square miles  230km2  on july 1 1962 the site was named the launch operations center initial design

warning lamps for the planned 3 pads including the unbuilt pad c




at the time the highest numbered launch pad on ccafs was launch complex 37  when the lunar launch complex was designed it was designated as launch complex 39 it was designed to handle launches of the  rocket at the time the largest most powerful rocket then designed required to take apollo to the moon initial plans included four pads  five were considered  evenly spaced 8,700 feet  2,700m  apart to avoid damage in the event of an explosion on the pad three were scheduled for construction  a-c to the southeast  and two  d and e west and north  would have been built at a later date the numbering of the pads at the time was from north to south with the northernmost being 39a and the southernmost being 39c pad 39a was never built and 39c became 39a in 1963 with today s numbering 39c would have been north of 39b and 39d would have been due west of 39c pad 39e would have been due north of the mid-distance between 39c and 39d with 39e forming the top of a triangle and equidistant from 39c and 39d the  was built with the additional pads in mind this is the reason the crawlerway turns as it heads to padb  continuing straight from that turn would have led to the additional pads integration of space vehicle stack

months before launch the three stages of the  launch vehicle and the components of the  were brought inside the vehicle assembly building  vab  and assembled in one of four high bays into a 363-foot  111mtall space vehicle on one of three  each mobile launcher consisted of a two-story 161-by-135-foot  49 by 41m  launch platform with four hold-down arms and a 446-foot  136m  launch umbilical tower  lut  topped by a crane used to lift the spacecraft into position for assembly the mlp and unfueled vehicle together weighed 12,600,000 pounds  5,715t  the umbilical tower contained two elevators and nine retractable swing arms which extended to the space vehicle to provide access to each of the three rocket stages and the spacecraft for people wiring and plumbing while the vehicle was on the launch pad and swung away from the vehicle at launch technicians engineers and astronauts used the uppermost spacecraft access arm to access the crew cabin at the end of the arm the  provided an environmentally controlled and protected area for astronauts and their equipment to enter the spacecraft transportation to the pad 
when the stack integration was completed it was moved the 34 miles  4.86.4km  to the pad at a speed of 1 mile  1.6km  per hour by one of two  each crawler weighed 6,000,000 pounds  2,720t  and was capable of keeping the space vehicle on its mobile launcher level while negotiating a 5 percent grade to the pad at the pad the mlp was supported by six steel pedestals plus four additional extensible columns mobile service structure

after the mlp was set in place the crawler-transporter rolled a 410-foot  125m  10,490,000-pound  4,760t  mobile   mss  into place to provide further access for technicians to perform detailed checkout of the vehicle and necessary umbillical connections to the pad the mss contained three elevators two self-propelled platforms and three fixed platforms and was rolled back 6,900 feet  2,100m  to its parking position shortly before launch flame deflector 
a flame deflector was slid on rails into place under the launch pedestal this system allowed for rotation with a second flame deflector after the first was refurbished after each launch each deflector measured 39 feet  12m  high by 49 feet  15m  wide by 75 feet  23m  long and weighed 1,400,000 pounds  635t  it deflected the exhaust flame into a trench measuring 43 feet  13m  deep by 59 feet  18m  wide by 449 feet  137m  long launch control and fueling 
the four-story  was located 3.5 miles  5.6km  away from pad a adjacent to the vehicle assembly building for safety the third floor had four firing rooms  corresponding to the four high bays in the vab  each with 470 sets of control and monitoring equipment  the second floor contained telemetry tracking instrumentation and data reduction computing equipment the lcc was connected to the mobile launchers by a high speed data link and during launch a system of 62 closed-circuit television cameras transmitted to 100 monitor screens in the lcc large cryogenic tanks located near the pads stored the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen  lox  for the second and third stages of the saturn v the highly explosive nature of these chemicals required numerous safety measures at the launch complex the pads were located 8,730 feet  2,660m  away from each other before tanking operations began and during launch non-essential personnel were excluded from the danger area emergency evacuation system 
each pad had a 200-foot  61m  evacuation tube running from the mobile launcher platform to a  39 feet  12m  underground equipped with survival supplies for 20 persons for 24 hours there was also a cab slidewire system running from the 322-foot  98m  tower level to evacuate astronauts and technicians 2,503 feet  763m  away from the pad pad terminal connection room 
connections between the   and space vehicle are made in the pad terminal connection room  ptcr  the facility was a two-story series of rooms beneath the launch pad constructed of reinforced concrete located on the west side of the flame trench and was protected by up to 20 feet  6.1m  of fill dirt apollo and skylab launches 




 the first unmanned test flight of the  rising from pad 39a  november 1967 



final launch of  from pad 39b carrying the  command module into orbit  july 1975 



the first use of lc-39 came in 1967 with the first saturnv launch carrying the unmanned  spacecraft the second unmanned launch  also used pad 39a with the exception of  which used pad 39b  due to the  all-up  testing resulting in a 2-month turnaround period  all manned apollo-saturnv launches commencing with  used pad 39a a total of thirteen saturn vs were launched for apollo and the unmanned launch of the  space station in 1973 the mobile launchers were then modified for the shorter  rockets by adding a  milk-stool  extension platform to the launch pedestal so that the  upper stage and apollo spacecraft swing arms would reach these were used for three manned skylab flights and the  since the saturn ib pads 34 and 37 at cape canaveral afb had been decommissioned space shuttle 
the thrust to allow the space shuttle to achieve orbit was provided by a combination of the   srbs  and the   ssmes  the srbs used solid propellant hence their name the ssmes used a combination of  and   lox  from the  et  as the orbiter did not have internal fuel tanks for the ssmes  as they would be have had to be as large as the external tank  the srbs arrived in segments via rail car from their manufacturing facility in  the external tank arrived from its manufacturing facility in  by barge and the orbiter waited in the   opf  the srbs were first stacked in the vab and then the external tank was mounted between them then using a massive crane the orbiter was lowered and connected to the external tank payload to be installed at the launch pad was independently transported in a payload transportation canister then installed vertically at the payload changeout room otherwise payloads would have already been pre-installed at the orbiter processing facility and transported within the orbiter s cargo bay the original structure of the pads was remodeled for the needs of the space shuttle starting with pad 39a after the last saturnv launch and in 1977 for pad 39b after the  in 1975 



 standing on pad 39a ready for its first orbital flight   april 1981  the rotating service structure has been rolled away in preparation for launch 

launch towers 
each pad contained a two-piece access tower system the fixed service structure  fss  and the rotating service structure  rss  the fss permitted access to the shuttle via a retractable arm and a  beanie cap  to capture vented lox from the external tank the rss contained the payload changeout room which offered  clean  access to the orbiter s payload bay protection from the elements and protection in winds up to 60 knots  110km h  sound suppression water system 
a sound suppression water system  ssws  was added to protect the space shuttle and its payload from effects of the intense sound wave pressure generated by its engines an elevated water tank on a 290-foot  88m  tower near each pad stored 300,000 gallons  1.1megalitres  of water which was released onto the mobile launcher platform just before engine ignition the water muffled the intense sound waves produced by the engines due to heating of the water a large quantity of steam was produced during launch swing arm modifications 




the doors to the white room which provided entry to the shuttle crew compartment are seen here at the end of the access arm walkway


the gaseous oxygen vent arm positioned a hood often called the  beanie cap  over the top of the external tank  et  nose cone during fueling  heated gaseous nitrogen was used there to remove the extremely cold gaseous oxygen that normally vented out of the external tank this prevented the formation of ice that could fall and damage the shuttle the hydrogen vent line access arm mated the external tank  et    gucp  to the launch pad hydrogen vent line the gucp provided support for plumbing and cables called umbilicals that transferred fluids gases and electrical signals between two pieces of equipment while the et was being fueled hazardous gas was vented from an internal hydrogen tank through the gucp out a vent line to a flare stack where it was burned off at a safe distance sensors at the gucp measured gas level the gucp was redesigned after leaks created scrubs of  and were also detected during attempts to launch  and  the gucp released from the et at launch and fell away with a curtain of water sprayed across it for protection from flames emergency pad evacuation

in an emergency the launch complex used a slidewire escape basket system for quick evacuation assisted by members of the closeout team the crew would leave the orbiter and ride an emergency basket to the ground at speeds reaching up to 55 miles per hour  89km h  from there the crew took shelter in a bunker a modified  could carry injured astronauts away from the complex to safety during the launch of discovery on  on may31 2008 the pad at lc-39a suffered extensive damage in particular to the concrete trench used to deflect the srb s flames the subsequent mishap investigation found that the damage was the result of carbonation of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors which held the  in the trench in place these had been exacerbated by the fact that  is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters space shuttle launches 
after the launch of  in 1973 pad 39a was reconfigured for the space shuttle with shuttle launches beginning in 1981 with  flown by the   after apollo10 pad 39b was kept as a backup launch facility in the case of the destruction of 39a but saw service for all three skylab missions the apollo-soyuz test flight and a contingency skylab rescue flight that never became necessary after the apollo-soyuz test project 39b was reconfigured similarly to 39a but due to additional modifications  mainly to allow the facility to service a modified  upper stage  along with budgetary restraints it was not ready until 1986 and the first shuttle flight to use it was  which ended with the  the first return to flight mission  launched from 39b constellation program and pad 39b

the last shuttle launch from pad 39b was the nighttime launch of  on december 9 2006 to support the final shuttle mission to the hubble space telescope  launched from pad 39a in may 2009  was placed on 39b if needed to launch the  rescue mission after the completion of  39b was converted for the single test flight of the constellation program  from pad 39b on october28 2009 20112013 
with the retirement of the shuttle in 2011 and the cancellation of  in 2010 the future of the lc-39 pads was uncertain by early 2011 nasa began informal discussions on use of the pads and facilities by  to fly missions for the commercial space market culminating in a 20-year lease agreement with spacex for pad 39a pad 39a 
just like the first 24 shuttle flights pad 39a supported the final manifested shuttle flights starting with  in june 2007 until the retirement of the shuttle fleet in july 2011 prior to the spacex lease agreement the pad remained as it was when atlantis launched on the final shuttle mission on july 8 2011 complete with a

talks for use of the pad were underway between nasa and the  s as early as 2011 but no deal materialized by 2012 and nasa then pursued other options for removing the pad from the federal government inventory by early 2013 nasa publicly announced that it would allow commercial launch providers to lease pad 39a and followed that in may 2013 with a formal solicitation for proposals for  of launch pad 39a there were two competing bids for the commercial use of the launch complex  submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex while    submitted a bid for shared non-exclusive use of the complex such that the launchpad would interface with multiple vehicles and costs could be shared over the long term one potential shared user in the blue origin plan was  prior to completion of the bid period and prior to any public announcement by nasa of the results of the process blue origin filed a protest with the    gao   over what it says is a plan by nasa to award an exclusive commercial lease to spacex for use of mothballed space shuttle launch pad 39a  nasa had planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by october 1 2013 but the protest  will delay any decision until the gao reaches a decision expected by mid-december  on december 12 2013 the gao denied the protest and sided with nasa which argued that the solicitation contains no preference on the use of the facility as multi-use or single-use  the  document merely asks bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility 
on december 13 2013 nasa announced that they had selected spacex as the new commercial tenant spacex signed the lease agreement on april 14 2014 they have been given a twenty-year exclusive lease of pad 39a spacex plans to launch their  and  from the pad and build a new hangar near it  ceo of spacex has stated that he wants to shift most of their nasa launches to pad 39a including  and  missions to the  current status

kennedy space center launch complex 39b


since the ares i-x flight nasa proceeded with plans to strip pad 39b of its flight service structure  fss  returning the location to an apollo-like  clean pad  design for the first time since 1977 this approach will make the pad available to multiple types of vehicles which arrive at the pad with service structures on the mobile launcher platform as opposed to custom structures on the pad the lh2 lox and water tanks  used for the sound suppression system  are the only structures left from the space shuttle era as of june 2012 repairs and modifications to selected facility systems at launch complex  lc  39b for   sls  processing and launch operations are finishing the first phase of a five-phase project the second phase of this project is currently budgeted at  89.2 million  6.1 million in fy 2012  28.5 million in fy 2013  9.4 million in fy 2014 and  45.2 million in the outyears   in march 2015 pad 39b was undergoing modifications to the catacomb roof structure so that it can handle the loads from the sls block 1b rocket increasing the load capacity to support the crawler-transporter and vertical rocket from 21,000,000 to 25,500,000 pounds  9,500,000 to 11,600,000kg  in 2014 nasa announced that it would make pad 39b available to commercial users during times when it is not needed by the space launch system as of may 2017 nasa has one sls mission scheduled in 2019 and a second one in 2021 launch pad 39c 
launch pad 39c is a new facility for  built in 2015 within the launch complex 39b perimeter construction 
construction of the pad began in january 2015 and was completed in june 2015  director  and representatives from the ground systems development and operations  gsdo  program and the center planning and development  cpd  and engineering directorates marked the completion of the new pad during a ribbon-cutting ceremony july 17 2015  as america s premier spaceport we re always looking for new and innovative ways to meet america s launch needs and one area that was missing was small class    said  using 21st century funds we built pad 39c 
gsdo oversaw the project and is working with cpd to grow commercial space efforts at kennedy  pad 39c is the latest addition to our portfolio of launch pads  said scott colloredo cpd director  the small class market is here the demand for that kind of launcher is increasing the key here is this is really what a launch site for a small class launcher needs to look like 
the concrete pad measures about 50 feet  15m  wide by about 100 feet  30m  long and could support the combined weight of a fueled   and customer-provided launch mount up to about 132,000 pounds  60,000kg  and an umbilical tower structure fluid lines cables and umbilical arms weighing up to about 47,000 pounds  21,000kg  gsdo also developed a universal propellant servicing system to provide liquid oxygen and  fueling capabilities for a variety of small class rockets  this is absolutely great to designate a new pad within the confines of pad 39b i m looking forward to having customers here in the not too distant future making use of this outstanding facility   said
