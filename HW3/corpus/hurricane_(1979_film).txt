the film is based on a 1937 film of the same name directed by  filming was entirely on location on the remote south seas island of bora bora the special effects for the hurricane were done by a team led by  who also did special effects for the 1937 film  was originally hired to direct by producer  not long after polanski s infamous arrest in 1977 while his case worked its way through the courts over many months polanski developed the script with writer  and supervised pre-production including the selection of  as a location and the construction of sets there when polanski was sent to prison for a brief period and his future became uncertain de laurentiis had to replace him with  as the film was ready and waiting to shoot the budget was  20 million troell felt that this massive budget actually made directing the film a much more difficult and unpleasant experience he later remarked that

 i think the more money the less creative freedom you ve got dino de laurentiis is a very strong producer and he knew what he wanted i knew that from the start but i didn t have a good time shooting the film because i didn t think that i was doing a good job i wanted to complicate the characters make them more interesting but when a movie costs so much a producer says you have to appeal to a common denominator dino had as his guiding light for that film the taste of a big audience  sometimes he would touch his nose and say  i can smell it  i like dino in many ways but it was difficult making that kind of movie for him the characters got lost in the special effects
