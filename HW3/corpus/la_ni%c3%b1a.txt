sea surface skin temperature anomalies in november 2007 showing la nia conditions


la nia   spanish pronunciation  is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of  as part of the broader   the name la nia originates from  meaning  the little girl  analogous to el nio meaning  the little boy  it has also in the past been called anti-el nio and el viejo  meaning  the old man  during a period of la nia the  across the equatorial eastern central  will be lower than normal by 3 to 5c in the united states an appearance of la nia persists for at least five months it has extensive effects on the weather in  even affecting the  and  seasons

definition 
la nia is the positive phase of the  and is associated with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean however each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a la nia event which is tailored to their specific interests for example the australian  looks at the trade winds soi weather models and sea surface temperatures in the nio 3 and 3.4 regions before declaring that a la nia event has started however the  declares that a la nia event has started when the average five-month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino.3 region is more than 0.5c  0.90f  cooler for 6 consecutive months or longer occurrences 


a timeline of all la nia episodes between 1900 and 2017 
there was a relatively strong la nia episode during 19881989 la nia also formed in late 1983 in 1995 and a protracted la nia event that lasted from mid-1998 through early 2001 this was followed by a neutral period between 2001 and 2002 the la nia which developed in mid-2007 and lasted until almost 2009 was a moderate one the strength of la nia made the  one of the five most active since 1944  sixteen named storms had winds of at least 39 miles per hour  63km h  eight of which became 74-mile-per-hour  119km h  or greater hurricanes a new la nia episode developed quite quickly in the eastern and central tropical pacific in mid-2010 and lasted until early 2011 it intensified again in mid-2011 and lasted until early 2012 this la nia combined with record-high ocean temperatures in the north-eastern  was a large factor in the  and the quartet of recent heavy snowstorms in north america starting with the  the same la nia event was also a likely cause of a series of tornadoes of above-average severity that struck the midwestern and southern united states in the spring of 2011 and drought conditions in the south central states including texas oklahoma and arkansas meanwhile a series of major storms caused extensive flooding in california in december 2010 with seven consecutive days of non-stop rainfall leading to one of the wettest decembers in over 120 years of records this is in contrast to the drier-than-normal conditions typically associated with la nia in california in 2011 on a global scale la nia events helped keep the average global temperature below recent trends as a result 2011 tied with 1997 for the eleventh-warmest year on record it was the second-coolest year of the 21st century to date and tied with the second-warmest year of the 20th century a relatively strong phase of la nia opened the year dissipated in the spring before re-emerging in october and lasted through the end of the year when compared to previous la nia years the 2011 global surface temperature was the warmest observed the 2011 globally-averaged precipitation over land was the second-wettest year on record behind 2010 precipitation varied greatly across the globe this la nia contributed to severe drought in  and to australia s third-wettest year in its 112-year period of records la nias occurred in 1904 1908 1910 1916 1924 1928 1938 194951 195456 1964 197072 197376 198385 198889 199596 19982001 200708 201012 and 201617 impacts on the global climate 
la nia impacts the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others regional impacts 
observations of la nia events since 1950 show that impacts associated with la nia events depend on what season it is however while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur africa 




between 50,000 and 100,000 people died during the  

la nia results in wetter-than-normal conditions in southern africa from december to february and drier-than-normal conditions over equatorial east africa over the same period asia 
during la nia years the formation of tropical cyclones along with the subtropical ridge position shifts westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to  in march 2008 la nia caused a drop in sea surface temperatures over southeast asia by 2c it also caused heavy rains over  the  and  north america 




regional impacts of la nia 

la nia causes mostly the opposite effects of el nio above-average  across the northern midwest the northern rockies northern california and the pacific northwest s southern and eastern regions meanwhile precipitation in the southwestern and southeastern states is below average this also allows for the development of many stronger-than-average hurricanes in the atlantic and fewer in the pacific the  condition for  winds is associated with  forming in  of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front which causes winds to accelerate through the  tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts between october and february with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the azores-bermuda high pressure system wind magnitude is weaker during la nia years than  years due to the less frequent cold frontal incursions during la nia winters with its effects can last from a few hours to six days in canada la nia will in general cause a cooler snowier winter such as the near-record-breaking amounts of snow recorded in la nia winter of 2007 2008 in eastern canada south america 
during a time of la nia drought plagues the coastal regions of peru and chile from december to february northern brazil is wetter than normal la nia causes higher than normal rainfall in the central andes which in turn causes catastrophic flooding on the llanos de mojos of beni department bolivia such flooding is documented from 1853 1865 1872 1873 1886 1895 1896 1907 1921 1928 1929 and 1931 diversity

the traditional la nia also called eastern pacific  ep  la nia involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific however in the last two decades nontraditional la nia were observed in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly  nio 1 and 2  is not affected but an anomaly arises in the central pacific  nio 3.4  the phenomenon is called central pacific  cp  la nia  dateline  la nia  because the anomaly arises near the   or la nia  modoki   modoki is  for  similar but different  there are flavors of enso additional to ep and cp types and some scientists argue that enso exists as a continuum often with hybrid types the effects of the cp la nia are different from those of the traditional ep la niae.g the recently discovered la nia leads to a rainfall increase over  and northern  rather than over the east as in a conventional la nia also la nia modoki increases the frequency of cyclonic storms over  but decreases the occurrence of severe storms in the  overall with the  becoming severely non-conductive to tropical cyclone formation the recent discovery of enso modoki has some scientists believing it to be linked to global warming however comprehensive satellite data go back only to 1979 generally there is no scientific consensus on how if  may affect enso there is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this  new  enso a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence or both either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches or that other types should be distinguished such as standard and extreme enso recent years when la nia modoki events occurred include 197374 197576 198384 198889 199899 200001 200809 201011 and 201617 see also
