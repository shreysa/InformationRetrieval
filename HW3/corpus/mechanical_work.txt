in  a  is said to do work if when acting there is a  of the point of application in the direction of the force for example when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped the work done on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball  a force  multiplied by the distance to the ground  a displacement  work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another the term work was introduced in 1826 by the french mathematician  as  weight lifted through a height  which is based on the use of early  to lift buckets of water out of flooded ore mines the  of work is the   j

units 
the si unit of work is the   j  which is defined as the work expended by a force of one  through a displacement of one  the dimensionally equivalent   nm  is sometimes used as the measuring unit for work but this can be confused with the unit newton-metre which is the measurement unit of  usage of nm is discouraged by the  since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement or a measurement of work non-si units of work include the  the  the  the  the  and the  due to work having the same  as  occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content such as   and  are utilized as a measuring unit work and energy 
the work  done by a constant force of magnitude  on a point that moves a displacement  in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product

 
for example if a force of 10 newtons     10 n  acts along a point that travels 2 meters     2 m  then it does the work     10 n 2 m    20 n m   20 j this is approximately the work done lifting a 1kg weight from ground level to over a person s head against the force of gravity notice that the work is doubled either by lifting twice the weight the same distance or by lifting the same weight twice the distance work is closely related to  the  states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body conversely a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force from  it can be shown that work on a free  no fields  rigid  no internal degrees of freedom  body is equal to the change in kinetic energy  of the velocity and rotation of that body 


the work of forces generated by a potential function is known as  and the forces are said to be  therefore work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force  without change in velocity or rotation is equal to minus the change of potential energy  of the object 


these formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force so work subsequently possesses the  and units of energy the work energy principles discussed here are identical to electric work energy principles constraint forces 
constraint forces determine the movement of components in a system constraining the object within a boundary  in the case of a slope plus gravity the object is stuck to the slope when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any  tauter  constraint forces ensure the velocity in the direction of the constraint is zero which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the system if the system  they eliminate all movement in the direction of the constraint thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system as the velocity of that object is constrained to be 0 parallel to this force due to this force this only applies for a single particle system for example in an  the rope does work on each body but keeping always the net virtual work null there are however cases where this is not true for example the  exerted inwards by a string on a ball in uniform  sideways constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle this force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball another example is a book on a table if external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards the force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform work the  on a charged particle is f   qv  b where q is the charge v is the velocity of the particle and b is the  the result of a  is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors so f  v the  of two perpendicular vectors is always zero so the work w   f  v   0 and the magnetic force does not do work it can change the direction of motion but never change the speed mathematical calculation 
for moving objects the quantity of work time  power  is calculated thus at any instant the rate of the work done by a force  measured in joules second or watts  is the  of the force  a vector  and the velocity vector of the point of application this scalar product of force and velocity is classified as instantaneous  just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance by the  the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application work is the result of a force on a point that moves through a displacement as the point moves it follows a curve x with a velocity v at each instant the small amount of work w that occurs over an instant of time dt is calculated as



where the f  v is the power over the instant dt the sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work 


where c is the trajectory from x t1  to x t2  this integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle and is therefore said to be path dependent if the force is always directed along this line and the magnitude of the force is f then this integral simplifies to



where s is displacement along the line if f is constant in addition to being directed along the line then the integral simplifies further to



where s is the displacement of the point along the line this calculation can be generalized for a constant force that is not directed along the line followed by the particle in this case the  f  ds   f cos  ds where  is the angle between the force vector and the direction of movement that is



in the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90 from the velocity vector  as when a body moves in a circle under a central force  no work is done at all since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero thus no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit  this is ideal as all orbits are slightly elliptical  also no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge work done by a variable force 
calculating the work as  force times straight path segment  would only apply in the most simple of circumstances as noted above if force is changing or if the body is moving along a curved path possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid then only the path of the application point of the force is relevant for the work done and only the component of the force parallel to the application point  is doing work  positive work when in the same direction and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity  this component of force can be described by the scalar quantity called scalar tangential component   where  is the angle between the force and the velocity  and then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows 

work of a force is the line integral of its scalar tangential component along the path of its application point if the force varies  e.g compressing a spring  we need to use calculus to find the work done if the force is given by f x   a function of x  then the work done by the force along the x-axis from a to b is 


torque and rotation 
a  results from equal and opposite forces acting on two different points of a rigid body the sum  resultant  of these forces may cancel but their effect on the body is the couple or torque t the work of the torque is calculated as



where the t   is the power over the instant t the sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work 


this integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity  that varies with time and is therefore said to be path dependent if the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction then it takes the form 


where  is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector s in this case the work of the torque becomes 


where c is the trajectory from  t1  to  t2  this integral depends on the rotational trajectory  t  and is therefore path-dependent if the torque t is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that 


and both the torque and angular velocity are constant then the work takes the form 






a force of constant magnitude and perpendicular to the lever arm


this result can be understood more simply by considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude f being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance r as shown in the figure this force will act through the distance along the circular arc s   r so the work done is



introduce the torque    fr to obtain



as presented above notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work work and potential energy 
the scalar product of a force f and the velocity v of its point of application defines the  input to a system at an instant of time integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application c   x t  defines the work input to the system by the force path dependence 
therefore the  done by a force f on an object that travels along a curve c is given by the  



where dx t  defines the trajectory c and v is the velocity along this trajectory in general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent the time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power 


path independence 
if the work for an applied force is independent of the path then the work done by the force is by the  the potential function evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application such a force is said to be  this means that there is a potential function u x  that can be evaluated at the two points x t1  and x t2  to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points it is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential that is



the function u x  is called the  associated with the applied force examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces in this case the  of work yields



and the force f is said to be  derivable from a potential 
because the potential u defines a force f at every point x in space the set of forces is called a  the power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work or potential in the direction of the velocity v of the body that is



work by gravity 




gravity f   mg does work w   mgh along any descending path


in the absence of other forces gravity results in a constant downward acceleration of every freely moving object near earth s surface the acceleration due to gravity is g   9.8ms2 and the gravitational force on an object of mass m is fg   mg it is convenient to imagine this gravitational force concentrated at the center of mass of the object if an object is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance y2  y1 the work w done on the object by its weight mg is 



where fg is weight  pounds in imperial units and newtons in si units  and y is the change in height y notice that the work done by gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the object the presence of friction does not affect the work done on the object by its weight work by gravity in space 
the force of gravity exerted by a mass m on another mass m is given by



where r is the position vector from m to m let the mass m move at the velocity v then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position r t1  to r t2  is given by



notice that the position and velocity of the mass m are given by



where er and et are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from m to m use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to 


this calculation uses the fact that



the function



is the gravitational potential function also known as  the negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy work by a spring 




forces in springs assembled in parallel


consider a spring that exerts a horizontal force f    kx 0 0  that is proportional to its deflection in the x direction independent of how a body moves the work of this spring on a body moving along the space with the curve x t     x t  y t  z t  is calculated using its velocity v    vx vy vz  to obtain



for convenience consider contact with the spring occurs at t   0 then the integral of the product of the distance x and the x-velocity xvx is  1 2 x2 work by a gas 



where p is pressure v is volume and a and b are initial and final volumes workenergy principle 
the principle of work and   also known as the workenergy principle  states that the work done by all forces acting on a particle  the work of the resultant force  equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle that is the work w done by the  on a  equals the change in the particle s kinetic energy  
 
where  and  are the  of the particle before and after the work is done and m is its  the derivation of the workenergy principle begins with  and the resultant force on a particle computation of the scalar product of the forces with the velocity of the particle evaluates the instantaneous power added to the system constraints define the direction of movement of the particle by ensuring there is no component of velocity in the direction of the constraint force this also means the constraint forces do not add to the instantaneous power the time integral of this scalar equation yields work from the instantaneous power and kinetic energy from the scalar product of velocity and acceleration the fact the workenergy principle eliminates the constraint forces underlies  this section focuses on the workenergy principle as it applies to particle dynamics in more general systems work can change the  of a mechanical device the thermal energy in a thermal system or the  in an electrical device work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another derivation for a particle moving along a straight line 
in the case the  f is constant in both magnitude and direction and parallel to the velocity of the particle the particle is moving with constant acceleration a along a straight line the relation between the net force and the acceleration is given by the equation f   ma   and the particle  s can be expressed by the equation



which follows from   see   the work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement substituting the above equations one obtains 



other derivation 









vertical displacement derivation
w   f  s   mg  h
in the general case of rectilinear motion when the net force f is not constant in magnitude but is constant in direction and parallel to the velocity of the particle the work must be integrated along the path of the particle 



general derivation of the workenergy theorem for a particle 
for any net force acting on a particle moving along any curvilinear path it can be demonstrated that its work equals the change in the kinetic energy of the particle by a simple derivation analogous to the equation above some authors call this result workenergy principle but it is more widely known as the workenergy theorem 



the identity  requires some algebra from the identity  and definition  it follows

 
the remaining part of the above derivation is just simple calculus same as in the preceding rectilinear case derivation for a particle in constrained movement 
in particle dynamics a formula equating work applied to a system to its change in kinetic energy is obtained as a first integral of  it is useful to notice that the resultant force used in newton s laws can be separated into forces that are applied to the particle and forces imposed by constraints on the movement of the particle remarkably the work of a constraint force is zero therefore only the work of the applied forces need be considered in the workenergy principle to see this consider a particle p that follows the trajectory x t  with a force f acting on it isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces r then newton s law takes the form



where m is the mass of the particle vector formulation 
note that n dots above a vector indicates its nth  the  of each side of newton s law with the velocity vector yields



because the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point x t1  to the point x t2  to obtain



the left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time t1 to time t2 this can also be written as



this integral is computed along the trajectory x t  of the particle and is therefore path dependent the right side of the first integral of newton s equations can be simplified using the following identity



 see  for derivation  now it is integrated explicitly to obtain the change in kinetic energy 


where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity 


tangential and normal components 
it is useful to resolve the velocity and acceleration vectors into tangential and normal components along the trajectory x t  such that



where



then the  of velocity with acceleration in newton s second law takes the form

 
where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity 


the result is the workenergy principle for particle dynamics 


this derivation can be generalized to arbitrary rigid body systems moving in a straight line  skid to a stop 
consider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to f the constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define r and we have



for convenience let the trajectory be along the x-axis so x    d 0  and the velocity is v    v 0  then r  v   0 and f  v   fxv where fx is the component of f along the x-axis so



integration of both sides yields



if fx is constant along the trajectory then the integral of velocity is distance so



as an example consider a car skidding to a stop where k is the coefficient of friction and w is the weight of the car then the force along the trajectory is fx   kw the velocity v of the car can be determined from the length s of the skid using the workenergy principle 


notice that this formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is m   w g

coasting down a mountain road  gravity racing 
consider the case of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down a mountain road the work-energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity v of say 60mph  88 fps  rolling resistance and air drag will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be greater than if these forces are neglected let the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be x t  which is a curve in three-dimensional space the force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity f    0 0 w  while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force r newton s second law yields 


the  of this equation with the velocity v    vx vy vz  yields



where v is the magnitude of v the constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because r  v   0 which means they do no work integrate both sides to obtain



the weight force w is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance therefore 


recall that v t1 0 notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle in order to determine the distance along the road assume the downgrade is 6 which is a steep road this means the altitude decreases 6 feet for every 100 feet traveledfor angles this small the sin and tan functions are approximately equal therefore the distance s in feet down a 6 grade to reach the velocity v is at least



this formula uses the fact that the weight of the vehicle is w   mg work of forces acting on a rigid body 
the work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a  to see this let the forces f1 f2  fn act on the points x1 x2  xn in a rigid body the trajectories of xi i   1  n are defined by the movement of the rigid body this movement is given by the set of rotations  a t  and the trajectory d t  of a reference point in the body let the coordinates xi i   1  n define these points in the moving rigid body s  m so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame f are given by



the velocity of the points xi along their trajectories are



where  is the angular velocity vector obtained from the skew symmetric matrix



known as the angular velocity matrix the small amount of work by the forces over the small displacements ri can be determined by approximating the displacement by r   vt so



or



this formula can be rewritten to obtain



where f and t are the  applied at the reference point d of the moving frame m in the rigid body references
