meteorological history

the origin of iniki is unclear but it possibly began as a  that exited the african coast on august 18 it moved westward across the unfavorable atlantic ocean and crossed  into the pacific on the august 28 the wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized conditions slowly became more favorable and as the convection concentrated around a center the wave was classified tropical depression eighteen-e on september 5 at this time the wave was located 1700miles  2700km  southwest of  or 1550miles  2500km  east-southeast of  initially the thunderstorm activity was not concentrated towards the center and thus the depression was not expected to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength the depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until september 8 when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm

the   cphc  failed to issue  for the hurricane well in advance for several days prior to the disaster the cphc and the news media forecast iniki to remain well south of the island chain with the only effect being some high surf conditions some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated hawaiian islands but these were rejected by the cphc forecasters as late as early september 10 the cphc suggested that iniki would remain well to the south of the island group it was not until a special bulletin was issued by the cphc less than 24hours before landfallthat any warning was given to the public a hurricane watch was issued for kauai early on september 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day prior to iniki s arrival in kauai 8,000people were housed in shelters many of whom remembered  10years prior because schools were canceled traffic was light during the evacuation and streets were clear by mid-morning rather than sending tourists to public shelters two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm s passage the cphc issued a tropical storm warning for  on september 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day though not hit by the hurricane iniki s large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in oahu public school buildings acted as shelters and were for refuge only meaning they did not provide food cots blankets medications or other comfort items roughly one-third of oahu s population participated in the evacuation though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter the execution of the evacuations went well beginning with the vulnerable coastal area for those in need vans and buses gave emergency transportation while police manned certain overused intersections the two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines impact 

hurricane iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of hawaii causing  1.8billion in damage most damage was on the island of kauai where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power although oahu also suffered significant damage iniki also was responsible for six deaths the hurricane nearly struck the central pacific hurricane center in  had it hit there iniki along with  and  would have struck each of the three  offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period kauai 
hurricane iniki made landfall on the south-central portion of kauai island bringing its dangerous inner core to the entire island upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.56feet  1.41.8m  with some portions of the coastlines having high-water marks of up to 18feet  5.5m  in addition strong waves of up to 35feet  10.5m  in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours causing a debris line of more than 800feet  250m  inland because it moved quickly through the island there were no reports of significant rainfall

hurricane iniki s making landfall during daylight hours combined with the popularity of camcorders led many kauai residents to record much of the damage as it was occurring the footage was later used to create an hour-long video documentary commercial air service was suspended 



wind damage to trees from iniki


hurricane iniki s high winds caused extensive damage in kauai 1,421houses were destroyed and 63 were lost from the storm surge and wave action a total of 5,152homes were severely damaged while 7,178 received minor damage on the south coast hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well a few were restored quickly though some took several years to be rebuilt one hotelthe  famous for elvis presley s never reopened after the hurricane destroyed housing across the island left more than 7,000people homeless after the storm s passage

iniki s high winds also downed 26.5 of the island s transmission poles 37 of its distribution poles and 35 of its 800mile  1300km  distribution wire system the entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period of time electric companies restored only 20 of the island s power service within four weeks of iniki while other areas were without power for up to three months also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector though much of the sugar cane was already harvested what was left was severely damaged the winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees most of iniki s damage occurred in kauai on the island one person died when struck by debris while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her offshore two  nationals died when their boat capsized the reduced death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation more than 100injuries can be attributed to iniki though most occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane among those on kauai was filmmaker  who was preparing for the final day of on-location shooting of the film  he and the 130 of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during iniki s passage according to spielberg  every single structure was in shambles  roofs and walls were torn away  telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see  spielberg included footage of iniki battering the kaua i coastal walls as part of the completed film where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot members of the film s crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads oahu 
upon passing by oahu iniki produced tides of 1.73feet  0.50.9m  above normal prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of oahu with the areas most affected being  through  the waianae coastline experienced the most damage with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments in all hurricane iniki caused several million dollars in property damage and two deaths on oahu big island 
damage on the  was minor seas of 10ft  3.0m  were reported along with 40mph  65km h  winds in  three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk a beach near  on  lost some sand and to this day has never been the same aftermath 





 from iniki


immediately after the storm many were relieved to have survived the worst of the category4 hurricane  their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days because iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed many kauai citizens insisted on paying in addition entertainers from all of hawaii including   who owns a home on the north shore of kauai  and the  provided free concerts to the victims the film jurassic park was being filmed at the time the sets used for the deleted scene where mr arnold goes to the shed to turn the power on were destroyed the cast and crew took shelter in a hotel looting occurred in the aftermath of iniki though it was very minor a group of  who experienced the looting of hurricane andrew just weeks before were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane students returned to kauai public schools two weeks after the disaster kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help the military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs though and help arrived before local officials requested aid  proved to be extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm with volunteers coming from the neighboring islands as well as from around the pacific to assist in the recovery there was support of local government communications in lihue in the first week of recovery  as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the  and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across kauai in the months after the storm many  companies left hawaii to combat this   enacted the hurricane relief fund in 1993 to help unprotected hawaii residents the fund was never needed for another hawaii hurricane and it was stopped in 2000 when insurance companies returned to the island it is thought that hurricane iniki blew apart many  some possibly used to house fighting chickens  this caused a dramatic increase in the numbers of wild  roaming kauai the name iniki was retired due to this storm and was replaced with iolana within the  less than three days after iniki struck  struck the big island as a depression see also
