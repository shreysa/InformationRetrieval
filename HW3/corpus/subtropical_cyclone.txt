history of term 
throughout the 1950s and 1960s the term semi-tropical and quasi-tropical were used for what would become known as subtropical cyclones the term subtropical cyclone merely referred to any cyclone located in the subtropical belt near and just north of the  intense debate ensued in the late 1960s after a number of hybrid cyclones formed in the atlantic basin in 1972 the national hurricane center  nhc  finally designated these storms as subtropical cyclones in real-time and updated the hurricane database to include subtropical cyclones from 1968 through 1971 the term  neutercane  began to be used for small subtropical cyclones which formed from mesoscale features and the nhc began issuing public statements during the  employing that classification this name was not noted as controversial in contemporary news reports but it was dropped less than a year later recent articles published after the year 2000 have suggested that the name  neutercane  was considered sexist in the 1970s but there do not appear to be any published reports from that period making this claim naming 




 in 2002 the first system to be given a name as a subtropical cyclone


in the north atlantic basin subtropical cyclones were initially named from the  list in the early to mid-1970s in the intervening years of 19752001 subtropical storms were either named from the traditional list and considered tropical in real-time or used a separate numbering system between 1992 and 2001 two different numbers were given to subtropical depressions or subtropical storms one for public use the other one for nrl and nhc reference for example  in 2001 was initially known as subtropical storm one as well as al1301  or 13l for short  in 2002 the nhc began giving numbers to subtropical depressions and names to subtropical storms from the same sequence as tropical cyclones from 2002 onwards subtropical depression 13l would be known as subtropical depression thirteen instead  of 2002 was the first subtropical storm to receive a name but became tropical shortly after naming  from the  was the first subtropical storm that did not become tropical since the policy change a subtropical storm from the  also did not become tropical but was not named since it was not recognized until post-season analysis in the southern indian ocean subtropical cyclones are also named once winds reach tropical storm or  force since 2011 subtropical storms in the western south atlantic ocean are named by the  formation

subtropical cyclones form in a wide band of  mainly south of the 50th parallel in the  due to the increased frequency of cyclones which cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the summer and fall subtropical cyclones are significantly more frequent across the north atlantic than the northwestern pacific ocean in the eastern half of the north pacific ocean and north indian ocean the older subtropical cyclone definition term is still used which requires a weak circulation forming underneath a  which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season   in the case of the north indian ocean the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of  rains during the  in the  subtropical cyclones are regularly observed across southern portions of the  most subtropical cyclones form when a deep  extratropical cyclone drops down into the subtropics the system becomes blocked by a high latitude ridge and eventually sheds its frontal boundaries as its source of cool and dry air from the high latitudes diverts away from the system temperature differences between the 500hpa pressure level or 5,900 meters  19,400ft  above ground level and the sea surface temperatures initially exceed the dry adiabatic  which causes an initial round of  to form at a distance east of the center due to the initial cold temperatures aloft sea surface temperatures usually need to reach at least 20c  68f  for this initial round of thunderstorms the initial thunderstorm activity moistens up the environment around the low which destabilizes the atmosphere by reducing the  needed for convection when the next shortwave or upper level jet streak  wind maximum within the jet stream  moves nearby convection reignites closer to the center and the system develops into a true subtropical cyclone the average sea surface temperature that helps lead to subtropical cyclogenesis is 24c  75f  if the thunderstorm activity becomes deep and persistent allowing its initial low level warm core to deepen  is possible the locus of formation for north atlantic subtropical cyclones is out in the open ocean  the island of bermuda is regularly impacted by these systems the south atlantic environment for formation of subtropical cyclones has both stronger vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures yet subtropical cyclogenesis is regularly observed in the open ocean in the south atlantic a second mechanism for formation has been diagnosed for south atlantic subtropical cyclones  lee cyclogenesis in the region of the brazil current transition from extratropical 
by gaining tropical characteristics an extratropical low may transit into a subtropical depression or storm a subtropical depression storm may further gain tropical characteristics to become a pure tropical depression or storm which may eventually develop into a hurricane and there are at least three cases of tropical storms transforming into a subtropical storm   in 1984  in 2001 and  in 2011  generally a tropical storm or tropical depression is not called subtropical while it is becoming extratropical after hitting either land or colder waters this transition normally requires significant instability through the atmosphere with temperature differences between the underlying ocean and the mid-levels of the  requiring over 20c or 72f of contrast in this roughly 5,900 meters  19,400ft  layer of the lower atmosphere the  of the sea surface temperatures that subtropical cyclones form over is 23c  73f  transition from subtropical cyclones into tropical cyclones occurs only in very rare cases over the south atlantic ocean such as  in 2004 characteristics

upper-level low 
the most common type of subtropical storm is an upper-level cold low with circulation extending to the surface layer and maximum sustained winds generally occurring at a radius of about 160 kilometers  99mi  or more from the center in comparison to tropical cyclones such systems have a relatively broad zone of maximum winds that is located farther from the center and typically have a less symmetric wind field and distribution of convection mesoscale low 
a second type of subtropical cyclone is a mesoscale low originating in or near a frontolyzing zone of horizontal wind shear also known as a dying frontal zone with radius of maximum sustained winds generally less than 50 kilometers  31mi  the entire circulation may initially have a diameter of less than 160 kilometers  99mi  these generally short-lived systems may be either  or warm core and in 1972 this type of subtropical cyclone was referred to as a  neutercane  kona storm

a  in december 2010 originally a kona storm


kona storms  or kona lows  are deep cyclones that form during the cool season of the central pacific ocean a definition change in the term during the early 1970s makes categorization of the systems more complex as many kona lows are extratropical cyclones complete with their own weather fronts those across the northeast pacific ocean consider them subtropical cyclones as long as a weak surface circulation is present kona is a hawaiian term for leeward which explains the change in wind direction for the hawaiian islands from easterly to southerly when this type of cyclone is present australian east coast lows

an australian east coast low in june 2013


australian east coast lows  known locally as east coast lows and sometimes as east coast cyclones  are  the most intense of these systems have many of the characteristics of subtropical cyclones they develop between 25south and 40south and within 5 of the australian coastline typically during the winter months each year there are about ten  significant impact  maritime lows  is seen on average just once per year but these storms cause significant wind and flood damage when they occur australian east coast cyclones vary in size from   approximately 10km to 100km  to   approximately 100km to 1,000km  these storms which mostly affect the south east coast should not be confused with  which typically affect the northern half of the continent see also
