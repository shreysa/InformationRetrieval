diamond dust is a ground-level  composed of tiny  crystals this  is also referred to simply as  and is reported in the  code as ic diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies so it is sometimes referred to as clear-sky  it is most commonly observed in  and the  but it can occur anywhere with a temperature well below freezing in  diamond dust may continue for several days without interruption

falling diamond dust  inari finland 


diamond dust is similar to  in that it is a cloud based at the surface  however it differs from fog in two main ways generally fog refers to a cloud composed of liquid water  the term  usually refers to a fog that formed as liquid water and then froze and frequently seems to occur in valleys with airborne pollution such as   while diamond dust forms directly as ice  also fog is a dense enough cloud to significantly reduce visibility while diamond dust is usually very thin and may not have any effect on visibility  there are far fewer crystals in a volume of air than there are droplets in the same volume with fog  however diamond dust can often reduce the visibility in some cases to under 600m  2,000ft  the depth of the diamond dust layer can vary substantially from as little as 20 to 30m  66 to 98ft  to 300 metres  980ft  because diamond dust does not always reduce visibility it is often first noticed by the brief flashes caused when the tiny crystals tumbling through the air reflect sunlight to your eye this glittering effect gives the phenomenon its name since it looks like many tiny diamonds are flashing in the air

these ice crystals usually form when a  is present at the surface and the warmer air above the ground mixes with the colder air near the surface since warmer air frequently contains more  than colder air this mixing will usually also transport water vapor into the air near the surface causing the  of the near-surface air to increase if the relative humidity increase near the surface is large enough then ice crystals may form to form diamond dust the temperature must be below the  of water 0c  32f  or the ice cannot form or would melt however diamond dust is not often observed at temperatures near 0c  32f  at temperatures between 0c  32f  and about 39c  38f  increasing the relative humidity can cause either fog or diamond dust this is because very small droplets of water can remain liquid well below the freezing point a state known as  water in areas with a lot of small particles in the air from human pollution or natural sources like dust the water droplets are likely to be able to freeze at a temperature around 10c  14f  but in very clean areas where there are no particles   to help the droplets freeze they can remain liquid to 39c  38f  at which point even very tiny pure water droplets will freeze in the interior of antarctica diamond dust is fairly common at temperatures below about 25c  13f  artificial diamond dust can form from snow machines which blow ice crystals into the air these are found at ski resorts optical properties 
diamond dust is often associated with  such as   etc like the ice crystals in  or  diamond dust crystals form directly as simple hexagonal ice crystals  as opposed to freezing drops  and generally form slowly this combination results in crystals with well defined shapes  usually either hexagonal plates or columns  which like a prism can  and or  light in specific directions climatology 
while diamond dust can be seen in any area of the world that has cold winters it is most frequent in the interior of antarctica where it is common year-round schwerdtfeger  1970  shows that diamond dust was observed on average 316 days a year at  in antarctica and radok and lile  1977  estimate that over 70 of the precipitation that fell at plateau station in 1967 fell in the form of diamond dust once melted the total precipitation for the year was only 25mm  0.98in  weather reporting and interference 
diamond dust may sometimes cause a problem for  the  and visibility sensor do not always correctly interpret the falling diamond dust and report the visibility and ceiling as zero  overcast skies  however a human observer would correctly notice clear skies and unrestricted visibility the metar identifier for diamond dust within international hourly weather reports is ic see also
