generating prime implicants via ternary encoding and decimal arithmetic decimal arithmetic ternary encoding of cubes and topological considerations are used in an algorithm to obtain the extremals and prime implicants of boolean functions the algorithm which has been programmed in the fortran language generally requires less memory than other minimization procedures and treats dont care terms in an efficient manner cacm July, 1968 Dietmeyer, D.
