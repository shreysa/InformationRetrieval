as an author stewart s output was at once diverse original and important ordeal by hunger pickett s charge and other works are examinations of american history but are unusual in their probing of the interaction of human beings with their physical and social environments his greatest achievement as a novelist earth abides takes somewhat the same perspective but in the context of a collapse of civilization in which everything formerly taken for granted about civilization and the situation of human beings in their environment can no longer be assumed this radically altered circumstance permits stewart to raise and examine issues rarely if ever tackled by other novelists east of giants is historical fiction man an autobiography is one of the very few works of speculative anthropology in which he attempts to deduce how key developments in prehistorical civilization must have unfolded and also offers a wealth of original and interesting insights into the character of early civilization good lives provides a series of biographical sketches with the end in view of determining what it is that makes for a good life an undertaking having much in common with say aristotle s nichomachean ethics not so rich as you think  1968  was a prescient early essay in environmentalism  rachel carson s silent spring had been published only a few years earlier in 1962 and had a much narrower focus  storm  1941  takes an immense storm as its protagonist an extraordinary departure in itself and again teases out the consequences for human beings of this large-scale environmental disruption other works such as names on the land and american ways of life offer other unique insights and perspectives not found anywhere else taken together this enlightening body of work provides a breadth and depth of perspective found elsewhere only in authors like toynbee the durants and carroll quigley but in a far more palatable and accessible form achievements of this stature should have earned stewart a lasting reputation as one of america s greatest writers and men of letters  however the significance of his output was largely overlooked during his lifetime and is now almost forgotten he is today known primarily for his only science fiction novel   1949  a  novel for which he won the inaugural  for fiction in 1951 it was dramatized on radio s  and served as an inspiration for  s  as king has stated the encyclopedia of science fiction calls it  one of the finest of all post-holocaust ruined earth novels  his 1941 novel  featuring as its protagonist a pacific storm called  maria  prompted the  to use personal names to designate storms and inspired  and  to write the song   for their 1951 musical  storm was dramatized as a storm called maria on the november 2 1959 episode of abc s  co-produced by ken nelson productions it blended newsreel footage of several different storms to represent the mega-storm in the novel and traced the storm from its origins in japan to the coast of california the cast included non-actors among them the dam superintendent george kritsky the telephone lineman walt bowen and the highway superintendent leo quinn another novel fire  1948  and an historical work ordeal by hunger  1936  also evoked environmental catastrophes bibliography
