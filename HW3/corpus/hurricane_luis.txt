the origins of hurricane luis trace back to an area of disturbed weather associated with a  over the eastern  on august 26 a low-level circulation center formed and moved westward until it developed a weak  on august 27  consequently a tropical depression was designated at 1200 utc that day the depression attained 36 hours later into a tropical storm named  luis  on august 29 though  fluctuated for the next two days as a result of nearby  the storm slowly intensified while pressure rose the shear relented the next day allowing an  to gradually form and the system attained hurricane status thereafter on early august 31 then a category 3 major hurricane 18 hours later

hurricane luis continued to strengthen as it tracked west-northwestward into a category 4 on the  on september 2 and the cyclone turned more towards the west earlier that day as it maintained a rectilinear slow motion on september 3 a  confirmed that the storm that reached category 4 status earlier peaked with 140mph  230km h  and maintained it for two days and a half at this time it was located approximately 540 miles  870km  to the east of the  as a result the storm began to slightly accelerate as it moved along a  due to the absorption of  by the stronger  by the day of september 4 luis sustained a large wind field as it approach the lesser antilles its tropical storm-force winds measured from 345mi  555km  to 365mi  587km  in diameter as it begin to affected in the night    and  on the morning of september 5 islands such as dominica and even the islands of guadeloupe where it experienced hurricane-force winds on the northeastern coast of  and  has been relatively spared by the storm however the eyewall of the hurricane skimed antigua and directly passing over barbuda while weakened slightly during the time it proceeded slowly northwestward affecting    and  causing moderate damage later luis moved along   and ultimately crossed anguilla where maximum sustained winds within the  were estimated to have reached 135mph  217km h  and its central pressure had dropped from 945 to 942  27.9 to 27.8  a large and powerful hurricane luis retained category 4 intensity until september 7 situated about 150mi  240km  to the north of  the storm gradually re-curved over the northern atlantic as a category 2 after having spent 7 consecutive days as a major hurricane with  of at least 115mph  185km h  from september 1 to 8 from there on the center of the storm passed 200 miles  320km  to the west of  on september 9 causing minor damage and then later weakened to a category2 hurricane with winds of 110mph  165km h  several hours later the hurricane made its closest approach to bermuda passing about 200mi  320km  west of the island later that day the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of luis during the afternoon of september10 hurricane luis began to undergo an  as it rapidly approached the canadian coastline due to the rapid movement of the storm significant weakening did not occur until luis was at an unusually high latitude as the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961mbar  28.38inhg  but sustained winds did not exceed 90mph  140km h  according to the nhc luis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the  in eastern newfoundland early on september11 while tracking over newfoundland cold dry air became entrenched in luis s circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough the nhc issued their final advisory on hurricane luis at 0900utc on september11 as it tracked nearly 65mph  100km h  to the northeast and transitioned into an  on september 11 as it moved ashore on eastern  the extratropical remnants persisted for 30more hours over the north atlantic ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of  late on september12 preparations 




hurricane luis on september6 to the north of the leeward islands


3 days before devastation occurred in the northern lesser antilles hurricane luis became a category 4 hurricane and forecasted to avoid those area well to the north following humberto and karen however as karen neared iris it weakened and absorbed by a stronger iris as influenced by the subtropical ridge steering luis to the west leeward islands and puerto rico 
due to its slow motion giving local officials ample time to prepare in advance of the storm  were declared in several areas throughout the  seventeen watches and or warnings were issued in association with luis the first two were a hurricane watch issued on antigua barbuda and guadeloupe on september2 at 2200utc five hours later a tropical storm watch was issued for dominica at 2100utc a hurricane warning was issued for antigua barbuda and a hurricane watch for guadeloupe at 1500utc puerto rico was put under a tropical storm watch at 1700utc guadeloupe st barthelemy and french portion of st martin were put under a hurricane warning four hours later puerto rico u.s and british virgin islands were put under a tropical storm warning this is including  and  bermuda and canada 
additionally a tropical storm warning was also issued for bermuda on september 7 all of which were canceled by september 10 however there were no tropical storm watches or warnings issued for any part of  impact
overall luis caused extensive crop and property damage across the leeward islands due to its high associated powerful winds and heavy rainfall the exact amount of damage caused by the storm is unknown due to lack of reports from affected areas since  though it is estimated at  3billion  1995usd  antigua and barbuda 
as a result of a direct hit from the category4 hurricane both antigua and barbuda experienced extensive damage to residences from 135mph winds and over 10 inches  250mm  of rain according to the islands  prime minister a great number of houses were damaged or destroyed in barbuda and nearly 45 of the residences on antigua were eradicated by the hurricane as it passed 25 miles  40km  to the north of the island across the islands numerous inhabitants experienced power outages and disrupted water systems the storm ultimately accounted for three deaths and injured 165 locals  32.000 inhabitants on both islands were greatly affected forced 1,700 people to take shelter and left approximately 3,200 others homeless throughout the country the total damage from the storm was estimated  350million or 60 of the country s  worth of damage was assessed international aid was sought after the storm had made its passing with shelter and food supplies being the most needed guadeloupe

aside from high winds and seas possible explanation for the storm s heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations and their houses another factual reason was substantial difference in wind speed forecasts measured at sea-level  on the dutch side and those measured on homes throughout the island hillsides   broadcast from sites off the island sea-level airport readings showed 86mph  139km h  sustained winds and winds gusting to 114mph  183km h  whereas measurements on some hillside homes and especially the airport on the north of the french side between two mountains showed wind gusts between 170 and 205mph  275 and 330km h  an sailor that been sheltered in the lagoon recorded a 115mph  185km h  winds gusting and a minimal pressure reading to 965mbar  28.5inhg  records and retirement
