history
main article  




 buildings in  netherlands estec was the main technical centre of esro and remains so for the successor organisation esa 

after  many european scientists left  in order to work with the united states although the 1950s boom made it possible for western european countries to invest in research and specifically in space-related activities western european scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers in 1958 only months after the    italy  and   france  two prominent members of the western european scientific community met to discuss the foundation of a common western european space agency the meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries including   united kingdom  the western european nations decided to have two agencies  one concerned with developing a launch system   european launch development organization  and the other the precursor of the european space agency   european space research organisation  the latter was established on 20 march 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 june 1962 from 1968 to 1972 esro launched seven research satellites esa in its current form was founded with the esa convention in 1975 when esro was merged with eldo esa had ten founding member states  belgium denmark france germany italy the netherlands spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom these signed the esa convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980 when the convention came into force during this interval the agency functioned in a  fashion esa launched its first major scientific mission in 1975  a space probe monitoring  in the universe which was first worked on by esro later activities 




mock-up of the 


the esa collaborated with  on the   iue  the world s first high-orbit telescope which was launched in 1978 and operated successfully for 18 years a number of successful earth-orbit projects followed and in 1986 esa began  its first deep-space mission to study the comets  and   a star-mapping mission was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s   and the  were all jointly carried out with nasa later scientific missions in co-operation with nasa include the  space probe to which esa contributed by building the  landing module  as the successor of  esa has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads  launched in 1979 carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward the next two versions of the ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system the  which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established esa as the world leader  in commercial space launches in the 1990s although the succeeding  experienced a failure on its first flight it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 56 successful launches as of september 2011 the successor launch vehicle of  the  is under development and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s the beginning of the new millennium saw esa become along with agencies like nasa    and  one of the major participants in scientific  although esa had relied on co-operation with nasa in previous decades especially the 1990s changed circumstances  such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the   led to decisions to rely more on itself and on co-operation with russia a 2011 press issue thus stated 

russia is esa s first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to space there is a framework agreement between esa and the government of the russian federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and cooperation is already under way in two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both partners 
notable outcomes are esa s include  a probe testing cutting-edge new space propulsion technology the  and  missions as well as the development of the ariane 5 rocket and its role in the  partnership esa maintains its scientific and research projects mainly for astronomy-space missions such as  launched on 27 december 2006 a milestone in the search for  mission 
the treaty establishing the european space agency reads 

esa s purpose shall be to provide for and to promote for exclusively peaceful purposes cooperation among european states in space research and technology and their space applications with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems

esa is responsible for setting a unified space and related industrial policy recommending space objectives to the member states and integrating national programs like satellite development into the european program as much as possible   esa s director general  2003-2015   outlined the european space agency s mission in a 2003 interview 

today space activities are pursued for the benefit of citizens and citizens are asking for a better quality of life on earth they want greater security and economic wealth but they also want to pursue their dreams to increase their knowledge and they want younger people to be attracted to the pursuit of science and technology i think that space can do all of this  it can produce a higher quality of life better security more economic wealth and also fulfill our citizens  dreams and thirst for knowledge and attract the young generation this is the reason space exploration is an integral part of overall space activities it has always been so and it will be even more important in the future

by 2015 esa was an intergovernmental organisation of 22 member states member states participate to varying degrees in the mandatory  25 of total expenditures in 2008  and optional space programmes  75 of total expenditures in 2008  the 2008 budget amounted to 3.0 billion the 2009 budget to 3.6 billion the total budget amounted to about 3.7 billion in 2010 3.99 billion in 2011 4.02 billion in 2012 4.28 billion in 2013 4.10 billion in 2014 and 4.33 billion in 2015 languages generally used are english and french additionally official documents are also provided in german and documents regarding the  are also provided in italian if found appropriate the agency may conduct its correspondence in any language of a member state the following table lists all the member states and adjunct members their esa convention ratification dates and their contributions in 2016 




^    these nations are considered initial signatories but since they were members of neither  nor   the precursor organisations to esa  the convention could only enter into force when the last of the other 10 founders ratified it ^           founding members and initial signatories drafted the esa charter which entered into force on 30 october 1980 these nations were also members of either  or  ^          acceded members became esa member states upon signing an accession agreement  canada is an associated member of esa  framework agreement establishing the legal basis for cooperation between esa and the  came into force in may 2004 


associate members 
currently the only associated member of esa is canada previously associated members were austria norway and finland all of which later joined esa as full members canada 
since 1 january 1979 canada has had the special status of a cooperating state within esa by virtue of this accord the  takes part in esa s deliberative bodies and decision-making and also in esa s programmes and activities canadian firms can bid for and receive contracts to work on programmes the accord has a provision ensuring a fair industrial return to canada the most recent cooperation agreement was signed on 2010-12-15 with a term extending to 2020 for 2014 canada s annual assessed contribution to the esa general budget was 6,059,449.00  8,559,050  for 2017 canada has increased its annual contribution to 21,600,000  30,000,000  budget appropriation and allocation 




european space agency 2016 budget by domain out of a total budget is 5250m 

esa is funded from annual contributions by  governments as well as from an annual contribution by the   eu  the budget of esa was 5.250 billion in 2016 every 34 years esa member states agree on a budget plan for several years at an esa member states conference this plan can be amended in future years however provides the major guideline for esa for several years  the 2016 budget allocations for major areas of esa activity are shown in the chart on the right countries typically have their own space programmes that differ in how they operate organisationally and financially with esa for example the french space agency cnes has a total budget of 2015 million of which 755 million is paid as direct financial contribution to esa several space-related projects are joint projects between national space agencies and esa  e.g   also esa is not the only european governmental space organisation  for example   enlargement

after the decision of the esa council of 21 22 march 2001 the procedure for accession of the  was detailed as described the document titled  the plan for european co-operating states  pecs  nations that want to become a full member of esa do so in 3 stages first a cooperation agreement is signed between the country and esa in this stage the country has very limited financial responsibilities if a country wants to co-operate more fully with esa it signs a european cooperating state  ecs  agreement the ecs agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in esa procurements the country can also participate in all esa programmes except for the basic technology research programme while the financial contribution of the country concerned increases it is still much lower than that of a full member state the agreement is normally followed by a plan for european cooperating state  or pecs charter  this is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation s space industry capacity at the end of the 5-year period the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new pecs charter many countries most of which joined the eu in both 2004 and 2007 have started to co-operate with esa on various levels 

during the ministerial meeting in december 2014 esa ministers approved a resolution calling for discussions to begin with israel australia and south africa on future association agreements the ministers noted that concrete cooperation is at an advanced stage with these nations and that prospects for mutual benefits are existing a separate space exploration strategy resolution calls for further co-operation with the united states russia and china on  leo exploration including a continuation of iss cooperation and the development of a robust plan for the coordinated use of space transportation vehicles and systems for exploration purposes participation in robotic missions for the exploration of the moon the robotic exploration of mars leading to a broad mars sample return mission in which europe should be involved as a full partner and human missions beyond leo in the longer term 
eu and the european space agency 

the political perspective of the   eu  was to make esa an  by 2014 although this date was not met the eu is already the largest single donor to esa s budget and non-esa eu states are observers at esa the only current  that has not signed an esa cooperation agreement is croatia in december 2014 the esa ministerial council authorised officials to begin discussions to establish formal co-operation with croatia launch vehicle fleet 
esa has a fleet of different launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the launch market esa s fleet consists of three major rocket designs    and  rocket launches are carried out by  which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the ariane 5 as well as  at esa s  because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits launches from french guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher  in addition equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra  push  of nearly 500m s due to the higher  of the earth at the equator compared to near the earth s poles where rotational velocity approaches zero ariane 5

vega is esa s carrier for small satellites developed by seven esa members led by  it is capable of carrying a payload with a mass of between 300 and 1500kg to an altitude of 700km for low  its maiden launch from  was on 13 february 2012 the rocket has three solid propulsion stages and a    the   for accurate orbital insertion and the ability to place multiple  into different orbits ariane launch vehicle development funding 
historically the ariane family rockets have been funded primarily  with money contributed by esa governments seeking to participate in the program rather than through competitive industry bids this  governments commit multiyear funding to the development with the expectation of a roughly 90 return on investment in the form of industrial workshare  esa is proposing changes to this scheme by moving to  bids for the development of the  human space flight




 became the first esa astronaut to fly into space 

at the time esa was formed its main goals did not encompass human space flight  rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for unmanned space exploration in contrast to its american and soviet counterparts it is therefore not surprising that the first non-soviet european in space was not an esa astronaut on a european space craft  it was   who in 1978 became the first non-soviet or american in space  the first man in space being  of the soviet union   on a   followed by the   and   in the same year this soviet co-operation programme known as  primarily involved the participation of  countries in 1982 however  became the first  astronaut on a flight to the soviet  space station because chrtien did not officially fly into space as an esa astronaut but rather as a member of the french  astronaut corps the german  is considered the first esa astronaut to fly into space he participated in the   mission that included the first use of the european-built  in 1983 sts-9 marked the beginning of an extensive esa nasa joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of esa astronauts in the following years some of these missions with spacelab were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by esa  such as two missions by germany and one by japan  with european astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board beside paying for spacelab flights and seats on the shuttles esa continued its human space flight co-operation with the  and later russia including numerous visits to  during the latter half of the 1980s european human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore in 1990 the  in  germany was established it selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners especially with regard to the  as of 2006 the esa astronaut corps officially included twelve members including nationals from most large european countries except the united kingdom in the summer of 2008 esa started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009 almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in june 2008 8,413 fulfilled the initial application criteria of the applicants 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing which narrowed down the field to 192 after two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009 as well as formal interviews six new members of the  were selected  five men and one woman astronaut names

crew vehicles 
in the 1980s france pressed for an independent european crew launch vehicle around 1978 it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in november 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of  was introduced the craft was comparable to early proposals for the  and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments with a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the  rocket which was being developed at that time it was planned solely for use in  space flights the planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991  the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly with the fall of the  esa looked forward to co-operation with russia to build a next-generation space vehicle thus the hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent the  had a similar fate in the 21st century esa started new programmes in order to create its own crew vehicles most notable among its various projects and proposals is  whose prototype by  called  has already been tested while projects such as  are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation with the  have emerged following talks with the  in 2004 and june 2005 a co-operation between esa and the  was announced to jointly work on the russian-designed  a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond leo  e.g the moon or even mars  it was speculated that europe would finance part of it a 50 million participation study for kliper which was expected to be approved in december 2005 was finally not approved by the esa member states the russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006 in june 2006 esa member states granted 15 million to the   csts  study a two-year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond low-earth orbit based on the current  design this project was pursued with  instead of the cancelled kliper proposal a decision on the actual implementation and construction of the csts spacecraft was contemplated for 2008 in mid-2009 eads astrium was awarded a 21 million study into designing a crew vehicle based on the european atv which is believed to now be the basis of the advanced crew transportation system design in november 2012 esa decided to join nasa s  the atv would form the basis of a propulsion unit for nasa s new manned spacecraft esa may also seek to work with nasa on orion s launch system as well in order to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts in september 2014 esa signed an agreement with  for co-operation in  project further studies on the dream chaser for european utilization or  project were funded including the feasibility of launching a europeanized dream chaser onboard ariane 5 cooperation with other countries and organisations 
esa has signed co-operation agreements with the following states that currently neither plan to integrate as tightly with esa institutions as canada nor envision future membership of esa  argentina brazil china india  for the  mission  russia and  additionally esa has joint projects with the   of the united states and is participating in the  together with the united states  nasa  russia and japan  jaxa  european union 




esa and eu member states
esa-only members
eu-only members



esa is not an agency or body of the   eu  and has non-eu countries  norway and switzerland  as members there are however ties between the two with various agreements in place and being worked on to define the legal status of esa with regard to the eu there are common goals between esa and the eu esa has an eu liaison office in brussels on certain projects the eu and esa co-operate such as the upcoming  satellite navigation system space policy has since december 2009 been an area for voting in the  under the  the eu esa and its member states committed themselves to increasing co-ordination of their activities and programmes and to organising their respective roles relating to space the lisbon treaty of 2009 reinforces the case for space in europe and strengthens the role of esa as an r d space agency article 189 of the treaty gives the eu a mandate to elaborate a european space policy and take related measures and provides that the eu should establish appropriate relations with esa former italian astronaut  during his tenure as a  from 2004 to 2009 stressed the importance of the european union as a driving force for space exploration  since other players are coming up such as india and china it is becoming ever more important that europeans can have an independent access to space we have to invest more into space research and technology in order to have an industry capable of competing with other international players 
the first eu-esa international conference on human space exploration took place in prague on 22 and 23 october 2009 a road map which would lead to a common vision and strategic planning in the area of space exploration was discussed ministers from all 29 eu and esa members as well as members of parliament were in attendance national space organisations of member states 

the   cnes   national centre for space study  is the french government space agency  administratively a  public establishment of industrial and commercial character  its headquarters are in central  cnes is the main participant on the ariane project indeed cnes designed and tested all ariane family rockets  mainly from its centre in  near  
the  is a partnership of the uk government departments which are active in space through the uk space agency the partners provide delegates to represent the uk on the various esa governing bodies each partner funds its own programme the   agenzia spaziale italiana or asi  was founded in 1988 to promote co-ordinate and conduct space activities in italy operating under the ministry of the universities and of scientific and technological research the agency cooperates with numerous entities active in space technology and with the president of the council of ministers internationally the asi provides italy s delegation to the council of the european space agency and to its subordinate bodies the   dlr   german  deutsches zentrum fr luft und raumfahrt e v  is the national research centre for aviation and space flight of the federal republic of germany and of other member states in the  its extensive research and development projects are included in national and international cooperative programmes in addition to its research projects the centre is the assigned space agency of germany bestowing headquarters of german space flight activities and its associates the   inta   national institute for aerospace technique  is a public research organization specialised in aerospace research and technology development in spain among other functions it serves as a platform for space research and acts as a significant testing facility for the aeronautic and space sector in the country 
nasa 
esa has a long history of collaboration with  since esa s astronaut corps was formed the  has been the primary launch vehicle used by esa s astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with nasa in the 1980s and 1990s the  programme was an esa-nasa joint research programme that had esa develop and manufacture orbital labs for the space shuttle for several flights on which esa participate with astronauts in experiments in robotic science mission and exploration missions nasa has been esa s main partner  was a joint nasa-esa mission along with the    and others also the  is a joint project of nasa and esa future esa-nasa joint projects include the  and the proposed   nasa has committed to provide support to esa s proposed  mission to return an asteroid sample to earth for further analysis  nasa and esa will also likely join together for a  since china has started to invest more money into space activities the  has sought international partnerships esa is beside the  one of its most important partners recently the two space agencies cooperated in the development of the  esa entered into a major joint venture with russia in the form of the  the preparation of  spaceport for launches of  rockets and other projects with india esa agreed to send instruments into space aboard the  s  in 2008 esa is also co-operating with japan the most notable current project in collaboration with  is the  mission to  speaking to reporters at an air show near moscow in august 2011 esa head jean-jacques dordain said esa and russia s roskosmos space agency would  carry out the first flight to mars together

the eu flag is the one to be flown in space during missions  for example it was flown by esa s andre kuipers during delta mission 
the  is increasingly working together towards common objectives some 20 per cent of the funds managed by esa now originate from the supranational  however in recent years the ties between esa and the european institutions have been reinforced by the increasing role that space plays in supporting europes social political and economic policies the legal basis for the eu esa co-operation is provided by a framework agreement which entered into force in may 2004 according to this agreement the european commission and esa co-ordinate their actions through the joint secretariat a small team of ecs administrators and esa executive the member states of the two organisations meet at ministerial level in the space council which is a concomitant meeting of the eu and esa councils prepared by member states representatives in the high-level space policy group  hspg  esa maintains a liaison office in brussels to facilitate relations with the european institutions guaranteeing european access to space 
in may 2007 the 29 european countries expressed their support for the european space policy in a resolution of the space council unifying the approach of esa with those of the european union and their member states prepared jointly by the european commission and esas director general the european space policy sets out a basic vision and strategy for the space sector and addresses issues such as security and defence access to space and exploration through this resolution the eu esa and their member states all commit to increasing co-ordination of their activities and programmes and their respective roles relating to space see also
