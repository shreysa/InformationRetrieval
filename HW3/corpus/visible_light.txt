generally em radiation or emr  the designation  radiation  excludes static electric and magnetic and   is classified by wavelength into radio   the visible region that we perceive as light   and  the behavior of emr depends on its wavelength higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths when emr interacts with single atoms and molecules its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries emr in the visible light region consists of quanta  called   that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule at the lower end of the visible light spectrum emr becomes invisible to humans  infrared  because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change  a change in conformation  in the visual molecule  in the human retina which change triggers the sensation of vision there exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared but not by means of quantum-absorption  depends on a kind of natural  in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation emr in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects which is how these animals detect it above the range of visible light ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 nanometers and the internal lens below 400 furthermore the  and  located in the  of the human eye cannot detect the very short  below 360nm  ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet many animals with eyes that do not require lenses  such as insects and shrimp  are able to detect ultraviolet by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light various sources define visible light as narrowly as 420 to 680 to as broadly as 380 to 800nm under ideal laboratory conditions people can see infrared up to at least 1050nm  children and young adults may perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about 310 to 313nm plant growth is also affected by the color spectrum of light a process known as  


speed of light
main article  
the speed of light in a  is defined to be exactly 299,792,458  approx 186,282 miles per second  the fixed value of the speed of light in si units results from the fact that the metre is now defined in terms of the speed of light all forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum different  have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history  attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century an early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by  a danish physicist in 1676 using a  rmer observed the motions of  and one of its   noting discrepancies in the apparent period of io s orbit he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of  s orbit however its size was not known at that time if rmer had known the diameter of the earth s orbit he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000m s another more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in europe by  in 1849 fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away a rotating  was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source to the mirror and then returned to its origin fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back knowing the distance to the mirror the number of teeth on the wheel and the rate of rotation fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000m s  carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000m s in 1862  conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931 he refined foucault s methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from  to  in california the precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000m s the effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary  is less than in vacuum for example the speed of light in water is about 3 4 of that in vacuum two independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a  complete standstill  by passing it through a  of the element  one team at  and the  in cambridge massachusetts and the other at the  also in cambridge however the popular description of light being  stopped  in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time as stimulated by a second laser pulse during the time it had  stopped  it had ceased to be light optics

refraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another it is described by  



where 1 is the angle between the ray and the  in the first medium 2 is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium and n1 and n2 are the  n   1 in a  and n   1 in a   when a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium or between two different media the wavelength of the light changes but the frequency remains constant if the beam of light is not   or rather normal  to the boundary the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam this change of direction is known as  the refractive quality of  is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images     and  are all examples of this manipulation light sources

there are many sources of light a body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of  radiation a simple thermal source is  the radiation emitted by the  of the  at around 6,000 kelvins  5,730 degrees celsius  10,340 degrees fahrenheit  peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units and roughly 44 of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible another example is  which emit only around 10 of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared a common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in  but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum the peak of the blackbody spectrum is in the deep infrared at about 10  wavelength for relatively cool objects like human beings as the temperature increases the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths producing first a red glow then a white one and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet these colours can be seen when metal is heated to  red hot  or  white hot  blue-white  is not often seen except in stars  the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a  flame or a  torch is in fact due to molecular emission notably by ch radicals  emitting a wavelength band around 425nm and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation  atoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies this produces   in the spectrum of each atom  can be  as in   lamps  such as  and   etc  and flames  light from the hot gas itselfso for example  in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light  emission can also be  as in a  or a microwave  deceleration of a free charged particle such as an  can produce visible radiation    and  radiation are all examples of this particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible  certain chemicals produce visible radiation by  in living things this process is called  for example  produce light by this means and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake certain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation a process known as  some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation this is known as  phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles  is one example this mechanism is used in   and

units and measures
main articles   and 
light is measured with two main alternative sets of units   consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths while  measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardised model of human brightness perception photometry is useful for example to quantify  intended for human use the si units for both systems are summarised in the following tables 
table1.si radiometry units










table2.si photometry quantities









the photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light the  in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555nm therefore two sources of light which produce the same intensity  w m2  of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright the photometry units are designed to take this into account and therefore are a better representation of how  bright  a light appears to be than raw intensity they relate to raw  by a quantity called  and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings the illumination measured by a  sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye and without filters which may be costly photocells and   ccd  tend to respond to some   or both light pressure
main article  
light exerts physical pressure on objects in its path a phenomenon which can be deduced by maxwell s equations but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light  photons strike and transfer their momentum light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by  the speed of light due to the magnitude of c the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects for example a one-milliwatt  exerts a force of about 3.3  on the object being illuminated  thus one could lift a  with laser pointers but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mw laser pointers however inscale applications such as   nems  the effect of light pressure is more significant and exploiting light pressure to drive nems mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research at larger scales light pressure can cause  to spin faster acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a  the possibility of making  that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation although the motion of the  was originally attributed to light pressure this interpretation is incorrect  the characteristic crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum this should not be confused with the  in which the  slight  motion caused by torque  though not enough for full rotation against friction  is directly caused by light pressure as a consequence of light pressure  in 1909 predicted the existence of  radiation friction  which would oppose the movement of matter he wrote radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate the forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest however if it is in motion more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion  front surface  than on the back surface the backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back hence as the resultant of the two forces there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate we will call this resultant  radiation friction  in brief historical theories about light in chronological order
classical greece and hellenism

in the fifth century bc  postulated that everything was composed of   fire air earth and water he believed that  made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible if this were true then one could see during the night just as well as during the day so empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun in about 300 bc  wrote optica in which he studied the properties of light euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically he questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye for he asks how one sees the stars immediately if one closes one s eyes then opens them at night of course if the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem in 55 bc  a roman who carried on the ideas of earlier greek  wrote that  the light   heat of the sun  these are composed of minute atoms which when they are shoved off lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove   from on the nature of the universe  despite being similar to later particle theories lucretius s views were not generally accepted   c 2nd century  wrote about the  of light in his book optics classical india

descartes
  15961650  held that light was a  property of the luminous body rejecting the  forms  of  and  as well as the  species  of   and  in 1637 he published a theory of the  of light that assumed incorrectly that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves  although descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media descartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium descartes  theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics particle theory

  15921655  an atomist proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s  studied gassendi s work at an early age and preferred his view to descartes  theory of the plenum he stated in his hypothesis of light of 1675 that light was composed of   particles of matter  which were emitted in all directions from a source one of newton s arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles while light travelled only in straight lines he did however explain the phenomenon of the  of light  which had been observed by   by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the  newton s theory could be used to predict the  of light but could only explain  by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser  because the  pull was greater newton published the final version of his theory in his  of 1704 his reputation helped the  to hold sway during the 18th century the particle theory of light led  to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it in other words it would become what is now called a  laplace withdrew his suggestion later after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light  as has been explained neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct  a translation of newton s essay on light appears in the large scale structure of space-time by  and  the fact that light could be  was for the first time qualitatively explained by newton using the particle theory  in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization  in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization at that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory wave theory
to explain the origin of colors   1635-1703  developed a  pulse theory  and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work   observation ix  in 1672 hooke suggested that light s vibrations could be  to the direction of propagation   1629-1695  worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678 and published it in his  in 1690 he proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the  as waves are not affected by gravity it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium

faraday s work inspired  to study electromagnetic radiation and light maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light from this maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation  he first stated this result in 1862 in on physical lines of force in 1873 he published  which contained a full mathematical description of the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields still known as  soon after  confirmed maxwell s theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light exhibiting properties such as reflection refraction diffraction and interference maxwell s theory and hertz s experiments led directly to the development of modern radio radar television electromagnetic imaging and wireless communications in the quantum theory photons are seen as  of the waves described in the classical theory of maxwell the quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that maxwell s classical theory could not  such as   quantum theory
in 1900  attempting to explain  suggested that although light was a wave these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency planck called these  lumps  of light energy  quanta   from a latin word for  how much  in 1905 albert einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the  and suggested that these light quanta had a  real  existence in 1923  showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity x-rays scattered from electrons  so called   could be explained by a particle-theory of x-rays but not a wave theory in 1926  named these light quanta particles  eventually the modern theory of  came to picture light as  in some sense  both a particle and a wave and  in another sense  as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave  which actually are macroscopic phenomena such as baseballs or ocean waves  instead modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor  particles  and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor  water waves  but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined as in the case for radio waves and the x-rays involved in compton scattering physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other visible light which occupies a middle ground in frequency can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model or sometimes both see also
