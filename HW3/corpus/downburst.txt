downburst seen from the  in huntsville alabama in 2012 note the winds in green going towards the radar and the winds in red going away from the radar 

a downburst is a strong ground-level  system that emanates from a point source above and blows  that is in a straight line in all directions from the point of contact at ground level often producing damaging winds it may be confused with a  where high-velocity winds circle a central area and air moves inward and upward  by contrast in a downburst winds are directed downward and then outward from the surface landing point downbursts are created by an area of significantly rain-cooled air that after reaching ground level spreads out in all directions producing strong winds dry downbursts are associated with  with very little rain while wet downbursts are created by thunderstorms with high amounts of rainfall  and macrobursts are downbursts at very small and larger scales respectively another variety the  is created by vertical currents on the backside of old outflow boundaries and  where rainfall is lacking heat bursts generate significantly higher temperatures due to the lack of rain-cooled air in their formation downbursts create vertical  or  which is dangerous to aviation

downburst damages in a straight line  source  


a downburst is created by a column of sinking air that after hitting ground level spreads out in all directions and is capable of producing damaging straight-line winds of over 240km h  150mph  often producing damage similar to but distinguishable from that caused by  this is because the physical properties of a downburst are completely different from those of a tornado downburst damage will radiate from a central point as the descending column spreads out when hitting the surface whereas tornado damage tends towards convergent damage consistent with rotating winds to differentiate between tornado damage and damage from a downburst the term straight-line winds is applied to damage from microbursts downbursts are particularly strong  from thunderstorms downbursts in air that is  free or contains  are known as dry downbursts  those accompanied with precipitation are known as wet downbursts most downbursts are less than 4km  2.5mi  in extent  these are called  downbursts larger than 4km  2.5mi  in extent are sometimes called macrobursts downbursts can occur over large areas in the extreme case a  can cover a huge area more than 320km  200mi  wide and over 1,600km  1,000mi  long lasting up to 12 hours or more and is associated with some of the most intense straight-line winds but the generative process is somewhat different from that of most downbursts straight-line winds

straight-line winds  also known as plough winds thundergusts and hurricanes of the prairie  are very strong winds that can produce damage demonstrating a lack of the rotational damage pattern associated with  straight-line winds are common with the  of a thunderstorm or originate with a downburst from a thunderstorm these events can cause considerable damage even in the absence of a tornado the winds can gust to 210km h  130mph  and winds of 93km h  58mph  or more can last for more than twenty minutes in the united states such straight-line wind events are most common during the spring when instability is highest and weather fronts routinely cross the country  straight-line wind events in the form of  can take place throughout the eastern half of the u.s straight-line winds may be damaging to marine interests small ships cutters and sailboats are at risk from this meteorological phenomenon the formation of a downburst starts with  or large  falling through drier air hailstones melt and raindrops evaporate pulling  from surrounding air and cooling it considerably cooler air has a higher density than the warmer air around it so it sinks to the ground as the cold air hits the ground it spreads out and a   can be observed as a  areas under and immediately adjacent to the downburst are the areas which receive the highest winds and rainfall if any is present also because the rain-cooled air is descending from the middle troposphere a significant drop in temperatures is noticed due to interaction with the ground the downburst quickly loses strength as it fans out and forms the distinctive  curl shape  that is commonly seen at the periphery of the microburst  see image  downbursts usually last only a few minutes and then dissipate except in the case of squall lines and derecho events however despite their short lifespan microbursts are a serious hazard to aviation and property and can result in substantial damage to the area heat bursts 
main article  
a special and much rarer kind of downburst is a  which results from precipitation-evaporated air compressionally heating as it descends from very high altitude usually on the backside of a dying  or outflow boundary heat bursts are chiefly a nocturnal occurrence can produce winds over 160km h  100mph  are characterized by exceptionally dry air and can suddenly raise the surface temperature to 38c  100f  or more sometimes persisting for several hours danger to aviation 
further information  
downbursts particularly microbursts are exceedingly dangerous to aircraft which are taking off or landing due to the strong vertical  caused by these events a number of fatal crashes have been attributed to downbursts see also
