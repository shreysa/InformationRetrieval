development
during the era in which the  company would develop the hurricane  consisted of just 13 squadrons each equipped with either the   or the  all  furnished with fixed wooden propellers and non-retractable undercarriages at the time there was an institutional reluctance towards change within the   according to aviation author francis k mason some senior figures were prejudiced against the adoption of  fighter aircraft while mid-level officers were typically approachable on the subject and design concepts that made use of such configurations in 1934 the british  issued  in response to demands within the   raf  for a new generation of  earlier during 1933 british aircraft designer  had conducted discussions with major john buchanan of the directorate of technical development on a monoplane based on the existing fury mason attributes camm s discussions with figures within the raf such as squadron leader  as having provoked the specification and some of its details such as the preference for armaments being installed within the wings instead of within the aircraft s nose camm s initial submission in response to f.7 30 the  was essentially a scaled-up version of the fury biplane however the p.v.3 was not among the proposals which the air ministry had selected to be constructed as a government-sponsored prototype after the rejection of the p.v.3 proposal camm commenced work upon a new design involving a  monoplane arrangement complete with a fixed undercarriage armed with four machine guns and powered by the  engine the original 1934 armament specifications for what would evolve into the hurricane were for a similar armament fitment to the   four machine-guns two in the wings and two in the fuselage  to fire through the propeller arc by january 1934 the proposal s detail drawings had been finished but these failed to impress the air ministry enough for a prototype to be ordered camm s response to this rejection was to further develop the design during which a retractable undercarriage was introduced and the unsatisfactory goshawk engine was replaced by a new rolls-royce design initially designated as the pv-12 which would subsequently go on to become famous as the  engine in august 1934 a one-tenth scale model of the design was produced and dispatched to the  at  a series of  tests confirmed the aerodynamic qualities of the aircraft were in order and in september 1934 camm again approached the air ministry this time the ministry s response was favourable and a prototype of the  interceptor monoplane  was promptly ordered prototype and trials

in november 1934 the air ministry issued specification f.5 34 which drawing on the work of squadron leader ralph sorley called for new fighter aircraft to be armed with a total of eight guns however by this time work had progressed too far to immediately modify the planned four-gun installation by january 1935 a wooden mock-up had been finished and although a number of suggestions for detail changes were made construction of the prototype was approved and a new specification  f.36 34  was written around the design in july 1935 this specification was amended to include installation of eight guns by the end of august 1935 work on the airframe performed at hawker s  facility had been completed and the aircraft components were transported to   where hawker had an assembly shed  on 23 october 1935 the prototype was fully re-assembled ground testing and taxi trials took place over the following two weeks on 6 november 1935 the prototype k5083 took to the air for the  at the hands of hawker s chief    bulman was assisted by two other pilots in subsequent flight testing   flew some of the experimental test flights while  conducted the firm s production flight trials as completed the prototype had been fitted with  to represent the aircraft s armament prior to the acceptance of the final multi-gun wing armament by march 1936 a total of ten flying hours had been performed by the prototype covering all major portions of the flight envelope  early flight testing had gone reasonably well especially in light of the trial status of the merlin engine which had itself yet to achieve full flight certification at this time and thus severe restrictions had been imposed upon use of the engine in early 1936 the prototype was transferred to   to participate in initial service trials under the direction of squadron leader d f anderson sammy wroath later to be the founding commandant of the  was the raf test pilot for the hurricane  his report was favorable stating that   the aircraft is simple and easy to fly and has no apparent vices  and proceeded to praise its control response

in the course of raf trials despite the merlin engine proving to be problematic having suffered numerous failures and necessitating several changes enthusiastic reports were produced in the aircraft and its performance figures the trials had observed the aircraft to possess a maximum level speed of 315 mph at an altitude of 16,200ft a time-to-climb to an altitude of 15,000ft from takeoff of 5.7 minutes and a stalling speed of 57 mph  only marginally higher than the gladiator biplane  the last achieved using its  in the course of further testing it was found that the hurricane had poor  recovery characteristics in which all  authority could be lost due to shielding of the rudder hawker s response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived but the air ministry refused the request  the situation was resolved by the   rae  who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral  and extension of the bottom of the rudder this discovery had come too late for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft in early 1936 the hawker  had decided in the absence of official authorisation and at company expense to proceed with issuing the design drawings to the production design office and to commence tooling-up for a production line capable of producing a batch of 1,000 hurricanes production

in june 1936 the hurricane was formally ordered into production the air ministry having placed its first order that month for 600 aircraft on 26 june 1936 the type name  hurricane  which had been proposed by hawker was approved by the air ministry  an informal christening ceremony for the aircraft was carried out during the following month during an official visit by  to martlesham heath a key reason for the aircraft s appeal was its relatively simple construction and ease of manufacture in comparison to the  it was significantly cheaper and involved less labour requiring 10,300 man hours to produce versus 15,200 for the spitfire as a large-scale war was looking increasingly likely and time was of the essence in providing the raf with an effective fighter aircraft it was unclear if the more advanced spitfire would enter production smoothly while the hurricane made use of well-understood manufacturing techniques this factor was equally applicable for its use within service squadrons as well which were experienced in working on and repairing aircraft whose construction employed the same principles as the hurricane and the simplicity of its design enabled the improvisation of some remarkable repairs in squadron workshops a fabric-covered wing patterned upon traditional hawker designs was initially adopted in order to speed up production  a higher-performing stressed-skin metal wing took its place in late 1939 on 12 october 1937 the maiden flight took place of the first production hurricane i which was powered by a merlin ii engine and flown by flight lieutenant philip lucas production deliveries had been delayed by roughly six months due to a decision to equip the hurricane only with the improved merlin ii engine while the earlier merlin i had been prioritised for the  and the  by the following december the first four aircraft to enter service with the raf had joined  stationed at  by february 1938 no 111 squadron had received 16 hurricanes upon the outbreak of the second world war nearly 500 hurricanes had been produced which had equipped a total of 18 squadrons while a further 3,500 aircraft were on order during 1940  who was the  established an organisation in which a number of manufacturers were seconded to repair and overhaul battle-damaged hurricanes the  also overhauled battle-weary aircraft which were later sent to training units or to other air forces  one of the factories involved was the  s  another was david rosenfield ltd based at  aerodrome near  a major manufacturer of the hurricane was  at their factory in    the facility s chief engineer  became known as the  queen of the hurricanes  the initiative was commercially led rather than governmentally but was endorsed by the british government  hawker having recognised that a major conflict was all but inevitable after the  of 1938 drew up preliminary plans to expand hurricane production via a new factory in canada under this plan samples pattern aircraft and a complete set of design documents stored on  were shipped to canada  22 early british-produced hurricanes were transferred to support the development as a result canadian-built hurricanes were shipped to britain to participate in events such as the  overall some 14,000 hurricanes and sea hurricanes were produced  the majority of hurricanes were built by hawker  who produced the type until 1944  while hawker s sister company the  constructed 2,750 the austin aero company completed 300 hurricanes canada car and foundry was responsible for the production of 1,400 hurricanes designated as the mk x in 1939 production of 100 hurricanes was initiated in  by  and  of these 20 were built by zmaj by april 1941 recognising that the supply of british-made merlin engines might not be guaranteed it was decided to fit one of the yugoslavian hurricanes with a  engine instead  this aircraft was  in 1941 in 1938 a contract for 80 hurricanes was placed with fairey s belgian subsidiary  for the   it was intended to arm these aircraft with an arrangement of four 13.2mm  three were built and two flown with this armament by the time of the  in may 1940 with at least 12 more constructed by avions fairey armed with the conventional eight rifle calibre machine gun armament design

the hawker hurricane is a low-wing   outfitted with retractable undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit for the pilot a clean single-seat fighter it was developed to provide a competent combatant for aerial combat against the latest fighter designs that were emerging amongst the air services of other powers of the era the hurricane was initially armed with an arrangement of eight remotely-operated wing-mounted browning machine guns intended for conducting rapid engagements the hurricane was typically equipped for flying under both day and night conditions being provided with navigation lights harley  complete blind-flying equipment and two-way  upon its entry to service much of the performance data was intentionally concealed from the general public but it was known that the type possessed a speed range of 6 1 though faster and more advanced than the raf s current front line biplane fighters the design of the hurricane s construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior the primary structure comprised a  box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel  and  cross-bracing which were mechanically fastened instead of  over this a secondary structure composed of wooden  and  gave the fuselage a rounded external shape which carried a   covering the majority of the external surfaces were linen save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead similarly a simple steel tube structure in the nose of the fuselage was used to support the engine  detachable panels across the cowling provided access to most of the engine s areas for inspection or adjustment purposes installed underneath the fuselage the liquid-cooled radiator has a rectangular opening to its aft  this is covered by a hinged flap via which the pilot was able to actively vary the cooling level an atypical feature for the era was the use of  pipes throughout the cooling system initially the structure of the hurricane s  wing consisted of two steel spars which possessed considerable strength and stiffness the wing was described by aviation publication  as being relatively straightforward to manufacture employing simple vertical  to attach the two spars after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts forming separate units between the front and rear sparsactuated split   were present on the inner end of the wings the original wing was predominantly fabric-covered like the fuselage while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its  the majority of the  such as the frise-type  also had fabric coverings an all-metal stressed-skin wing of   a derd specification similar to aa2024  was introduced in april 1939 and was used for all of the later marks  the metal skinned wings allowed a diving speed that was 80mph  130km h  higher than the fabric-covered ones they were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings  one trials hurricane l1877 was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing the great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath  several fabric-wing hurricanes were still in service during the battle of britain although a good number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair changing the wings only required three hours work per aircraft the hurricane was furnished with a laterally-retracting  the main undercarriage units being able to slide into recesses within the wing hinged telescopic vickers-built legs are attached to the bottom boom of the wing s forward spar but with a  within the wing at the top of the strut to allow the strut to be angled forwards when extended and rearwards when retracted to clear the forward spar a hydraulic jack served to actuate the undercarriage folding and pivoting the legs as to reposition the wheel unit rearwards well as inwards in order to clear the front spar when retracted two separate hydraulic systems one being power-operated and the other hand operated are present for the deployment and retraction of the undercarriage  in the event of both failing pilots can release the retaining catches holding the undercarriage in place deploying the wheels to the  down  position using weight alone a wide wheel-track was used to allow for considerable stability during ground movements and to enable tight turns to be performed the prototype and early production hurricanes were fitted with a watts two-bladed fixed-pitch wooden propeller  commented of this arrangement   many have expressed surprise that the hurricane is not fitted with variable-pitch airscrews  the original two-bladed propeller was found to be inefficient at low airspeeds and the aircraft required a long ground run to get airborne which caused concern at fighter command accordingly trials with a   demonstrated a reduction in the hurricane s take-off run from 1,230 to 750ft  370 to 230m  deliveries of these began in april 1939  this was later replaced by the hydraulically operated constant-speed  propeller which came into service in time for the battle of britain 

then with tail trimmer set throttle and mixture lever fully forward and puffs of grey exhaust smoke soon clearing at maximum r.p.m came the surprise  there was no sudden surge of acceleration but with a thunderous roar from the exhausts just ahead on either side of the windscreen only a steady increase in speed in retrospect that first hurricane sortie was a moment of elation but also of relief apart from the new scale of speeds that the pilot had to adapt to the hurricane had all the qualities of its stable secure biplane predecessor the  but enhanced by livelier controls greater precision and all this performance 
 a trainee pilot describing his first flight in a hurricane camm s priority was to provide the pilot with good all-round visibility to this end the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage creating a distinctive  hump-backed  silhouette pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable   mounted below the trailing edge of the port wing this was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage just behind the cockpit when the flap was shut the footstep retracted into the fuselage in addition both  were coated with strips of non-slip material an advantage of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding even if one of the steel tubes were damaged the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by ground crew at the airfield damage to a  structure as used by the spitfire required more specialised equipment to repair the old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions crated hurricanes were assembled at  in west africa and flown across the sahara to the middle east theatre and to save space some  aircraft carriers carried their reserve sea hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed in contrast the contemporary spitfire used all-metal  construction and was thus both lighter and stronger though less tolerant to bullet damage with its ease of maintenance widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics the hurricane remained in use in theatres of operations where reliability easy handling and a stable gun platform were more important than performance typically in roles like ground attack one of the design requirements of the original specification was that both the hurricane and the spitfire were also to be used as  the hurricane proved to be a relatively simple aircraft to fly at night and shot down several german aircraft on night raids from early 1941 the hurricane was also used as an  intruder  aircraft patrolling german airfields in france at night to catch bombers taking off or landing operational history

by the middle of 1938 the first 50 hurricanes had reached squadrons and at that time it had been assessed that the rate of production was slightly greater than the raf s capacity to introduce the new aircraft which had already been accelerated accordingly the british government gave hawker the clearance to sell excess aircraft to nations that were likely to oppose german expansion as a result there were some modest export sales made to other countries  at the earliest opportunity a former raf hurricane i was dispatched to  for evaluation purposes shortly after this evaluation an order for 24 hurricane mark is for the  was received  this was followed by the purchase of a  for the hurricane by yugoslavia yugoslavia hurricanes saw action against the  during the  in 1941 by the  hurricane production was increased as part of a plan to create a reserve of  aircraft as well as re-equip existing squadrons and newly formed ones such as those of the  expansion scheme e included a target of 500 fighters of all types by the start of 1938 by the time of the  there were only two fully operational raf squadrons of the planned 12 to be equipped with hurricanes by the time of the  there were 18 operational hurricane squadrons and three more that were in the process of converting

while the opening months of the war were characterised by little air activity in general there were sporadic engagements and aerial skirmishes between the two sides on 30 october 1939 hurricanes saw action over france that day pilot officer  of 1 squadron flying hurricane l1842 shot down a p from 2 f 123 the german aircraft sent to photograph allied airfields close to the border fell in flames about 10 miles  16km  west of  mould was the first raf pilot to down an enemy aircraft on the european continent in the second world war according to mason the experiences gained in these early engagements proved invaluable in developing tactics which became tried and tested and rapidly spread throughout fighter command on 6 november 1939 pilot officer  from 73 squadron was the first to clash with a  after the dogfight he came back with five holes in his fuselage   a new zealander was responsible for 73 squadron s first victory on 8 november 1939 while stationed at  he went on to become one of the raf s first  of the war being credited with 16 kills on 22 december the hurricanes in france suffered their first losses  three of them while trying to intercept an unidentified aircraft between  and  were jumped by four bf 109es from iii jg 53 with their   ace captain  in the lead mlders and leutnant  shot down the hurricanes of sergeant r m perry and j winn for no loss battle of france

by 17 may the end of the first week of fighting only three of the squadrons were near operational strength but the hurricanes had managed to destroy nearly twice as many german aircraft on 18 may 1940 air combat continued from dawn to dusk  hurricane pilots claimed 57 german aircraft and 20 probables  luftwaffe records show 39 aircraft lost  the following day 1 and 73 squadrons claimed 11 german aircraft  three by  cobber  kain and three by paul richey  on these two days hurricanes suffered heavier losses with 68 hurricanes shot down or forced to crash-land due to combat damage fifteen pilots were killed eight were taken prisoner and 11 injured two-thirds of the hurricanes had been shot down by messerschmitt bf 109s and  in the afternoon of 20 may 1940 the hurricane units based in northern france were ordered to abandon their bases on the continent and return to great britain on the same day  bull  halahan requested the repatriation of the pilots serving in 1 squadron during the previous 10 days the unit had been the most successful of the campaign  it had claimed 63 victories for the loss of five pilots  two killed one taken prisoner and two hospitalised 1 squadron was awarded ten dfcs and three dfms during the blitzkrieg on the evening of 21 may the only hurricanes still operational were those of the  that had been moved to bases around  during the 11 days of fighting in france and over dunkirk from 1021 may hurricane pilots claimed 499 kills and 123 probables contemporary german records examined postwar attribute 299 luftwaffe aircraft destroyed and 65 seriously damaged by raf fighters the last 66 hurricanes of the 452 engaged during the battle of france left france on 21 june  178 were abandoned at several airfields notably   and   operation dynamo 
during   the evacuation from dunkirk of british french and belgian troops cut off by the german army during the   the hawker hurricanes operated from british bases between 26 may and 3 june 1940 the 14 hurricane units involved were credited with 108 air victories a total of 27 hurricane pilots became aces during operation dynamo led by canadian pilot officer w l   10 victories  and pilot officer   seven victories  who served in no 242 squadron consisting mostly of canadian personnel losses were 22 pilots killed and three captured 

over dunkirk the luftwaffe suffered its first serious rebuff of the war as galland has noted the nature and style of the air battles over the beaches should have provided a warning as to the inherent weaknesses of the luftwaffe s force structure admittedly the germans fought at a disadvantage although positioned forward at captured airfields the bf 109 was at the outer limits of its range and possessed less flying time over dunkirk than did the  hurricanes  and  spitfires  operating from southern england german bombers were still located in western germany and had even farther to fly thus the luftwaffe could not bring its full weight to bear so that when its bombers hammered those on the beaches or embarking the raf intervened in a significant fashion german aircraft losses were high and british fighter attacks often prevented german bombers from performing with full effectiveness both sides suffered heavy losses during the nine days from may 26 through june 3 the raf lost 177 aircraft destroyed or damaged  the germans lost 240 for much of the luftwaffe dunkirk came as a nasty shock fliegerkorps ii reported in its war diary that it lost more aircraft on the 27th attacking the evacuation than it had lost in the previous ten days of the campaign

at the end of june 1940 following the fall of france the majority of the raf s 36 fighter squadrons were equipped with hurricanes the  officially lasted from 10 july until 31 october 1940 but the heaviest fighting took place between 8 august and 21 september both the supermarine spitfire and the hurricane are renowned for their part in defending britain against the luftwaffe  generally the spitfire would intercept the german fighters leaving hurricanes to concentrate on the bombers but despite the undoubted abilities of the  thoroughbred  spitfire it was the  workhorse  hurricane that scored the higher number of raf victories during this period accounting for 55 percent of the 2,739 german losses according to fighter command compared with 42 per cent by spitfires on 8 august 1940 hurricanes of  were recorded as having fired the first shots of the battle of britain 

another thing we did was to devise a manoeuvre which was aimed at getting us out of a difficult corner if we ever got into one this may sound very extraordinary probably to practising pilots today but it consisted of putting everything into the left hand front corner of the cockpit if you saw a 109 on your tail and it hadn t shot you down at that point you put on full throttle fine pitch full left rudder full left stick and full forward stick this resulted in a horrible manoeuvre which was in fact a negative g spiral dive but you would come out of the bottom with no 109 on your tail and your aeroplane intact 
 describing how a hurricane can get away from an me109 as a fighter the hurricane had some drawbacks it was slightly slower than both the spitfire i and ii and the messerschmitt bf 109e and the thicker wing profiles compromised acceleration  but it could out-turn both of them in spite of its performance deficiencies against the bf 109 the hurricane was still capable of destroying the german fighter especially at lower altitudes the standard tactic of the 109s was to attempt to climb higher than the raf fighters and  bounce  them in a dive  the hurricanes could evade such tactics by turning into the attack or going into a  corkscrew dive  which the 109s with their lower rate of roll found hard to counter if a 109 was caught in a dogfight the hurricane was just as capable of out-turning the 109 as the spitfire in a stern chase the 109 could evade the hurricane in september 1940 the more powerful mk iia series 1 hurricanes started entering service although only in small numbers this version was capable of a maximum speed of 342mph  550km h  the hurricane was a steady gun platform and had demonstrated its ruggedness as several were badly damaged yet returned to base but the hurricane s construction made it dangerous if it caught fire  the wood frames and fabric covering of the rear fuselage allowed fire to spread through the rear fuselage structure easily in addition the gravity fuel tank in the forward fuselage sat right in front of the instrument panel without any form of protection for the pilot many hurricane pilots were seriously burned as a consequence of a jet of flame which could burn through the instrument panel this became of such concern to  that he had hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of the hurricanes with a self-expanding rubber coating called  if the tank happened to be punctured by a bullet the linatex coating would expand when soaked with petrol and seal it some hurricane pilots also felt that the fuel tanks in the wings although they were protected with a layer of linatex were vulnerable from behind and it was thought that these not the fuselage tank were the main fire risk

the hawker hurricane was the first allied  aircraft to be delivered to the  with a total of 2,952 hurricanes eventually delivered becoming the most numerous british aircraft in  service many soviet pilots were disappointed by the hawker fighter regarding it as inferior to both german and russian aircraft during 1941 mk ii hurricanes played an important air defence role when the soviet union found itself under threat from the approaching german army who were advancing across a broad front stretching from  and  to the oil fields in the south britain s decision to aid the soviets meant sending supplies by sea to the far northern ports and as the convoys would need to sail within range of enemy air attack from the luftwaffe based in neighbouring finland it was decided to deliver a number of hurricane mk iibs flying with  and  of  to provide protection twenty-four were transported on the   arriving just off  on 28 august 1941 and another 15 crated aircraft on board merchant vessels in addition to their convoy protection duties the aircraft also acted as escorts to russian bombers enemy attention to the area declined in october at which point the raf pilots trained their soviet counterparts to operate the hurricanes themselves by the end of the year the raf s direct role in the region had ended but the aircraft themselves remained behind and became the first of thousands of allied aircraft that were accepted by the soviet union although soviet pilots were not universally enthusiastic about the hurricane twice  lt col   loved the hurricane  and raf hurricane mk iib fighters operating from soviet soil in defence of murmansk destroyed 15 luftwaffe aircraft for only one loss in combat however in some soviet war memoirs the hurricane has been described in very unflattering terms the  soviet  iib hurricane as a multi-role fighter-bomber had quite a few drawbacks first of all it was 4050km h  25 31mph  slower than its main opponent the bf 109e interceptor at low and medium height and had a slower rate of climb the messerschmitt could outdive the hurricane because of the thicker wing profile of the british fighter but the main source of complaints was the hurricane s armament on occasion the eight or 12 small-calibre machine guns did not damage the sturdy and heavily armoured german aircraft  consequently soviet ground crews started to remove the brownings retaining only four or six of the 12 machine guns two 12.7mm  or two or even four 20mm  were substituted but overall performance deteriorated as a result burma ceylon singapore and the netherlands east indies

sea hurricane mk ia
the sea hurricane mk ia was a hurricane mk i modified by  these conversions numbered approximately 250 aircraft they were modified to be carried by  armed   whose ships  crews were merchant marine and whose hurricanes were crewed and serviced by raf personnel or fighter catapult ships which were naval auxiliary vessels crewed by naval personnel and aircraft operated by the fleet air arm these ships were equipped with a catapult for launching an aircraft but without facilities to recover them consequently if the aircraft were not in range of a land base pilots had to bail out or to ditch both of these options had their problemsthere was always a chance of striking part of the fuselage when bailing out and a number of pilots had been killed in this way ditching the hurricane in the sea called for skill as the radiator housing acted as a water brake pitching the nose of the fighter downwards when it hit the water while also acting as a very efficient scoop helping to flood the hurricane so that a quick exit was necessary before the aircraft sank then the pilot had to be picked up by a ship more than 80 modifications were needed to convert a hurricane into a sea hurricane including new radios to conform with those used by the fleet air arm and new instrumentation to read in knots rather than miles per hour they were informally known as  hurricats  the majority of the aircraft modified had suffered wear-and-tear serving with front line squadrons so much so that at least one example used during trials broke up under the stress of a catapult launching cam sea hurricanes were launched operationally on eight occasions and the hurricanes shot down six enemy aircraft for the loss of one hurricane pilot killed the first sea hurricane ia kill was an  shot down on 2 august 1941
