hurricane opal near peak intensity on october4


although opal was a weak system located over the yucatn peninsula at the time 350people evacuated from  on september28 after rough surf associated with the distant cyclone began to threaten the only thoroughfare connecting grand isle with the louisianan mainland the following day oil companies operating  in the gulf of mexico began evacuating workers from the rigs to land on october1 a coastal flood watch was issued for portions of the united states coast due to the risk of  from opal the  issued an advisory for boaters in the gulf of mexico to use caution or remain in port where possible the next day the  emergency operations center opened to monitor the tropical cyclone and deliberate upon potential preparations for the city meanwhile the launch  s  mission set for october5 was postponed due to opal s anticipated effects on october 3 a voluntary evacuation order was placed on  due to the risks of potential storm surge schools were also closed by noon that day across the parish voluntary evacuation orders for the florida panhandle which would ultimately be the most heavily affected area also began the same day with several counties giving evacuation orders farther west a mandatory evacuation order was placed on  by then  just before noon october 4 with the hurricane near landfall   and  halted evacuations instead ordering those still within vulnerable areas to seek shelter instead however the large amount of evacuees led to severe   escambia county officials estimated that  tens of thousands  were still on evacuation routes within the county only a few hours before opal made landfall mass evacuations in some other counties concluded during the afternoon of october 4 though many evacuees in other locations were unable to reach safe areas prior to the onset of gale-force winds an estimated 100,000people evacuated from the united states gulf coast ahead of opal with 5 percent of evacuees seeking public shelters and over half of evacuees seeking shelter out of their home counties  in their post-storm assessment the  fema  noted that the landfalls of  and  on the florida panhandle earlier in the year produced a dichotomous mood toward preparations for hurricane opalsome people may have taken a  wait and see  approach that resulted in complacency while others affected by the widespread power outages caused by erin may have acquired a greater sense of readiness toward the approaching hurricane regardless the overall evacuation process was described as chaotic and the failure to clear  of casual or communal traffic was blamed for the relative unease during evacuations for opal traffic congestion on these routes caused some evacuees to return to vulnerable areas along the coast while raising fears that stranded evacuees on highways could be subjected to potentially fatal hurricane-force winds the post-landfall watches and warnings released in accordance with opal were a flash flood warning released on october 5 for portions of  northern  and the western parts of  and  the warning also included eastern  a flash flood watch was also in effect for portions of the  the  region the central  and the lower  wind warnings were in effect for northwestern south carolina all the way to western  a gale watch was also in effect for   and the southern sections of the  six hours later the gale warnings over   and the southern sections of the  were upgraded into a storm warning for erie alone the gale warning for the other two sections remained the shoreline of lake erie was under a beach erosion warning from  to  the storm prediction center released a tornado watch for northern and central  and portions of  and  on october 6 significant non-surge areas of  south of  were included in evacuation areas because of the potential for isolation by flooding tropical cyclone watches and warnings
although opal was only a weak tropical storm when it affected the yucatn peninsula its slow movement led to prolonged flooding rains over much of the region  received about 20 percent of its annual rainfall in four days across  and tabasco more than 42,000 people were forced to evacuate as rivers overtopped their banks according to  an estimated 100,000 people evacuated due to the storm by october1 an estimated 500,000acres of crops had been destroyed by the floods in  flood waters reached a depth of 6ft  1.8m  governor jorge salomon ordered the closure of all government offices businesses and schools by october2 in light of the extensive flooding at least 60towns across the state were isolated by flooding by october 3 agricultural losses in campeche alone were estimated in the billions of pesos  hundreds of millions of dollars  at least 19 people perished across mexico while another 31 were killed in guatemala florida
