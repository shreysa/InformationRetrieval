in the  anticyclonic storms involve clockwise wind flow  in the  they involve counterclockwise wind flow  storms usually form around  these do not  contradict  the   it predicts such anticyclonic flow about high-pressure regions anticyclonic storms as high-pressure systems usually accompany cold weather and are frequently a factor in large    is a well-known extraterrestrial example of an anticyclonic system  often occur  while tornadoes   are low-pressure regions this occurs because tornadoes occur on a small enough scale such that the coriolis effect is negligible references
