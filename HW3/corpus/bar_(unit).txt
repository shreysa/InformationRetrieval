the bar is a metric  of  but is not approved as part of the   si  it is defined as exactly equal to 100,000 which is slightly less than the current average  on earth at  the bar and the millibar were introduced by the norwegian meteorologist  who was a founder of the modern practice of  use of the bar is  by professional bodies in some fields the   bipm   the bar as one of the  non-si units  should have the freedom to use  but declines to include it among the  non-si units accepted for use with the si  the us   nist  deprecates its use except for  limited use in   and lists it as one of several units that  must not be introduced in fields where they are not presently used  the   iau  also lists it under  non-si units and symbols whose continued use is deprecated  as of 2004 the bar is legally recognized in countries of the  units derived from the bar include the megabar  symbol  mbar  kilobar  symbol  kbar  decibar  symbol  dbar  centibar  symbol  cbar  and millibar  symbol  mbar or mb  the notation bar g  though deprecated by various bodies represents  i.e pressure in bars above ambient or atmospheric pressure

definition and conversion 
the bar is defined using the    70051000000000000001bar  100,000 pa  100,000 n m2 thus 70051000000000000001bar is equal to 

1,000,000 ba    in  

and 1 bar is approximately equal to

origin 
the word bar has its origin in the  word   baros  meaning  the unit s official symbol is bar  the earlier symbol b is now deprecated and conflicts with the use of b denoting the unit  but it is still encountered especially as mb  rather than the proper mbar  to denote the millibar between 1793 and 1795 the word bar was used for a unit of weight in an early version of the metric system usage 
 is often given in millibars where  at  is defined as 1013.25 mbar 101.325 1.01325bar which is about 14.7  despite the millibar not being an  unit meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibars as the values are convenient after the advent of si units some meteorologists began using   symbol hpa  which are numerically equivalent to millibars  for the same reason the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries for example the weather office of  uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps in contrast americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in us reports of  and other cyclonic storms 
in fresh water there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibars and the change in depth from the water surface in  specifically an increase of 1 decibar occurs for every 1.019716m increase in depth in sea water with respect to the gravity variation the latitude and the geopotential anomaly the pressure can be converted into meters depth according to an empirical formula  unesco tech paper 44 p.25  as a result decibars are commonly used in  many engineers worldwide use the bar as a unit of pressure because in much of their work using pascals would involve using very large numbers engineers that specialize in technical safety for offshore petrochemical facilities would be expected to exclusively refer to explosion loads in units of bar or bars a bar is a convenient unit of measure for pressures generated by low frequency vapor cloud explosions that are commonly considered as part of accidental loading risk studies

in the automotive field  boost is often described in bars outside the usa  is often specified in bar  has characters for  mb    u 33d4  and  bar    u 3374  but they exist only for compatibility with legacy asian encodings and are not intended to be used in new documents the kilobar equivalent to 100mpa is commonly used in geological systems particularly in experimental   bar a  and  bara  are sometimes used to indicate  and  bar g  and  barg  for  this usage is deprecated and fuller descriptions such as  gauge pressure of 2 bar  or  2 bar gauge  are recommended see also
