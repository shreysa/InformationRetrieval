the natural geography can be categoried into nine regions  the sierra de zongolica the tecolutla region the huayacocotla region the metlac river area the tuxtlas region the central region the laguna del castillo region the pueblo viejo-tamiahua region and the laguna de alvarado region the topography changes drastically rising from the narrow coastal plains to the highlands of the eastern sierra madre elevation varies from sea level to the  mexicos highest peak at 5,636m  18,491ft  above sea level the coast consists of low sandy strips interspersed with tidewater streams and lagoons most of the long coastline is narrow and sandy with unstable dunes small shifting lagoons and points the mountains are of the sierra madre oriental and the  mountain ranges include the sierra de topila sierra de otontepec sierra de huayacocotla sierra de coxquihui sierra de chiconquiaco sierra de jalacingo sierra de axocuapan sierra de huatusco sierra de zongolica and the sierra de los tuxtla major peaks include pico de orizaba  5,636m 18,491ft    4,282m 14,048.6ft  cerro de tecomates  3,227m 10,587ft  cerro del viga alta  3,055m 10,023ft  and cerro de 3 tortas  2,997m 9,833ft  the pico de orizaba is covered in snow year round  the cofre de perote is covered in winter major valleys include the acultzingo crdoba maltrata orizaba and san andrs 






more than 40 rivers and tributaries provide water for irrigation and hydroelectric power  they also carry rich silt down from the eroding highlands which is deposited in the valleys and coastal areas all of the rivers and streams that cross the state begin in the sierra madre oriental or in the central mesa flowing east to the gulf of mexico the important ones include   acuatempan river ro blanco   ro de la antigua hueyapan river  nautla river      and  the largest in terms of water discharge are the pnuco tuxpan papaloapan coazocoalcos and  the panuco tuxpan papaloapan and coatzacoalcos are navigable two of mexico s most polluted rivers the coatzacoalcos and the ro blanco are located in the state much of the pollution comes from industrial sources but the discharge of sewerage and uncontrolled garbage disposal are also major contributors the state has very few sewage treatment plants with only 10 of sewage being treated before discharge the state also has ten major waterfalls and ten major coastal lagoons there is only one significant lake called  off the coast are the islands of isla de lobos isla de los burros  isla de salmendina isla del idolo isladel toro isla frijoles isla juan a ramirez isla pajaros and isla terrn and the ocean reefs called blanquilla medio tangillo tuxpan gualleguilla gallega anegada de adento anegada de afuera and cabezo climate 




mountain formation in the south of the state



the large variation of altitude results in a large mixture of climates from cold snow-topped mountain peaks to warm wet tropical areas on the coast 32 of the state is classified as hot and humid 52 as hot and semi humid 9 is warm and humid 6 as temperate and humid and 1 is classified as cold hot and humid and hot and semi-humid climates dominate from sea level to about 1,000m  3,280.8ft  above sea level average annual temperature ranges from 22 to 26c with precipitation varying from 2,000mm  78.7in  to just over 3,500mm  137.8in  per year cooler and humid climates are found at elevations between 1,000m  3,280.8ft  and 1,600m  5,249.3ft  these have an average temperature of between 18 and 22c with precipitation varying between 2,000mm  78.7in  and 2,500mm  98.4in  temperate climates are found at higher altitudes between 1,600m  5,249.3ft  and 2,800m  9,186.4ft  temperatures here vary from 12 to 18c with precipitation varying more between 500mm  19.7in  and 2,500mm  98.4in  cold climates are found at the highest elevations reaching up to the cofre de perote and the pico de orizaba there is a small semi arid region around the city of perote and the west of the huasteca area this is due to a  caused by the  and the  which do not permit the flow of moist gulf air to this region

the history of the native peoples of the state of veracruz is complex in the pre-columbian period the modern-day state of veracruz was inhabited primarily by four indigenous cultures the  and  occupied the north while the  resided in the north-center the  one of the oldest cultures in the americas became dominant in the southern part of veracruz remains of these past civilizations can be found in archeological sites such as pnuco  el zapotal las higueras quiahuiztln    and   the first major civilization in the territory of the current state was that of the olmecs the olmecs lived in the  region and it became the center of olmec culture the main ceremonial center here was san lorenzo tenochtitln other major centers in the state include tres zapotes in the city of veracruz and  in tabasco the culture reached its height about 2600 years ago with its best-known artistic expression being the  these ceremonial sites were the most complex of that early time period for this reason many anthropologists consider the olmec civilization to be the mother culture of the many mesoamerican cultures that followed it by 300 bce this culture was eclipsed by other emerging civilizations in mesoamerica another major group was the totonacs who have survived to the present day their region called  is centered between the cazones river and the papaloapan river in the north of the state pre-columbian totonacs lived from hunting fishing and agriculture mostly of corn beans chili peppers and squash this is also the native region of the  clay sculptures with smiling faces are indicative of this culture the major site is  located near  but the culture reached its apogee in cempoala  about five miles  8km  inland from the current port of veracruz  when it was conquered by the aztecs when the spaniards arrived in 1519 the territory was still home to a population of about 250,000 people living in fifty population centers and speaking four totonac dialects 25,000 were living in cempoala alone the  are in the far north of the veracruz and extend into parts of tamaulipas hidalgo san luis potos  and puebla the language and agricultural techniques of these people and the  are similar  however only a few buildings and ceramics remain from the early huastec culture this culture also reached its peak between 1200 and 1519 when it was conquered by the spanish during the 15th and very early 16th century the  came to dominate much of the state and dividing it into tributary provinces of tochtepec cuetlaxtlan cempoallan quauhtochco jalapa misantla and tlatlauhquitepec the aztecs were interested in the area s vegetation and crops such as cedars fruit cotton cacao corn beans and vanilla however the totonacs chafed under aztec rule with aztec rulers from  to  having to send soldiers to quell rebellions the huastecs were subjugated more successfully by the aztecs and relegated to the provinces of atlan and tochpan colonial period 15191821 




playa villa rica where the spanish built the first city of veracruz


veracruz played an important part in the  by  and his expedition members they founded villa rica de la vera cruz on may 18 1519 as the first spanish town in what is now mexico by doing so corts threw off the authority of the governor of cuba diego velquez and took authority from the town council  cabildo  of veracruz and claim authority directly from the spanish crown a small contingent of the expedition remained at veracruz while the main body of conquerors moved inland the  were the first people with whom the spanish had contact on the american mainland the very first contact was with captain  on the coastline north of the present-day city of veracruz still chafing under aztec rule totonac ruler  welcomed  and promised 50,000 warriors to help defeat  the spanish helped the totonacs expel aztec tribute collectors and to seize control of some aztec outposts the spanish founded the port city of veracruz on the coast as the first municipality under the direct control of the king of spain corts then began his march inland to tenochtitlan during the  the rest of the totonac peoples allied themselves with the spanish but the huastecs despite also being under aztec rule fought against them after the fall of tenochtitlan corts sent a regiment to subdue the huastecs during the early conquest era corts distributed the labor of indigenous settlements to particular conquerors in an institution known as  the indigenous ruler of the settlement was charged with mobilization labor and tribute that was due the holder of the encomienda veracruz had a number of encomiendas that changed hands a number of times but early on came under the direct control of the spanish crown rather than individual encomenderos during the colonial era veracruz was the main port of entry for immigrants from spain  and all types of luxury goods for import and export the first group of franciscans arrived in veracruz in 1524 walking barefoot to the capital of the spanish colony of  the route between veracruz and the spanish capital of mexico city built on the site of the aztec capital  was the key trade route during the colonial era much of the history of the state is involved with the port city that corts founded in 1519 veracruz became the principal and often only port to export and import goods between the colony of  and spain itself to ensure the ports monopoly it came to have control over almost all of new spain s gulf coastline new spain s silver and  red dye were the two most important exports from the port along with chocolate vanilla chili peppers and much more were exported imported were livestock  sheep cows goats horses  wheat and other cultivars from the caribbean slaves pineapple and sugar cane were introduced this made the port a highly prized target for pirates during the colonial period with attacks and sackings frequent this led to the building of the fort of  and the fortification of the city overall much of totonac and huastec culture have survived the colonial period into the present day much of the reason for this is that the north of veracruz is rugged with thick vegetation and relatively little of the resources the spanish were looking for veracruz is considered to be where the   or mixed european indigenous race began which is a large part of mexican cultural identity

though the spaniards had halted the azrtec wars and human sacrifices an unexpected problem arose  decimated the native population of the province prompting the importation of african slaves during the colonial period starting in the 16th century the spanish imported between 500,0001,000,000 west african slaves into mexico between 1535 and 1767   between indigenous and african population began almost immediately  new spain did not have any laws prohibiting interracial marriage hence the correct term is afro-mestizo which includes all 3 races  indigenous african and spanish runaway slaves  cimarrones  became problematic to public order since they frequently formed robber bands that attacked travelers on highways crown efforts against these groups began in earnest in the late sixteenth century but a major rebellion broke out in 1606 in the areas of villa rica nueva veracruz antn lizardo and the rio blanco area however the gravest of these occurred in the orizaba area where there were about 500 fugitive slaves in 1609 a leader named  led an insurrection against the spanish but was defeated in battle unrest continued eventually forcing the government to sign an amnesty pact and giving the africans the right to form their own community exacting as a condition that bandits be suppressed this was called san lorenzo de zerral but today it is known as the  this was the first time slavery was abolished in the americas in the first half of the seventeenth century cities such as   and  were formed or expanded to protect the trade route between mexico city and the port of veracruz during this time the spanish and mixed-race population increased as the purely indigenous population continued to fall to a fraction of pre-conquest levels  due now to mixing rather than disease  almost all trade in and out of new spain had to be with spain except for some limited trade authorized with england and other spanish colonies this would stay in place until 1778 when the decreto de libre comercio allowing a limited free trade within spanish-held realms lifted many of these restrictions on trade with europe this would make the port more important than it had been and led to increased prosperity for the inhabitants outside of the port in other areas of the province the economy was based on agriculture livestock and commerce in 1720 xalapa organized the first trade fair making it the center for trade between inland mexican goods and those from abroad this would lead to its eventual status as capital of the state in 1746 the state was divided into the civil jurisdictions of pnuco tampico huayacocotla huauchinango papantla misantla xalapa jalacingo veracruz crdoba orizaba cosamaloapan tuxtla and cotaxtla the port city of veracruz and the fort of san juan de ula where corts landed three hundred years earlier was where the loyalist soldiers of the spanish crown made their last stand against the independence movement in 1824 independence 




depiction of the battle of veracruz during the mexicanamerican war


during the  there was support for the insurgents in many parts of the state with skirmishes erupting in various parts as early as 1811 a major conspiracy against the colonial government was discovered in the port in 1812 with rebels taking  and  during the same year this forced royalist troops to withdraw to xalapa eventually this city along with the port were cut off from mexico city most of the state remained in rebel hands during the rest of the war although the commercial class of the port did not support the effort in 1821  the last  of new spain came to the port to leave for spain however until 1823 spanish troops continued to occupy san juan de ula fort in 1826 the city would receive the first of its four titles of  heroic city  for confronting these remaining spanish troops while the last of the spanish held on in san juan de ula  had been declared the emperor of mexico in 1822 however his reign quickly encountered resistance from those favoring a republican form of government including from  from his stronghold in veracruz state months later iturbide would go into exile and santa anna would eventually hold nine terms as president the french intervened in mexico through veracruz for the first time in the 1838 in what became the  the port was blockaded efforts to defend the country were coordinated from xalapa the port was bombarded but eventually a settlement was reached during the  the port was blockaded again this time by the americans initial american attempts in 1847 to land in  were checked but the americans then made a plan to land a few miles south of veracruz which surrendered after  defeated general  s forces at the  and marched inland through  towards mexico city led by general   mexico surrendered shortly after the municipalities of  and  belonged to puebla until 1853 when they were annexed to veracruz to give the state its final form in 1855 the state government palace was constructed during the  the major player was ignacio de la llave whose name is part of the state s official designation in 1858 the port became the site for the liberal government under  after he was forced out of mexico city during the reform war their control of this port and its customs duties allowed liberal forces to gather resources conservative forces attacked the state but were repelled from both the port and xalapa the reform war wrecked mexico s economy and it found itself unable to pay debts it owed to europe as a result jurez cancelled mexico s foreign debt spain britain and france all outraged by this action decided in october 1861 to force repayment of their loans by the occupation of the mexican gulf coast normally this move would have been blocked by the united states under the  however that nation was occupied with a civil war at the time and the european powers believed that the americans could not act in december spanish troops commanded by general manuel gasset occupied the port of veracruz without any local resistance followed a month later by french and british forces the spanish and the british withdrew after making deals with jurez but  to establish the reign of  however this was short-lived and the french were expelled through veracruz in 1866 67 in 1863 the state was officially named veracruz-llave after the french were expelled the state government was in the port of veracruz in 1878 the capital was transferred to orizaba it was later moved to xalapa in 1885 by the end of the century many infrastructure improvements such as roads and railways  especially the   had been completed with the major cities being veracruz orizaba xalapa crdoba  chicontepec and  the discovery of oil in the north of the state attracted foreign firms which brought machinery needed for its extraction these companies included huasteca company petroleum and el aguila along with american and english firms during the same time period uprisings against the government under  in the agricultural south of the state were brutally repressed 20th century to the present 
unrest against the daz regime continued until the outbreak of the  ousted him from power the major event leading up to this war in veracruz was the cigar-makers strike of 1905 when more than 5,000 workers of the  el valle nacional  company walked off the job the governor teodora a dehesa unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a settlement the strike went on for months until the strikers won this victory encouraged more actions until strikes at the factories in rio blanco nogales santa rosa and contn de orizaba resulted in  no major battles of the mexican revolution were fought in the state though there were skirmishes and attacks on the port by 1914 rebel cndido agular occupied a number of municipalities in the state and in 1917  transferred the federal government here temporarily on april 21 1914 an  led president  to land american troops in veracruz where they remained for six months mexico later responded by severing diplomatic relations after the revolution agrarian reform including the redistribution of land and the creation of ejidos took place here the oil companies in the north of the state were nationalized and consolidated into  in the 1930s by  in the 1950s more road construction such as the mexico city poza rica veracruz-alvarado coatzacoalco and tinajas-ciudad aleman-tlacoatalpan highways were constructed the  was expanded as well in 1960 the  was inaugurated as well as the coatzacoalco highway the  was opened in the 1970s economy 
veracruz has one of mexicos leading economies based on agriculture and petroleum using relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in comparison with gross county product the informal sector of the local economy in veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the fox administration though the regional government remained pri the assumption that the informal economy of mexico is a constant 30 of total economic activity is not supported at the local level the small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in veracruz but not enough to warrant including an i-statistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people while the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000 by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality while rural municipios have smaller economies they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues agriculture
