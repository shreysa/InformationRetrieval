in  a dimensionless quantity is a  to which no  is applicable it is also known as a bare number or a quantity of dimension one and the corresponding unit of measurement in the  is one  or 1  unit and it is not explicitly shown dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields such as    and  by contrast examples of quantities with dimensions are   and  which are measured in dimensional units such as   and

quantities having dimension 1 habitually called dimensionless quantities regularly occur in sciences and are formally treated within the field of  in the nineteenth century  mathematician  and  physicist  led significant developments in the modern concepts of  and  later work by  physicists  and  contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics building on rayleigh s method of dimensional analysis  proved the   independent of french mathematician  s previous work  to formalize the nature of these quantities numerous other dimensionless numbers mostly ratios were coined in the early 1900s particularly in the areas of  and  measuring ratios in the  derived  unit db   finds widespread use nowadays in the early  the  discussed naming the unit of 1 as the  uno  but the idea of just introducing a new si-name for 1 was dropped pure numbers 
all  are dimensionless quantities for example     and  units of number such as the    and  may also be considered dimensionless ratios proportions and angles 
dimensionless quantities are often obtained as  of  that are not dimensionless but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation examples include calculating  or  a more complex example of such a ratio is  a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length since both quantities have the dimension length their ratio is dimensionless another set of examples is  or  often written using  such as ppm  106  ppb  109  and ppt  1012  or more confusingly as ratios of two identical units  kg or  mol  for example  which characterizes the concentration of  in an  could be written as ml   100 ml other common proportions are percentages  0.01   0.001  and angle units such as   and  in  the  is the ratio of the  to the  and is used to measure the  in the  buckingham  theorem 
the  indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system a statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an  involving only dimensionless combinations  ratios or products  of the variables linked by the law  e g pressure and volume are linked by   they are inversely proportional  if the dimensionless combinations  values changed with the systems of units then the equation would not be an identity and buckingham s theorem would not hold another consequence of the theorem is that the  dependence between a certain number  say n  of  can be reduced by the number  say k  of   occurring in those variables to give a set of p   n  k independent dimensionless  for the purposes of the experimenter different systems that share the same description by dimensionless  are equivalent example 
to demonstrate the application of the  theorem consider the  consumption of a  with a given shape the power p in dimensions  m  l2 t3  is a function of the    m l3  and the  of the fluid to be stirred   m l  t  as well as the size of the stirrer given by its  d  and the  of the stirrer n  1 t  therefore we have a total of n   5 variables representing our example those n   5 variables are built up from k   3 fundamental dimensions the length  l   units    time  t   and mass  m   according to thetheorem the n   5 variables can be reduced by the k   3 dimensions to form p   n  k   5  3   2 independent dimensionless numbers these quantities are  commonly named the  which describes the fluid flow regime and  the  which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer dimensionless physical constants

certain fundamental physical constants such as the  in a vacuum the   and  can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for     and  are chosen the resulting  is known as the  however not all  can be normalized in this fashion for example the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units and must be determined experimentally

main article  
physics often uses dimensionless  to simplify the characterization of systems with multiple interacting physical phenomena these may be found by applying the  or otherwise may emerge from making  unitless by the process of  engineering economics and other fields often extend these ideas in  and analysis of the relevant systems physics and engineering 

  wavenumber over distance
 is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize flow incorporating both properties of the fluid and the flow it is interpreted as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and can indicate flow regime as well as correlate to frictional heating in application to flow in pipes   ratio of the speed of an object or flow relative to the speed of sound in the fluid
