liquid water showing droplets and air bubbles caused by the drops


water is a liquid at the temperatures and pressures that are most adequate for life specifically at a standard pressure of 1  water is a liquid between 0   32   and 100c  212f  increasing the pressure slightly lowers the  which is about 5c at 600 atm and 22c at 2100 atm this effect is relevant for example to  to the  and to the movement of   at pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures 
increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the  that is about 374c at 220 atm this effect is important in among other things deep-sea  and   and  design at the top of  where the atmospheric pressure is about 0.34 atm water boils at 68c  154f  at very low pressures  below about 0.006 atm  water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by a phenomenon exploited in the  of food at very high pressures  above 221 atm  the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable a state called  water also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less  as it freezes the maximum density of water in its liquid form  at 1atm  is 1,000kg m3  62.43lb cuft  that occurs at 3.98c  39.16f  the density of ice is 917kg m3  57.25lb cuft  thus water expands 9 in volume as it freezes which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water the details of the exact chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood  some theories suggest that water s unusual behaviour is as a result of it having 2 liquid states taste and odor
pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths and frogs are known to be able to smell it however water from ordinary sources  including bottled mineral water  usually has many dissolved substances that may give it varying tastes and odors  and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the  of water by avoiding water that is too salty or  color and appearance
the apparent color of natural bodies of water  and swimming pools  is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids or by reflection of the sky than by water itself light in the visible  can traverse a couple meters of pure water  or ice  without significant  so that it looks  and colorless thus   and other  organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep because  can reach them water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas through a thickness of 10 meters or more however the intrinsic   or ice  is visibly turquoise  greenish blue  as its  has a sharp minimum at the corresponding color of light  1 227 m1 at 418nm  the color becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness  practically no sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below 1000 meters of depth  infrared and ultraviolet light on the other hand is strongly  by water the  of liquid water  1.333 at 20c  is much higher than that of air  1.0  similar to those of  and  but lower than those of   1.473    1.501    1.627  and common types of glass  1.4 to 1.6  the refraction index of ice  1.31  is lower than that of liquid water polarity and hydrogen bonding

liquid water
liquid water is present on earth covering 71 of its surface liquid water is also occasionally present in small amounts  scientists believe liquid water is present in the saturnian moons of  as a 10-kilometre thick ocean approximately 3040 kilometres below enceladus  south polar surface and  as a subsurface layer possibly mixed with  jupiter s moon  has surface characteristics which suggest a subsurface liquid water ocean liquid water may also exist on jupiter s moon  as a layer sandwiched between high pressure ice and rock water ice
water is present as ice on

an estimate of the share of people in developing countries with access to  19702000


 is politics affected by water and  for this reason water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts it causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity 1.6 billion people have gained access to a safe water source since 1990 the proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30 in 1970 to 71 in 1990 79 in 2000 and 84 in 2004 this trend is projected to continue to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water is one of the  this goal is projected to be reached a 2006 united nations report stated that  there is enough water for everyone  but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption in addition global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery such as the  have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively as they have in education and health potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act the authors of the 2007  cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply  blueprints  that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts the mekong river is one example  a review by the  of policies in six countries that rely on the mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken they also discovered that cambodia s draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be the   wwdr 2003  from the  indicates that in the next 20 years the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30 40 of the world s inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal  more than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from   related to the consumption of contaminated water  or drought in 2004 the uk charity  reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases  often this means lack of  disposal  see toilet organizations concerned with water protection include the   iwa    and the american water resources association the  undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty water related conventions are   unccd    and   takes place on 22 march and  on 8 june in culture

water is considered a purifier in most religions faiths that incorporate ritual washing   include christianity    the    and  immersion  or  or   of a person in water is a central  of christianity  where it is called   it is also a part of the practice of other religions including islam   judaism   and    in addition a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including islam and judaism in islam the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water   unless water is unavailable  see   in shinto water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area  e.g in the ritual of   in christianity  is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of  the  of persons places and objects or as a means of repelling evil philosophy
the ancient greek philosopher  held that water is one of the four  along with fire earth and  and was regarded as the  or basic substance of the universe  who was portrayed by aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer theorized that the earth which is denser than water emerged from the water thales a  believed further that all things are made from water plato believed the shape of water is an  which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth in the theory of the  water was associated with  as being cold and moist the  was also one of the  in traditional  along with    and  water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular asian philosophy james legge s 1891 translation of the dao de jing states  the highest excellence is like  that of  water the excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things and in its occupying without striving  to the contrary  the low place which all men dislike hence  its way  is near to  that of  the tao  and  there is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of itfor there is nothing  so effectual  for which it can be changed   in  shui di   chapter further elaborates on symbolism of water proclaiming that  man is water  and attributing natural qualities of the people of different chinese regions to the character of local water resources see also
