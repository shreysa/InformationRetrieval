a  moved off the coast of africa on july 1 it steadily organized as it moved westward and resembled a tropical depression by july 7 however surface reports and  indicated the system did not have tropical characteristics and remained simply a low-pressure system the wave produced tropical storm-force winds as it moved through the  on july 8 but did not acquire tropical characteristics until it reached the eastern caribbean because it had tropical storm-force winds the system was upgraded immediately to tropical storm claudette after it developed a low-level circulation later on july 8 by early on july 9 while south of  claudette quickly strengthened over the warm waters of the caribbean and its strongest winds were just shy of the threshold for hurricane intensity possibly due to its fast forward motion the storm became disorganized and weakened conditions briefly became more favorable over the western caribbean and claudette reached hurricane status for six hours on july 10 soon after the storm encountered unfavorable upper-level winds and weakened back into a tropical storm in response to a break in the a high-pressure ridge that often prevents tropical systems from moving northwardit turned to the west-northwest claudette made its first  at  on the  on july 11 as a tropical storm with 60mph  97km h  winds 



hurricane claudette making landfall at  on july 15


claudette wobbled to the northwest over the  and gradually restrengthened upper-level winds steadily decreased and claudette again became a hurricane late on july 14 just prior to landfall it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction striking  on july 15 as a category1 hurricane on the  with 90mph  150km h  winds residents along and inland of the central texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival the hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of july 15 but instead came ashore before noon furthermore some initial estimates suggested that claudette had reached category2 status with sustained winds of up to 100mph  155km h  these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data as slow as claudette was to strengthen it was also slow to dissipate over land inland hurricane warnings were issued for several counties away from the coastline and winds gusted to 83mph  134km h  at victoria regional airport it maintained tropical storm intensity for over 24hours after landfall a rarity for such a weak storm  most tropical systems weaken rapidly after landfall as they are separated from the warm waters that power them the storm finally lost its low-level circulation early on july 17 over  although its rainfall and upper-level circulation continued into the pacific ocean preparations 
mexican officials issued a  37hours prior to the storm s landfall between  and   the warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning about a day before landfall but was downgraded when claudette weakened just 13hours prior to its landfall in the yucatn peninsula the mexican government declared a state of emergency in the projected path of the storm and declared an evacuation order for 1,500 citizens in quintana roo there residents remained calm during the evacuation tourists left nightclubs for supermarkets to stock up on among other items  which was banned at midnight schools were set up as shelters while police forced tourists to remain in their hotels the consistent variation in the path of claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall on july 13 two days prior to claudette s eventual landfall the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch between  and port o connor texas by the next day a hurricane warning existed from  to  while a tropical storm warning extended from high island to  when it became apparent that louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm the state s tropical storm warnings were canceled in   officials recommended evacuations for western  and  24hours prior to claudette s projected landfall the emergency phone notification system notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion some of whom remembered the flooding from  five years before hurricane claudette also affected the        and  all limited production and evacuated many of their workers chevron which evacuated more than 1,800workers returned many of its workers on the day when claudette made landfall unocal closed 23rigs and platforms in the region the combined closures stopped the daily production of 225,000 barrels  35,800m3  per day of oil and 2billion cubic feet  57,000,000m3  of natural gas which accounted for 15 of the total production in the gulf of mexico impact
