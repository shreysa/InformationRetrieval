meteorological prediction of ike s path on september 3 2008


ike s gradual strengthening began to quicken early on september3 with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm at roughly 15 00utc that day  indicated that a primordial  was developing within the intensifying tropical storm tracking northwestward the nhc upgraded ike to hurricane status at 18 00utc based on  and the appearance of the eye on  during this time ike was centered 690mi  1,110km  east-northeast of the  and was tracking west-northwestward as a result of a weakened  to its northeast ike s placement in an area with virtually no  allowed for the hurricane to undergo  despite unfavorable upper-level winds to its north reaching  strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane at 06 00utc on september4 ike peaked with  of 145 miles per hour  233 kilometers per hour  and a minimum  of 935   27.6   making the storm a  on the  after peaking in strength a ridge of high pressure to the storm s west strengthened causing ike to track towards the southwesta path unusual for the time of year however this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind shear causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on september4 and weaken briefly dropping below major hurricane status on september6 while 150 miles  240km  east of  although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days after passing near the  ike made its first  on  in the  at 13 00utc on september7 with winds of 125mph  201km h  after passing over inagua the development of a double eyewalla feature that usually denotes the beginning of an slightly weakened ike late on september7 however the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach category4 intensity for a final time before making landfall near cabo lucrecia on the coast of  in  by 00 00utc the next day although ike remained well-defined for most of its crossing of eastern cuba the hurricane s core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the  after spending a few hours over land over the next day ike tracked westward paralleling the southern coast of cuba without much intensification  at times the center of the hurricane was within 12mi  19km  of the island at around 14 00utc on september9 ike made a second cuban landfall this time on punta la capitana in  with winds of 80mph  130km h  roughly six hours later the hurricane emerged into the  as a slightly weakened system despite tracking back over water ike s prolonged interaction with cuba had greatly disrupted the system s core and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing the storm s wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued due to the storm s comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands an eyewall replacement cycle took place preventing ike from rapidly intensifying at around the same time a  strengthened to the hurricane s north steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated moving over the warm waters of the  ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 00 00utc with an estimate of 944mbar  27.9inhg  though winds would continue to strengthen afterward the storm s pressure would rise by late on september12 ike had reached the western edge of the nearby  and began to curve northward the formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds and at 0700utc on september13 ike made landfall on the northeast end of  in  with a minimum barometric pressure of 950mbar  28inhg  and sustained winds of 110mph  180km h  making ike a category2 hurricane after tracking inland ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward weakening to  status east of  late on september13 and later becoming a powerful  on september14 over the  a more steady weakening phase ensued and after tracking across southern  and  the remnants of ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the  on september15 preparations
