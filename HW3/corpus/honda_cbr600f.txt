for the 2001 model year honda released an upgraded version of the popular  with intentions of becoming more competitive in the middleweight sport bike class the 370lb  170kg    f4i is a modified f4 with numerous engine chassis and bodywork changes the 2001 us f4i had a new subframe which raises the seat by five millimeters allows for more storage room and improved two-tier seat the new tail unit has less padding and a higher perch for the passenger the f4i s tail-light is smaller with a new dual-bulb configuration the f4i had a new dash layout with a large analog tachometer the new lcd digital display had a speedometer odometer clock engine temperature read-out amber shift light and trip meters.the single largest change aside from the styling is the addition of high-pressure  50psi  programmed fuel injection  thus the model designation  f4i  in a number of countries the bike was sold in both the  normal  and  sport  variants the sport having a two-part seat no grab rail and no main stand  though the main stand mounting holes remained  fuel injection allows for more precise fuel metering and delivery over a wider rpm range while providing better throttle response and reducing emissions the injectors reside one per cylinder and work with 38mm throttle bodies each injector has four nozzles and together the injectors add up to five horsepower over the f4 weight was also reduced the rear wheel was made lighter and the front wheel the rotor carriers moved out closer to the brake calipers to reduce weight and to improve rigidity but stopping power still was not on par with other bikes in the class there is additional bracing on the steering head for more response better feedback and feel from the front end the suspension has also been tweaked with less high-speed damping and a little more low-speed damping with the shock and fork being more street-bias 
additional engine changes include a lighter camshaft sprocket and increased valve spring pressure  two springs per intake valve  which allow for higher revving there are new piston rings that slide with less friction and increased internal engine oil flow redline is now 14,200rpm 700rpm higher than the previous year s f4 to increase the bike s pulling capabilities at high speeds 5th and 6th gears have been shortened slightly and the rear sprocket was enlarged from 45 teeth to 46.also adding one clutch plate for greater durability to now making 8 the oiling holes in the camshafts have been enlarged by 0.5mm  to 2.5mm  and piston ring friction has been decreased to aid cooling at the higher rev ceiling spring pressures on the intake and exhaust valves have been increased to avoid valve float also there are now two valve springs  inner and outer  on the intake side instead of the single item that resides on the exhaust side the f4i s new bodywork carries a more racy look and provides a 3 reduction in drag it also houses a new dual headlight front cowl design which uses 40 brighter h7 bulbs compared to the old h4 bulbs the headlights are dual multi-reflector units covered by a one-piece flexiglass lens the turn stalks are shorter and the mirrors are now positioned higher and closer to the rider the elimination of carburetors allowed for a slightly larger air box and a larger 4.8usgal  18l  4.0impgal  fuel tank and a fuel consumption of 36.7mpgus  6.41l 100km  44.1mpgimp  in 2001 and 2002 in recognition of honda s association with motogp champion valentino rossi and its 500th motorcycle grand prix victory the cbr600f4i was also released in europe and australia  2002 only  in two  rossi replica  versions
