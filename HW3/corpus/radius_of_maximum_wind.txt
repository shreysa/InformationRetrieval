the radius of maximum wind of a tropical cyclone lies just within the eyewall of an intense tropical cyclone such as  from 2003


the radius of maximum wind  rmw  is the distance between the center of a  and its band of strongest  it is a parameter in atmospheric dynamics and  the highest  rates occur near the rmw of  the extent of a cyclone s  and its maximum potential intensity can be determined using the rmw as  increase the rmw decreases recently rmw has been used in descriptions of  when designing  to prevent against failure from atmospheric pressure change rmw can be used in the calculations

determination 
the rmw is traditionally measured by reconnaissance aircraft in the atlantic basin it can also be determined on  as the distance between the cyclone center and the system s greatest pressure gradient using  data the distance between the coldest cloud top temperature and the warmest temperatature within the  in infrared satellite imagery is one method of determining rmw the reason why this method has merit is that the strongest winds within  tend to be located under the deepest  which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops use of velocity data from doppler  can also be used to determine this quantity both for tornadoes and tropical cyclones near the coast tornadoes 




radar imagery of a tornado and associated mesocyclone in  reflectivity data on the left show the calm interior of the tornado velocity data on the right show where the strongest winds are located

in the case of tornadoes knowledge of the rmw is important as atmospheric pressure change  apc  within sealed buildings can cause failure of the structure most buildings have openings totaling one square foot per 1,000-cubic-foot  28m3  volume to help equalize air pressure between the inside and outside of the structures the apc is around one-half of its maximum value at the rmw which normally ranges between 150 feet  46m  and 500 feet  150m  from the center  or eye  of the tornado the widest tornado as measured by actual radar wind measurements was the  tornado in northern oklahoma part of the  which had a radius of maximum wind of over 800 metres  2,600ft  tropical cyclones

an average value for the rmw of 47 kilometres  29mi  was calculated as the mean  or average  of all hurricanes with a lowest central  between a pressure of 909 hectopascals  26.8inhg  and 993 hectopascals  29.3inhg  as tropical cyclones intensify maximum sustained winds increase as the rmw decreases however values for rmw produced based on central pressure or maximum wind speed could be substantial scattering around the regression lines the heaviest rainfall within intense tropical cyclones has been observed in the vicinity of the rmw the radius of maximum wind helps determine the direct strikes of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones are considered to have made a direct strike to a landmass when a tropical cyclone passes close enough to a landmass that areas inside the radius of maximum wind are experienced on land the radius of maximum wind is used within the maximum potential intensity equation the emanuel equation for maximum intensity potential relies upon the winds near the rmw of a tropical cyclone to determine its ultimate potential the highest storm surge is normally coincident with the radius of maximum wind because the strongest winds within a tropical cyclone lie at the rmw this is the region of a tropical cyclone which generates the dominant waves near the storm and ultimately  away from the cyclone tropical cyclones mix the ocean water within a radius three times that of the rmw which lowers sea surface temperatures due to  much is still unknown about the radius of maximum wind in tropical cyclones including whether or not it can be predictable see also
