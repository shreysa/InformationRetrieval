characteristics 
supercells are usually found isolated from other thunderstorms although they can sometimes be embedded in a  typically supercells are found in the warm sector of a low pressure system propagating generally in a north easterly direction in line with the cold front of the low pressure system because they can last for hours they are known as quasi-steady-state storms supercells have the capability to deviate from the mean wind if they track to the right or left of the mean wind  relative to the vertical   they are said to be  right-movers  or  left-movers  respectively supercells can sometimes develop two separate updrafts with opposing rotations which splits the storm into two supercells  one left-mover and one right-mover supercells can be any size  large or small low or high topped they usually produce copious amounts of  torrential  strong  and substantial  supercells are one of the few types of clouds that typically spawn  within the  although only 30 or fewer do so geography 
supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right weather conditions the first storm to be identified as the supercell type was the  storm over  which was studied by  and frank ludlam in 1962 browning did the initial work that was followed up by  and  to develop the modern conceptual model of the supercell to the extent that records are available supercells are most frequent in the  of the central united states and southern canada extending into the southeastern u.s and northern   east-central argentina and adjacent regions of uruguay  bangladesh and parts of eastern india  south africa  and eastern australia supercells occur occasionally in many other  regions including eastern china and throughout europe the areas with highest frequencies of supercells are similar to those with the most occurrences of tornadoes  see  and  anatomy of a supercell 
the current conceptual model of a supercell was described in severe thunderstorm evolution and mesocyclone structure as related to tornadogenesis by leslie r lemon and charles a doswell iii  see   supercells derive their rotation through tilting of horizontal   an invisible horizontal   caused by  strong updrafts lift the air turning about a horizontal axis and cause this air to turn about a vertical axis this forms the deep rotating updraft the  a cap or  is usually required to form an updraft of sufficient strength the cap puts an inverted  warm-above-cold  layer above a normal  cold-above-warm   and by preventing warm surface air from rising allows one or both of the following 

air below the cap warms and or becomes more moist
air above the cap cools

this creates a warmer moister layer below a cooler layer which is increasingly unstable  because warm air is less dense and tends to rise  when the cap weakens or moves explosive development follows in north america supercells usually show up on doppler radar as starting at a point or hook shape on the southwestern side fanning out to the northeast the heaviest precipitation is usually on the southwest side ending abruptly short of the rain-free updraft base or main updraft  not visible to radar  the  or rfd carries precipitation counterclockwise around the north and northwest side of the updraft base producing a   that indicates the presence of a mesocyclone

this  dome  feature appears above the strongest updraft location on the anvil of the storm it is a result of a very powerful updraft  enough to break through the upper levels of the troposphere an observer who is at ground level too close to the storm is unable to see the overshooting top due to the fact that the anvil blocks the sight of this feature the overshooting is visible from satellite images as a  bubbling  amidst the otherwise smooth upper surface of the anvil cloud anvil 
an anvil forms when the storm s updraft collides with the upper levels of the lowest layer of the atmosphere or the troposphere and has nowhere else to go due to the laws of fluid dynamics specifically pressure humidity and density the anvil is very cold and virtually precipitation free even though virga can be seen falling from the forward sheared anvil since there is so little moisture in the anvil winds can move freely the clouds take on their anvil shape when the rising air reaches 15,20021,300 metres  50,00070,000ft  or more the anvil s distinguishing feature is that it juts out in front of the storm like a shelf in some cases it can even shear backwards called a backsheared anvil another sign of a very strong updraft precipitation-free base 
this area typically on the southern side of the storm in north america is relatively precipitation free this is located beneath the main updraft and is the main area of inflow while no precipitation may be visible to an observer large hail may be falling from this area a region of this area is called the vault it is more accurately called the main updraft area wall cloud 
the  forms near the downdraft updraft interface this  interface  is the area between the precipitation area and the precipitation-free base wall clouds form when rain-cooled air from the downdraft is pulled into the updraft this wet cold air quickly saturates as it is lifted by the updraft forming a cloud that seems to  descend  from the precipitation-free base wall clouds are common and are not exclusive to supercells  only a small percentage actually produce a tornado but if a storm does produce a tornado it usually exhibits wall clouds that persist for more than ten minutes wall clouds that seem to move violently up or down and violent movements of cloud fragments  scud or fractus  near the wall cloud are indications that a tornado could form mammatus clouds 
  mamma mammatocumulus  are bulbous or pillow-like cloud formations extending from beneath the anvil of a thunderstorm these clouds form as cold air in the anvil region of a storm sinks into warmer air beneath it mammatus are most apparent when they are lit from one side or below and are therefore at their most impressive near sunset or shortly after sunrise when the sun is low in the sky mammatus are not exclusive to supercells and can be associated with developed thunderstorms and cumulonimbus forward flank downdraft  ffd 
this is generally the area of heaviest and most widespread precipitation for most supercells the precipitation core is bounded on its leading edge by a  that results from rain-cooled air within the precipitation core spreading outward and interacting with warmer moist air from outside of the cell between the precipitation-free base and the ffd a  vaulted  or  cathedral  feature can be observed in high precipitation supercells an area of heavy precipitation may occur beneath the main updraft area where the vault would alternately be observed with classic supercells rear flank downdraft  rfd 
main article  
the rfd of a supercell is a very complex and not yet fully understood feature rfd mainly occur within classic and hp supercells although rfds have been observed within lp supercells the rfd of a supercell is believed to play a large part in tornadogenesis by further tightening rotation within the surface mesocyclone rfds are caused by mid level steering winds of a supercell colliding with the updraft tower and moving around it in all directions  specifically the flow that is redirected downward is referred to as the rfd this downward surge of relatively cool mid level air due to interactions between dew points humidity and condensation of the converging of air masses can reach very high speeds and is known to cause widespread wind damage the radar signature of an rfd is a hook like structure where sinking air has brought with it precipitation vault 
a vault is not observed with all supercells the vault can only be identified visibly due to it visibly appearing to be free of precipitation but usually containing large hail on doppler radar the region of very high precipitation echos with a very sharp gradient perpendicular to the rfd flanking line

this  is a region of weak echoes found radially behind the main reflectivity core at higher elevations when large hail is present supercell variations 
supercell thunderstorms are sometimes classified by  and  into three categories however not all supercells fit neatly into any one category being hybrid storms and many supercells may fall into different categories during different periods of their lifetimes the standard definition given above is referred to as the classic supercell all types of supercells typically produce severe weather low precipitation  lp 




schematics of an lp supercell






idealized view of an lp supercell


lp supercells contain a small and relatively light precipitation  rain hail  core that is well separated from the updraft the updraft is intense and lps are inflow dominant storms the updraft tower is typically more strongly tilted and the deviant rightward motion lesser than for other supercell types the forward flank downdraft  ffd  is noticeably weaker than for other supercell types and the rear-flank downdraft  rfd  is much weakereven visually absent in many cases like classic supercells lp supercells tend to form within stronger mid-to-upper level storm-relative wind shear however the atmospheric environment leading to their formation is not well understood the moisture profile of the atmosphere particularly the depth of the elevated dry layer also appears to be important and the low-to-mid level shear may also be important this type of supercell may be easily identifiable with  sculpted  cloud striations in the updraft base or even a  corkscrewed  or   appearance on the updraft and sometimes an almost  anorexic  look compared to classic supercells this is because they often form within drier moisture profiles  often initiated by   leaving lps with little available moisture despite high mid-to-upper level environmental winds they most often dissipate rather than turning into classic or hp supercells although it is still not unusual for lps to do the latter especially when moving into a much moister air mass lps were first formally described by  in the early 1980s although storm chasing scientists noticed them throughout the 1970s classic supercells may wither yet maintain updraft rotation as they decay becoming more like the lp type in a process known as  downscale transition  that also applies to lp storms and this process is thought to be how many lps dissipate lp supercells rarely spawn tornadoes and those that form tend to be weak small and high based tornadoes but strong tornadoes have been observed these storms although generating lesser precipitation amounts and producing smaller precipitation cores can generate huge hail lps may produce hail larger than  in clear air where no rainfall is visible lps are thus hazardous to people and animals caught outside as well as to storm chasers and spotters due to the lack of a heavy precipitation core lp supercells often exhibit relatively weak radar reflectivity without clear evidence of a  when in fact they are producing a tornado at the time lp supercells may not even be recognized as supercells in reflectivity data unless one is trained or experienced on their radar characteristics this is where observations by  and  may be of vital importance in addition to  velocity  and polarimetric  radar data high-based shear  sometimes form midway between the base and the top of the storm descending from the main cb   cloud  lightning discharges may be less frequent compared to other supercell types but on occasion lps are prolific sparkers and the discharges are more likely to occur as intracloud lightning rather than cloud-to-ground lightning 
in  these storms most prominently form in the semi-arid  during the spring and summer months moving east and southeast they often collide with moist air masses from the gulf of mexico leading to the formation of hp supercells in areas just to the west of  before dissipating  or coalescing into   at variable distances farther east lp supercells have been observed as far east as  and  however lp supercells can occur as far north as   and even in the prairie provinces of   and  in  they have also been observed by storm chasers in  and   the   
lp supercells are quite sought after by storm chasers because the limited amount of precipitation makes sighting tornadoes at a safe distance much less difficult than with a classic or hp supercell and more so because of the unobscured storm structure unveiled during spring and early summer areas in which lp supercells are readily spotted include southwestern  and northwestern  among other parts of the western  
high precipitation  hp 




schematics of an hp supercell






high precipitation supercell


the hp supercell has a much heavier precipitation core that can wrap all the way around the mesocyclone these are especially dangerous storms since the mesocyclone is wrapped with rain and can hide a tornado  if present  from view these storms also cause flooding due to heavy rain damaging  and weak tornadoes although they are also known to produce strong to violent tornadoes they have a lower potential for damaging hail than classic and lp supercells although damaging hail is possible it has been observed by some spotters that they tend to produce more cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning than the other types also unlike the lp and classic types severe events usually occur at the front  southeast  of the storm the hp supercell is the most common type of supercell in the  east of  in the southern parts of the provinces of  and  in  and in the central portions of argentina and  mini-supercell or low-topped supercell 
whereas  hp and lp refer to different precipitation regimes and mesoscale frontal structures another variation was identified in the early 1990s by jon davies these smaller storms were initially called mini-supercells but are now commonly referred to as low-topped supercells these are also subdivided into classic hp and lp types effects 




satellite view of a supercell


supercells can produce large hail damaging winds deadly  flooding dangerous cloud-to-ground  and heavy rain severe events associated with a supercell almost always occur in the area of the updraft downdraft interface in the  this is most often the rear flank  southwest side  of the precipitation area in lp and classic supercells but sometimes the leading edge  southeast side  of hp supercells while tornadoes are perhaps the most dramatic of these severe events all are dangerous high winds caused by powerful outflow can reach over 148km h  92mph  and  can cause tornado-like damage flooding is the leading cause of death associated with severe weather note that none of these severe events are exclusive to supercells although these events are highly predictable once a supercell has formed examples
