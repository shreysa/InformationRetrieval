iceberg in the arctic with its underside visible 

an iceberg or ice mountain is a large piece of   that has broken off a  or an  and is floating freely in open water it may subsequently become frozen into   one form of   as it drifts into shallower waters it may come into contact with the seabed a process referred to as  also about 91 of an iceberg is below the surface of the

etymology 
the word  iceberg  is a partial  from the  word ijsberg literally meaning ice mountain cognate to  isbjerg  eisberg  iesbarg and  isberg overview

because the  of pure ice is about 920  and that of  about 1025kg m3 typically one-tenth of the volume of an iceberg is above water  due to   the shape of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface this has led to the expression   for a problem or difficulty that is only a small manifestation of a larger problem icebergs generally range from 1 to 75 metres  3.3 to 246.1ft  above sea level and weigh 100,000 to 200,000 metric tons  110,000 to 220,000 short tons  the largest known iceberg in the  was 168 metres  551ft  above sea level reported by the uscg icebreaker east wind in 1958 making it the height of a 55-story building these icebergs originate from the glaciers of western  and may have an interior temperature of 15 to 20c  5 to 4f  icebergs are usually confined by winds and currents to move close to the coast the largest icebergs recorded have been  or broken off from the  of   photographed by satellite in 2000 measured 295 by 37 kilometres  183 by 23mi  with a surface area of 11,000 square kilometres  4,200sqmi  the largest iceberg on record was an antarctic tabular iceberg of over 31,000 square kilometres  12,000sqmi   335 by 97 kilometres  208 by 60mi  sighted 150 miles  240km  west of  in the south pacific ocean by the uss glacier on november 12 1956 this iceberg was larger than  when a piece of iceberg ice melts a fizzing sound called the  bergie   is produced this sound is made when the water-ice interface reaches compressed air bubbles trapped in the ice as this happens each bubble bursts making a  popping  sound the bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice that eventually got buried to a given depth  up to several kilometers  and pressurized as it transformed into  then to glacial ice recent large icebergs

in addition to size classification icebergs can be classified on the basis of their shape the two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular tabular icebergs have steep sides and a flat top much like a  with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5 1 this type of iceberg also known as an ice island can be quite large as in the case of   icebergs formed by breaking off from an  such as the  or  are typically tabular the largest icebergs in the world are formed this way non-tabular icebergs have different shapes and include

monitoring 






acoustic monitoring of an iceberg 

icebergs are monitored worldwide by the u.s   nic  established in 1995 which produces analyses and forecasts of    and  ice conditions more than 95 of the data used in its sea ice analyses are derived from the remote sensors on polar-orbiting satellites that survey these remote regions of the earth

the nic is the only organization that names and tracks all antarctic icebergs it assigns each iceberg larger than 10 nautical miles  19km  along at least one axis a name composed of a letter indicating its point of origin and a running number the letters used are as follows 

a   0 to 90w    
b  longitude 90w to 180   eastern  
c  longitude 90e to 180  western ross sea  
d  longitude 0 to 90e   eastern weddell sea 

 calved from the  in 2000 and initially had an area of 11,000 square kilometres  4,200sqmi  it broke apart in november 2002 the largest remaining piece of it  with an area of 3,000 square kilometres  1,200sqmi  was still the largest iceberg on earth until it ran aground and split into several pieces october 27 2005 an event that was observed by seismographs both on the iceberg and across antarctica it has been hypothesized that this breakup may also have been abetted by ocean swell generated by an  storm 6 days earlier and 13,500 kilometres  8,400mi  away history

in the 20th century several scientific bodies were established to study and monitor the icebergs the  formed in 1914 in response to the april 1912  of the  which killed 1,517 of its 2,223 passengers and crew monitors iceberg dangers near the  of newfoundland and provides the  limits of all known ice  in that vicinity to the maritime community technology history 
before the early 1910s there was no system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions most likely because they weren t considered a serious threat as  ships had managed to survive even direct crashes in 1907  a german liner had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow but was still able to complete her voyage the april 1912 sinking of the  however changed all that and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs for the remainder of the ice season of that year the  patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow in november 1913 the  met in  to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the   iip  the goal of the iip was to collect data on  and  to measure currents ice-flow ocean temperature and salinity levels they published their first records in 1921 which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement new technologies monitor icebergs aerial surveillance of the seas in the early 1930s allowed for the development of charter systems that could accurately detail the ocean currents and iceberg locations in 1945 experiments tested the effectiveness of  in detecting icebergs a decade later oceanographic monitoring outposts were established for the purpose of collecting data  these outposts continue to serve in environmental study a computer was first installed on a ship for the purpose of oceanographic monitoring in 1964 which allowed for a faster evaluation of data by the 1970s  ships were equipped with automatic transmissions of  photographs of ice in  systems for optical satellites had been developed but were still limited by weather conditions in the 1980s drifting  were used in antarctic waters for oceanographic and  they are equipped with sensors that measure ocean temperature and currents
