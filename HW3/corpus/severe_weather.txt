various forms of severe weather







severe weather refers to any dangerous  phenomena with the potential to cause damage serious social disruption or loss of human life types of severe weather phenomena vary depending on the    and  conditions high winds  excessive  and  are forms and effects of severe weather as are      and  regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include    and

terminology 
meteorologists generally define severe weather as any aspect of the weather that poses risks to life property or requires the intervention of authorities a narrower definition of severe weather is any weather phenomena relating to  according to the   wmo  severe weather can be categorized into two groups  general severe weather and localized severe weather  european wind storms and the phenomena that accompany them form over wide geographic areas these occurrences are classified as general severe weather downbursts and tornadoes are more localized and therefore have a more limited geographic effect these forms of weather are classified as localized severe weather the term severe weather is technically not the same phenomenon as  extreme weather describes unusual weather events that are at the extremes of the historical distribution for a given area causes 




this graphic shows the conditions favorable for certain organized thunderstorm complexes based upon  and vertical  values 

organized severe weather occurs from the same conditions that generate ordinary thunderstorms  atmospheric moisture lift  often from   and  a wide variety of conditions cause severe weather several factors can convert thunderstorms into severe weather for example a pool of cold air aloft may aid in the development of large hail from an otherwise innocuous appearing thunderstorm however the most severe hail and tornadoes are produced by  thunderstorms and the worst  and   straight-line winds  are produced by  both of these types of storms tend to form in environments high in  floods hurricanes tornadoes and thunderstorms are considered to be the most destructive weather-related  although these weather phenomena are all related to  they form and develop under different conditions and geographic locations the relationship between these weather events and their formation requirements are used to develop  to predict the most frequent and possible locations this information is used to notify affected areas and save lives categories

severe thunderstorms can be assessed in three different categories these are  approaching severe   severe  and  significantly severe  approaching severe is defined as hail between 12 to 1 inch  13 to 25mm  diameter or winds between 50 and 58 m.p.h  50 knots 8093km h  in the united states such storms will usually warrant a  severe is defined as hail 1 inch  25mm  diameter or larger winds 58 m.p.h  93km h  or stronger or a tornado significant severe is defined as hail 2 inches  51mm  in diameter or larger winds 75 m.p.h  65 knots 120km h  or stronger a  of strength ef2 or stronger the occurrence of  phenomena by heavy  or extreme temperatures 
both severe and significant severe events warrant a  from the united states   excludes flash floods  the  the  or the  if the event occurs in those countries if a tornado is occurring  a tornado has been seen by   or is imminent   has observed  indicating an incipient tornado  the severe thunderstorm warning will be superseded by a  in the united states and canada a severe weather outbreak is typically considered to be when ten or more tornadoes some of which will likely be long-tracked and violent and many large hail or damaging wind reports occur within one or more consecutive days severity is also dependent on the size of the geographic area affected whether it covers hundreds or thousands of square kilometers

panorama of a strong  which can precede the onset of high winds


high winds are known to cause damage depending upon their strength wind speeds as low as 23 knots  43km h  may lead to power outages when tree branches fall and disrupt power lines some species of trees are more vulnerable to winds trees with shallow roots are more prone to uproot and brittle trees such as  sea  and  are more prone to branch damage wind gusts may cause poorly designed  to sway when wind gusts  with the frequency of the swaying bridge the bridge may fail as occurred with the  in 1940 hurricane-force winds caused by individual thunderstorms thunderstorm complexes derechos tornadoes extratropical cyclones or tropical cyclones can destroy mobile homes and structurally damage buildings with foundations winds of this strength due to downslope winds off terrain have been known to shatter windows and sandblast paint from cars once winds exceed 135 knots  250km h  within strong tropical cyclones and tornadoes homes completely collapse and significant damage is done to larger buildings total destruction to man-made structures occurs when winds reach 175 knots  324km h  the  for cyclones and    in europe  for tornados were developed to help estimate wind speed from the damage they cause tornado

main articles   and 
downbursts are created within thunderstorms by significantly rain-cooled air which upon reaching ground level spreads out in all directions and produce strong winds unlike winds in a  winds in a downburst are not rotational but are directed outwards from the point where they strike land or water 



illustration of a microburst the air moves in a downward motion until it hits ground level it then spreads outward in all directions 

 dry downbursts  are associated with  with very little precipitation while wet downbursts are generated by thunderstorms with large amounts of rainfall  are very small downbursts with winds that extend up to 2.5 miles  4km  from their source while  are large-scale  with winds that extend in excess of 2.5 miles  4km  the heat burst is created by vertical currents on the backside of old  and  where rainfall is lacking heat bursts generate significantly higher temperatures due to the lack of rain-cooled air in their formation  are longer usually stronger forms of downburst winds characterized by straight-lined windstorms downbursts create vertical  or  which are dangerous to aviation these  downbursts can produce damaging winds lasting 5 to 30 minutes with wind speeds as high as 168mph  75m s  and cause tornado-like damage on the ground downbursts also occur much more frequently than tornadoes with ten downburst damage reports for every one tornado squall line

formation of numerous waterspouts in the great lakes region 

waterspouts are generally defined as tornadoes or non tornadoes that develop over bodies of water waterspouts are not known for inflicting much damage because they are not commonly exposed to land but they are capable of traveling over land some waterspouts are known to producestrength winds and are capable of producing equivalent damage vegetation weakly constructed buildings and other infrastructure may be destroyed by waterspouts automobiles may be lifted by advancing waterspouts heavy precipitation may be noted developed from the water raised by the wind currents waterspouts do not generally last long over terrestrial environments as the friction produced easily dissipates the winds strong horizontal winds cause waterspouts to dissipate destroying the concentration of the updrafts while not generally as dangerous as  classic  tornadoes waterspouts can overturn boats and they can cause severe damage to larger ships strong extratropical cyclones

a large hailstone with concentric rings


any form of thunderstorm that produces precipitating  is known as a hailstorm hailstorms are generally capable of developing in any geographic area where    are present although they are most frequent in tropical and monsoon regions the updrafts and downdrafts within cumulonimbus clouds cause water molecules to freeze and solidify creating hailstones and other forms of solid precipitation due to their larger density these hailstones become heavy enough to overcome the density of the cloud and fall towards the ground the downdrafts in cumulonimbus clouds can also cause increases in the speed of the falling hailstones the term  hailstorm  is usually used to describe the existence of significant quantities or size of hailstones hailstones can cause serious damage notably to  aircraft skylights glass-roofed structures  and  rarely massive hailstones have been known to cause  or fatal head  hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history one of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 12th century in  britain the largest hailstone in terms of maximum circumference and length ever recorded in the united states fell in 2003 in  usa the hailstone had a diameter of 7inches  18cm  and a circumference of 18.75inches  47.6cm
