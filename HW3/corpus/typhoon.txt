three different tropical cyclones spinning over the western pacific ocean on august 7 2006  maria bopha saomai  the cyclone on the lower right has intensified into a typhoon 

a typhoon is a mature  that develops between  and  in the  this region is referred to as the  and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on  accounting for almost one-third of the world s annual tropical cyclones for organizational purposes the northern pacific ocean is divided into three regions  the eastern  north america to   central  140 to 180w  and western  180 to 100e  the   rsmc  for tropical cyclone forecasts is in  with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest pacific in   the   the  and  while the rsmc names each system the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year only the philippines use their own naming list for systems approaching the country  a typhoon differs from a cyclone or hurricane only on the basis of location a  is a  that occurs in the  and northeastern  a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a  occurs in the south pacific or  within the northwestern pacific there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year like any tropical cyclone there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development  sufficiently warm  atmospheric instability high  in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough  to develop a  a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical  while the majority of storms form between june and november a few storms do occur between december and may  although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time  on average the northwestern pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally like other basins they are steered by the  towards the west or northwest with some systems recurving near and east of  the philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls with  and japan being impacted slightly less some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck china southern china has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives  has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest pacific

nomenclature
the term typhoon is the regional name in the northwest pacific for a severe  or mature   whereas hurricane is the regional term in the northeast pacific and northern atlantic elsewhere this is called a tropical cyclone severe tropical cyclone or severe cyclonic storm the  cites  fn and  tai fung giving rise to several early forms in english the earliest forms   touffon  later  tufan   tuffon  and others  derive from urdu fn with citations as early as 1588 from 1699 appears  tuffoon  later  tiffoon  derived from chinese with spelling influenced by the older urdu-derived forms the modern spelling  typhoon  dates to 1820 preceded by  tay-fun  in 1771 and  ty-foong  all derived from the chinese tai fung the urdu source word  fn  violent storm  cognate to    tfn  comes via persian from    fn  which may derive from the verb tfdan      to roar to blow furiously  or arabic fa to turn round the chinese source is the word tai fung           tifng  cited as a common dialect form of  d  big  and fng  wind  in mandarin the word for the windstorm is   dfng  big wind  and in    daai6 fung1  big wind  the modern  word    taifuu  is also derived from chinese the first character is normally used to mean  pedestal  or  stand  but is actually a simplification of the older   which means  typhoon  thus the word originally meant  typhoon wind  the    tuphn   is not unrelated and has secondarily contaminated the word the persian and chinese terms may have been originated by the greek word in the first place intensity classifications

a tropical depression is the lowest category that the  uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has wind speeds not exceeding 33 knots  38mph  61km h  a tropical depression is upgraded to a tropical storm should its  exceed 34 knots  39mph  63km h  tropical storms also receive official names from rsmc tokyo should the storm intensify further and reach sustained wind speeds of 48 knots  55mph  89km h  then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm once the system s maximum sustained winds reach wind speeds of 64 knots  74mph  119km h  the jma will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoonthe highest category on its scale from 2009 the  started to further divide typhoons into three different classifications  typhoon severe typhoon and super typhoon a typhoon has wind speed of 64-79 knots  73-91mph  118149km h  a severe typhoon has winds of at least 80 knots  92mph  150km h  and a super typhoon has winds of at least 100 knots  120mph  190km h  the     jtwc  unofficially classifies typhoons with wind speeds of at least 130knots  67m s  150mph  241km h the equivalent of a strong category4 storm in the as super typhoons however the maximum sustained wind speed measurements that the jtwc uses are based on a 1-minute averaging period akin to the u.s   and  as a result the jtwc s wind reports are higher than jma s measurements as the latter are based on a 10-minute averaging interval genesis

there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis  sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high  in the lower to middle levels of the  enough  to develop a low pressure center a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation  that a tropical cyclone will form normally an ocean temperature of 26.5c  79.7f  spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres  160ft  is considered the minimum to maintain the special  that is the tropical cyclone  these warm waters are needed to maintain the  that fuels tropical systems a minimum distance of 500km  300mi  from the  is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis whether it be a depression in the   itcz  or  a broad  or an  a low level feature with sufficient  and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis about 85 to 90percent of pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low vertical wind shear of less than 10m s  20kn 33ft s  between the ocean surface and the  is required for tropical cyclone development typically with pacific typhoons there are two    one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the  and a second towards the equator in general westerly wind increases associated with the  lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all  as the oscillation propagates from west to east it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere s summer season on average twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western pacific ocean near the  and the  along the same meridian or line of longitude there is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main reason for this appears to be the phase of the maddenjulian oscillation or mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time frequency 

nearly one-third of the world s tropical cyclones form within the western pacific this makes this basin the most active on earth pacific typhoons have formed year round with peak months from august to october the peak months correspond to that of the  along with a high storm frequency this basin also features the most globally  on record one of the most recent busy seasons was  tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest pacific ocean and concentrate around june and november in the northern indian ocean the area just northeast of the philippines is the most active place on earth for tropical cyclones to exist across the philippines themselves activity reaches a minimum in february before increasing steadily through june and spiking from july through october with september being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the  activity falls off significantly in november although  the strongest philippine typhoon on record was a november typhoon the most frequently impacted areas of the philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central  and eastern  a ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30percent of the annual rainfall in the northern philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones while the southern islands receive less than 10percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones the genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency paths

tracks of all tropical cyclones in the northernwestern  between 1980 and 2005 the vertical line to the right is the

straight track  or straight runner  a general westward path affects the  southern china  and  a parabolic recurving track storms recurving affect eastern philippines eastern china taiwan korea japan and the russian far east northward track from point of origin the storm follows a northerly direction only affecting small islands 
a rare few storms like  were redesignated as typhoons as they originated in the eastern central pacific and moved into the western pacific basin monitoring 
within the western pacific  part of the  has had the official warning responsibility for the whole of the western pacific since 1989 and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000 however each  within the western pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country such as the joint typhoon warning center for united states agencies the   pagasa  for interests in the island archipelago nation and the  for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of  name sources 
the list of names consists of entries from 17 southeast and east asian nations and the united states who have territories directly affected by typhoons the submitted names are arranged into five lists and each list is cycled with each year unlike tropical cyclones in other parts of the world typhoons are not named after people instead they generally refer to animals flowers astrological signs and a few personal names however pagasa retains its own naming list which does consist of human names therefore a typhoon can possibly have two names storms that cross the date line from the central pacific retain their original name but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon in japan people use the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year records 

the most active western pacific typhoon season was in 1964  when 39storms of tropical storm strength formed only 15 seasons had 30 or more storms developing since reliable records began the least activity seen in the northwest pacific ocean was during the  when only 14tropical storms and seven typhoons formed in the philippines the most active season since 1945 for tropical cyclone strikes was  when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country there was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the philippines in  the  was the busiest for okinawa since 1957 within  in southern china during the past thousand years the most active decades for typhoon strikes were the 1660s and 1670s the highest reliably-estimated  on record for a typhoon were those of  at 195 miles per hour  314km h  shortly before its landfall in the central  on nov 8 2013 the most intense storm based on minimum pressure was  in the northwestern pacific ocean in 1979 which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals  26inhg  and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165knots  85m s 190mph 310km h  the deadliest typhoon of the 20th century was  which killed nearly 100,000 in china in 1975 due to a flood that caused 12 reservoirs to fail after  landed in taiwan at midnight on august 8 2009 almost the entire southern region of taiwan      now merged as tainan     now merged as kaohsiung  and   and parts of  and  were flooded by record-breaking heavy rain the rainfall in  reached 2,327 millimeters  91.6in  breaking all rainfall records of any single place in taiwan induced by a single typhoon and making the cyclone the wettest known typhoon see also
