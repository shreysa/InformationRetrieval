on august 23 the storm began a weakening trend and it turned towards the north the next day the stormhaving weakened to category 1 statusskirted the southeastern tip of  debbie began to lose its tropical characteristics as it accelerated towards the northeast and it weakened into a tropical storm early on august 25 as it moved over increasingly cold waters it dissipated east of  impact and project stormfury

debbie was subject to an experiment called  which attempted to weaken tropical cyclones by  them with  the storm provided an excellent opportunity to test the underpinnings of project stormfury in many ways it was the perfect storm for seeding  it did not threaten any land  it passed within range of seeding aircraft  and was intense with a distinct eye on august 18 and again on august 20 thirteen planes flew out to the storm to monitor and seed it on the first day windspeeds fell by 31 on the second day windspeeds fell by 18 both changes were consistent with stormfury s working hypothesis the results were so encouraging that  a greatly expanded research program was planned  among other conclusions was the need for frequent seeding at close to hourly intervals debbie remained predominately at sea throughout its 3,000mi  4,800km  path and as a result it caused little damage the storm had little or no impact on the island of bermuda as it passed to the south later winds of 50 to 65mph  80 to 105km h  were recorded over eastern newfoundland see also
