toward the end of september 2001 a poorly defined  moved westward across the tropical atlantic ocean through an area of hostile  which was caused by a large  within a  to the northeast of the  a few days later the upper-level low detached from the trough and moved southwestward over the caribbean sea allowing for an upper-level  or high-pressure area to form over the tropical wave the change provided a favorable environment for  and an area of  soon blossomed along the wave s axis as the tropical wave approached the lesser antilles a mid-level  formed within the deepest part of the convection and a low-level circulation became gradually more pronounced on satellite imagery although its low-level circulation was small and poorly defined the system increased in organization enough to be classified as tropical depression eleven at 12 00 on october4 located about 100mi  160km  southeast of  operationally however  did not confirm the depression s formation until nine hours later in its early stages the depression moved west-northwestward between the islands of  and  under the influence of a strong ridge to its north compared to its appearance 24hours before forming the depression exhibited improved  and more distinct convection although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight into the system which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression s well-organized appearance on satellite imagery at 21 00utc on october5 they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74mph  119km h  corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60mph  95km h  based on these data the depression was upgraded to tropical storm iris situated about 155mi  250km  south of the southern coast of puerto rico in post-season analysis the   nhc  estimated that iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier

despite the storm s intensification and well-organized satellite appearance the circulation failed to become better defined in their first discussion on iris the nhc mentioned the potential for the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed one forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south although its overall appearance did not change significantly the hurricane hunters reported a closed  with a diameter 23mi  37km  and a   eyewall curvature  on october6 later that day iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the  and the nhc remarked that land interaction with the greater antilles was the only factor impeding further development after iris reached winds of 85mph  140km h  early on october7 its intensity remained steady for about 24hours during that time the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted possibly due to an  by late on october7 the area of hurricaneforce winds associated with iris extended only 25mi  35km  from its 16mi  22km  wide eye early on october8 after turning west-southwestward away from the greater antilles iris began strengthening again with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear the nhc predicted peak winds of 105mph  165km h  before the storm would hit belize it  with the favorable conditions intensifying from 95mph  150km h  to 140mph  225km h  in a 12-hour period on october8 making iris a  on the   in the same duration the  dropped 38  1.12  while intensifying the hurricane developed  with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7mi  11km  for comparison the smallest known eye diameter on record for an atlantic hurricane was about 3mi  5km  during  in 2005 with such a small eye a hurricane hunters flight could not deploy a  into the center of iris and shortly after the flight the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the honduras coastline just offshore this resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an  but within a few hours iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145mph  230km h  just off belize at 02 00utc on october9 it made  at peak intensity in  in the southern portion of belize initially hurricane iris was forecast to remain a tropical cyclone while crossing  and to re-intensify in the eastern pacific ocean  had it done so it would have retained the name iris instead the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of guatemala and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm late on october9 within sixteen hours of landfall the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern mexico as the remnants approached the pacific ocean a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of iris it gradually organized while continuing westward developing into   the new storm ultimately lasted until october18 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear preparations 
over a stretch of four days sixteen  were issued in association with iris affecting the dominican republic the  provinces of  and  jamaica  the    and  the threat from iris prompted the jamaica national emergency operations center to be activated shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused in belize a hurricane warning was issued about 23hours before iris moved ashore a state of national emergency was declared on october8 as hurricane iris neared landfall all emergency response committees were activated to quickly begin recovery efforts a mandatory evacuation was issued for stann creek and toledo coastal villages and all offshore islands the main hospital in belize city was evacuated as a precaution and the city itself was placed under a voluntary evacuation order overall 11,380people evacuated their homes in belize including many in  these evacuations were later credited for limiting the death toll  had struck the nation a year prior preparing some citizens for what to expect disaster response teams arrived the day after iris was projected to make landfall pan american health organization staff were on standby in belize guatemala and honduras and were ready to respond to any post-storm disease outbreaks on october8 the government of honduras declared a red alert for all northern regions advising residents to expect  extreme weather conditions  about 5,000people in the country evacuated from their homes to the north of belize officials in mexico evacuated people from fishing villages and closed ports impact
while iris was in its development stages residents as far north as  reported rain and thunderstorms in the dominican republic iris dropped around 3in  76mm  of rainfall along the coast forcing 35families to evacuate their homes after rivers exceeded their banks the rains triggered a landslide outside of  that destroyed a home killing a family of three there was another landslide in the region that injured two people iris s passage near jamaica destroyed two houses and damaged the roofs of two others causing one injury otherwise damage in the country was minimal offshore 
a 120ft  37m   boat overturned during the hurricane near  possibly hit by a tornado the boat named the wave dancer had 28people on board including 20 from the richmond dive club out of   most of them were upstairs in the boat and none were diving the captain had delayed returning to shore and the passengers waited for the storm to pass along a dock not anticipating the ferocity iris cut the ropes connecting the boat to the dock causing it to overturn in 12ft  3.7m  waters eight people survived and 11bodies were recovered  it was presumed that 20people died during the wreck including 15 from the richmond area and three crew members another boat the vendera also reportedly capsized with people on board belize 

hurricane iris moved ashore in belize with winds of 145mph  233km h  although the highest measured winds were 106mph  171km h  at a station in big creek because of its small diameter iris produced heavy damage only in a 70mi  110km  area of southern belize in that region the hurricane produced a  of up to 15ft  4.6m  with waves of over 13ft  4.0m  in height causing street flooding and some damage to the offshore cayes as it moved ashore iris damaged houses and schools in dozens of villages in 35villages the storm destroyed more than 95 of the buildings its small size confined the worst damage largely to  and   which are the two southernmost and poorest districts of the country the percentage of damaged houses was 72 in toledo district and about 50 in stann creek leaving about 15,000people homeless in both districts the storm caused power outages and contaminated water supplies in the worst-affected areas poor mayan people living on farms lost much of what they owned at  near the coast about 80 of the homes were destroyed and many of the remaining buildings had roof damage with downed power poles in the streets about 90 of the houses in nearby seine bight were destroyed and where iris made landfall over 90 of the homes were destroyed throughout monkey river town the storm damaged several roads and fishing piers in southern belize iris also damaged tourism facilities including minor impact to the  and damaged 20 of the hotel rooms in the country accounting for  37million in losses the remainder of the country remained generally unaffected during the storm in southern belize the storm s strong winds left crop damage in some cases where the harvest had just begun about 5,000 acres  2,000ha  of bananas were destroyed along with over 3,500 acres  1,400ha  of rice 3,000 acres  1,200ha  of corn and other crops to a lesser degree the storm also flooded fields and killed several livestock the shrimp industry lost 25 of its catch partly due to contaminated waters crop damage in belize was estimated at  103million mostly from banana losses iris s strong winds also damaged large swaths of forest with upwards of 40 of trees affected in some areas this disrupted the habitats of several animals and it is likely that many of the  near monkey river were killed the storm s strong waves eroded the beach although marine effects were much less than those of hurricane keith in the previous year nevertheless there were reports of  after the storm possibly from low oxygen due to too much decaying matter nationwide iris damaged or destroyed 3,718homes directly affecting a total of 21,568people or 8.5 of the total population the storm damaged or destroyed 31schools and 17health facilities along with 21government buildings there was about  25million in damage to the transportation sector including highways and bridges iris killed 24people in and around the country including the victims of the wave dancer shipwreck overall damage was estimated at  250million making it the most damaging storm in the country since  in 1961 elsewhere in central america 
high tides and heavy rainfall caused power outages across both guatemala and honduras in the former the hurricane s rainfall generally amounted to 3 to 4in  76 to 102mm  triggering flash flooding and landslides that injured nearly 100people the damage was heaviest in  in the northern portion of the country the storm damaged 26schools and 2,500homes in the country s interior an estimated 27,500people were affected by the storm throughout guatemala there were eight deaths in the country two of them the result of falling trees the remnants of iris dropped heavy rainfall over southern mexico accumulating 4.80in  122mm  in the southern state of  in  the storm produced heavy rains and damaged a total of 120houses a mudslide in one village demolished 20homes and killed a child while elsewhere in the state a man drowned after being swept away in a flooded river aftermath 
on october9 the government of belize issued the  all clear  signal indicating that the storm had fully passed and began reconstruction efforts and damage assessment the government declared stann creek and toledo districts as disaster areas and officials declared a nighttime curfew by the day after the storm struck the airport in belize city had been reopened and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water forcing them to drink unclean water officials sent medical teams to southern belize in the most affected areas the  red cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money clothing and food for storm victims the red cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000people by october19 most roads in southern belize were reopened the belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs and officials authorized spending  1.2million to rebuild damaged homes to assist the farmers who lost crops the belize government provided 18,000lb  8,200kg  of maize seeds as well as fertilizer after the storm the world food programme and the belize red cross collectively provided food for the 9,000families in need of subsidence by october31 the red cross had provided blankets tarps and hygienic supplies to 4,800people severely affected by the storm homes were gradually repaired and crop production returned to normal by early 2002 around christmas of 2001 the belize red cross provided presents to school children in 14villages affected by the storm the lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22 in 2002 although sales gradually recovered the government of belize issued an appeal to the international community for assistance in the days following iris s landfall and various countries provided aid the united kingdom sent a helicopter to assist in damage assessment and a crew to clean the water the united states also sent a crew for damage assessment and donated plastic sheeting although sustaining significant damage the government of guatemala deployed a working team with members from throughout the country to assist in recovery in belize mexico sent blankets mattresses food and water as well as a medical team the japanese government sent tents and blankets and the chinese government donated 500lb  230kg  of rice and dried fruits various united nations departments donated about  225,000 the american victims of the wave dancer boat wreck were flown back to the richmond virginia area following the storm the insurance company covering the boat reached a  4million settlement which was disbursed among the survivors and the victims  families the boat operator remained in business following the accident following the major damage in belize the name iris was retired in the spring of 2002 by the  and will never again be used for an  the name was subsequently replaced by the name ingrid and was first used during the  see also
