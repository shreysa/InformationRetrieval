dropsonde delivery system on a noaa p-3 hurricane hunter 

a dropsonde is an expendable  reconnaissance device created by the   ncar  designed to be dropped from an  at altitude over water to measure  and therefore track  storm conditions as the device falls to the surface the sonde contains a  receiver along with   and   pth   to capture  profiles and   it typically relays these data to a computer in the aircraft by radio transmission

since the early 1970s  have employed dropsondes while flying over the ocean to obtain meteorological data on the structure of  deemed to be of possible concern to land locations in the northern atlantic and northeastern pacific oceans dropsonde instruments are typically the only way to measurement the wind and pressure near the sea surface within the core of such cyclones allowing meteorologists to reliably establish the storm s intensity and size the data obtained is typically fed into supercomputers for  enabling forecasters to better track and predict what will happen to the hurricane during a typical hurricane season the  hurricane hunters deploys 1000 to 1500 sondes on training and storm missions aircraft reconnaissance missions are also sometimes requested to investigate the broader atmospheric structure over the ocean when cyclones may pose a significant threat to the united states these interests include not only potential hurricanes but also possible snow events  like   or significant  the dropsondes are used to supplement the large gaps over oceans within the global network of  typically satellite data provides an estimate of conditions in such areas but the increased precision of sondes can improve forecasts particularly of the storm path dropsondes may also be employed during meteorological research projects device and launch details 
the sonde is a lightweight system designed to be operated by one person and is launched through a chute installed in the measuring aircraft the device s descent is slowed and stabilized by a small square-cone  allowing for more readings to be taken before it reaches the ocean surface the parachute is designed to immediately deploy after release so as to reduce or eliminate any  effect and the device typically drops for three to five minutes the sonde has a casing of stiff cardboard to protect electronics and form a more stable aerodynamic profile to obtain data in a tropical cyclone an aircraft  in the us operated either by by  or the   flies into the system a series of dropsondes are typically released as the plane passes through the storm typically launched with greatest frequency near the center of the storm including into the  and  eye  center  if one exists most drops are performed at a flight level of around 10,000 feet  approx 3,000 meters  the dropsonde sends back coded data which includes 

the date and time of the drop time is always in  location of the drop indicated by the   and  the height temperature   and  recorded at any standard isobaric surfaces encountered as the dropsonde descends which are from the set of  1000 925 850 700 500 400 300 250   hpa  and at the sea surface the temperature and dewpoint depression at all other atmospheric pressure deemed significant due to important changes or values in the atmospheric conditions found

dropsonde  source  


a driftsonde is a high altitude durable  holding a transmitter and a bank  35 in the first models  of miniature dropsonde capsules which can then be dropped at automatic intervals or remotely the water-bottle-sized transmitters in the dropsondes have enough power to send information to the balloon during their parachute-controlled fall the balloon carries a larger transmitter powerful enough to relay readings to a satellite the single-use sensor packages cost us 300 to  400 each after being introduced in april 2007 around a thousand a year are expected to be used to track winds in hurricane breeding grounds off of west africa which are outside the operating region of hurricane hunter planes see also
