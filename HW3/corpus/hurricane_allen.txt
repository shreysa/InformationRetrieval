allen was an early  which originated from a  that previously moved off the  coastline on july 30 the system  as it moved westward becoming a tropical depression on august 1 however the  did not initiate advisories on allen until almost 24 hours later when it was centered 1,300mi  2,100km  east of the  early on august 2 as the depression moved towards the caribbean it had intensified and became the first named storm of the season the national hurricane center noted that conditions appeared favorable for further intensification however it was also noted that a large cold-low north of  was producing strong westerly wind shear which would cause allen to possibly encounter unfavorable conditions within 72 hours although slower forward movement was anticipated allen remained at generally the same westward pace between 17 and 23mph  27 and 37km h  by august 3 the national hurricane center retracted predictions of less favorable conditions from the cold-low north of puerto rico since that weather system was weakening and moving westward 


at 1600 utc on august 3 the national hurricane center upgraded allen to hurricane status as an air force plane recorded winds of 100mph  155km h  however in post-analysis it was discovered that allen had been a hurricane since 0000 utc on august 3 shortly after the upgrade allen began a period of rapid deepening and intensified into a major hurricane at 0000 utc august 4 while roughly 38mi  61km  northwest of   six hours later allen passed only 8mi  13km  south of  at 0600 utc although the national hurricane center noted that conditions favored slow strengthening allen continued to rapidly intensify and became a category 4 hurricane only two hours after that advisory later on august 4 the national hurricane center noted a barometric pressure of 946  946  27.9  and that it would not drop significantly within 24 hours shortly before 0000 utc on august 5 the minimum pressure decreased to 924mbar  924hpa  27.3inhg  which was noted as equivalent to  in the  by august 5 allen intensified into a category5 hurricane while south of  this made allen the earliest category 5 hurricane in the atlantic on record but was later surpassed by  which reached that intensity on july 16 2005 during this time allen attained a central pressure of 911mbar  911hpa  26.9inhg  the lowest pressure on record in the eastern caribbean sea hence the  dropped by 35mbar  35hpa  1.0inhg  less than 10 hours after the national hurricane center stated that the pressure would not decrease significantly within the time of 24 hours the  passed between  and  as a category4 hurricane after friction with the mountains of haiti and jamaica had caused it to weaken allen intensified back to a category5 hurricane retaining this intensity for over a day it then moved past the islands of  and  causing moderate damage on cayman brac with winds near 135mph the storm then moved between  and the  reaching its peak intensity of 190mph  310km h  and a minimum  of 899mbar  899hpa  26.5inhg  while crossing the  during allen s trek through the  and the  its center of circulation never crossed over land despite its close passage to various islands in and around the caribbean sea allen again weakened to a category4 storm due to friction with mexico and an  but restrengthened into a category5 hurricane for a third time as it moved over the open waters of the gulf of mexico keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to 909mbar  909hpa  26.8inhg  the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western gulf of mexico shortly before  a dry air mass in the western gulf of mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially allen made landfall north of  as a category3 storm with  of 115mph  185km h  it became  on august 11 preparations

when allen reached category5 intensity on august 5 it became the earliest category5 storm ever recorded this record stood until  surpassed it on july 16 2005 allen is one of three atlantic hurricanes to reach category5 on the  on three separate occasions the others being  and  allen also produced the fifth-lowest minimum pressure ever recorded in the atlantic basin at 899    and was the strongest known hurricane in the basin in terms of pressure since 1935 until then it was the second strongest hurricane by pressure in the atlantic basin but was since pushed down to fifth and no hurricane has achieved 190 miles per hour  310km h  winds in this basin since then it remains the most intense storm ever in august allen spent nearly 3days as a category5 storm initially the longest stretch of any previous atlantic hurricane on record however a reanalysis of the  showed that it spent 3 hours longer at category5 intensity than allen and  in 2017 also spent slightly more time as a category5 hurricane than allen five typhoons have spent longer as category 5 storms including most recently  and  in the early 1960s see also
