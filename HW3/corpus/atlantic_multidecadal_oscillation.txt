the atlantic multidecadal oscillation  amo  is a  that affects the   sst  of the  based on different  on multidecadal timescales while there is some support for this mode in models and in historical observations controversy exists with regard to its  and in particular the attribution of sea surface temperature change to natural or  causes especially in tropical atlantic areas important for hurricane development the atlantic multidecadal oscillation is also connected with shifts in hurricane activity rainfall patterns and intensity and changes in fish populations

definition 
the atlantic multidecadal oscillation  amo  was identified by schlesinger and ramankutty in 1994 the amo signal is usually defined from the patterns of sst variability in the north atlantic once any linear trend has been removed this detrending is intended to remove the influence ofinduced  from the analysis however if the global warming signal is significantly non-linear in time  i.e not just a smooth linear increase  variations in the forced signal will leak into the amo definition consequently correlations with the amo index may mask effects of  amo index 
several methods have been proposed to remove the global trend and  influence over the north atlantic   and shea assuming that the effect of global forcing over the north atlantic is similar to the global ocean subtracted the global  60n-60s  mean sst from the north atlantic sst to derive a revised amo index ting et al however argue that the forced sst pattern is not globally uniform  they separated the forced and internally generated variability using signal to noise maximizing  analysis van oldenborgh et al derived an amo index as the sst averaged over the extra-tropical north atlantic  to remove the influence of enso that is greater at tropical latitude  minus the regression on global mean temperature guan and nigam removed the non stationary global trend and pacific natural variability before applying an  analysis to the residual north atlantic sst the linearly detrended index suggests that the north atlantic sst anomaly at the end of the twentieth century is equally divided between the externally forced component and internally generated variability and that the current peak is similar to middle twentieth century  by contrast the others methodology suggest that a large portion of the north atlantic anomaly at the end of the twentieth century is externally forced frajka-williams et al 2017 pointed out that recent changes in cooling of the  warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics increased the spatial distribution of meridional gradient in sea surface temperatures which is not captured by the amo index mechanisms

based on the about 150-year instrumental record a quasi-periodicity of about 70 years with a few distinct warmer phases between ca 19301965 and after 1995 and cool between 19001930 and 19651995 has been identified in models amo-like variability is associated with small changes in the  branch of the  however historical oceanic observations are not sufficient to associate the derived amo index to present-day circulation anomalies  models and observations indicate that changes in atmospheric circulation which induce changes in clouds atmospheric dust and surface heat flux are largely responsible for the tropical portion of the amo the atlantic multidecadal oscillation  amo  is important for how external forcings are linked with north atlantic ssts climate impacts worldwide 
the amo is correlated to air temperatures and rainfall over much of the northern hemisphere in particular in the summer climate in north america and europe through changes in atmospheric circulation the amo can also modulate spring snowfall over the alps  and glaciers  mass variability rainfall patterns are affected in north eastern brazilian and african sahel it is also associated with changes in the frequency of north american  and is reflected in the frequency of severe atlantic  activity recent research suggests that the amo is related to the past occurrence of major droughts in the us midwest and the southwest when the amo is in its warm phase these droughts tend to be more frequent or prolonged two of the most severe droughts of the 20th century occurred during the positive amo between 1925 and 1965  the  of the 1930s and the 1950s drought florida and the pacific northwest tend to be the oppositewarm amo more rainfall 
 suggest that a warm phase of the amo strengthens the summer rainfall over  and  and the  activity  studies have confirmed this patternincreased rainfall in amo warmphase decreased in cold phasefor the sahel over the past 3,000 years relation to atlantic hurricanes

a 2008 study correlated the atlantic multidecadal mode  amm  with  data  18512007  and noted a positive linear trend for minor hurricanes  category 1 and 2  but removed when the authors adjusted their model for undercounted storms and stated  if there is an increase in hurricane activity connected to a greenhouse gas induced global warming it is currently obscured by the 60 year quasi-periodic cycle  with full consideration of meteorological science the number of tropical storms that can mature into severe hurricanes is much greater during warm phases of the amo than during cool phases at least twice as many  the amo is reflected in the frequency of severe atlantic hurricanes  based on the typical duration of negative and positive phases of the amo the current warm regime is expected to persist at least until 2015 and possibly as late as 2035 enfield et al assume a peak around 2020 since 1995 there have been nine atlantic hurricane seasons considered  extremely active  by           and  there are only about 130150 years of data based on instrument data which are too few samples for conventional statistical approaches with the aid of multi-century proxy reconstruction a longer period of 424 years was used by enfield and cidserrano as an illustration of an approach as described in their paper called  the probabilistic projection of climate risk  their histogram of zero crossing intervals from a set of five re-sampled and smoothed version of gray et al  2004  index together with the  gamma distribution fit to the histogram showed that the largest frequency of regime interval was around 1020 year the cumulative probability for all intervals 20 years or less was about 70 there is no demonstrated predictability for when the amo will switch in any deterministic sense computer models such as those that predict  are far from being able to do this enfield and colleagues have calculated the probability that a change in the amo will occur within a given future time frame assuming that historical variability persists  of this kind may prove to be useful for long-term planning in climate sensitive applications such as water management assuming that the amo continues with a quasi-cycle of roughly 70 years the peak of the current warm phase would be expected in c 2020 or based on a 5090 year quasi-cycle between 2000 and 2040  after peaks in c 1880 and c 1950  a 2017 study predicts a continued cooling shift beginning 2014 and the authors note unlike the last cold period in the atlantic the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies in the atlantic is not uniformly cool but instead has anomalously cold temperatures in the  warm temperatures in the  and cool anomalies over the  the tripole pattern of anomalies has increased the subpolar to subtropical meridional gradient in ssts which are not represented by the amo index value but which may lead to increased atmospheric baroclinicity and storminess
