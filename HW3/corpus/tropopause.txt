definition 




schematic showing the different layers of the atmosphere  not to scale  the tropopause is located between the troposphere and the stratosphere 





the tropopause lies higher in the tropics than at the poles 

going upward from the surface it is the point where air ceases to cool with height and becomes almost completely dry more formally the tropopause is the region of the atmosphere where the  changes from positive as it behaves in the troposphere to the stratospheric negative one following is the exact definition used by the  

the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere where an abrupt change in lapse rate usually occurs it is defined as the lowest level at which the lapse rate decreases to 2 c km or less provided that the average lapse rate between this level and all higher levels within 2 km does not exceed 2 c km 
the tropopause as defined above renders as a  surface that is temperature as a function of height varies continuously through the atmosphere but the temperature gradient does not location 
the troposphere is one of the lowest layers of the earth s atmosphere  it is located right above the  and is the layer in which most  phenomena take place the troposphere extends upwards from right above the  and ranges in height from an average of 9km  5.6mi  30,000ft  at the poles to 17km  11mi  56,000ft  at the  in the absence of  and not considering  the  for this layer is 6.5c per kilometer on average according to the u.s standard atmosphere a measurement of both the tropospheric and the stratospheric lapse rates helps identifying the location of the tropopause since temperature increases with height in the stratosphere and hence the lapse rate becomes negative the tropopause location coincides with the lowest point at which the lapse rate falls below a prescribed threshold since the tropopause responds to the average temperature of the entire layer that lies underneath it it is at its peak levels over the equator and reaches minimum heights over the poles on account of this the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17km over the equator due to the variation in starting height the tropopause extremes are referred to as the equatorial tropopause and the polar tropopause given that the lapse rate is not a conservative quantity when the tropopause is considered for stratosphere-troposphere exchanges studies there exists an alternative definition named dynamic tropopause it is formed with the aid of  which is defined as the product of the   i.e the density that arises from using  as the vertical coordinate and the  given that this quantity attains quite different values for the troposphere and the stratosphere instead of using the vertical temperature gradient as the defining variable the dynamic tropopause surface is expressed in   pvu  given that the absolute vorticity is positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the  the threshold value should be taken as positive north of the equator and negative south of it theoretically to define a global tropopause in this way the two surfaces arising from the positive and negative thresholds need to be matched near the equator using another type of surface such as a constant  surface nevertheless the dynamic tropopause is useless at equatorial latitudes because the isentropes are almost vertical for the extratropical tropopause in the  the wmo established a value of 1.5 pvu but greater values ranging between 2 and 3.5 pvu have been traditionally used it is also possible to define the tropopause in terms of chemical composition for example the lower stratosphere has much higher  concentrations than the upper troposphere but much lower  concentrations so appropriate cutoffs can be used phenomena 
the tropopause is not a  hard  boundary vigorous  for example particularly those of tropical origin will   the lower stratosphere and undergo a brief  hour-order or less  low-frequency vertical  such oscillation sets up a low-frequency atmospheric  capable of affecting both atmospheric and oceanic currents in the region 
most commercial aircraft are flown in the lower stratosphere just above the tropopause where clouds are usually absent as also are significant weather perturbations see also
