the atlantic ocean consists of four major upper  with distinct temperature and salinity the atlantic subarctic upper water in the northern-most north atlantic is the source for subarctic intermediate water and north atlantic intermediate water north atlantic central water can be divided into the eastern and western north atlantic central water since the western part is strongly affected by the gulf stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water the eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to mediterranean water north atlantic central water flows into south atlantic central water at  there are five intermediate waters  four low-salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high-salinity formed through evaporation arctic intermediate water flows from north to become the source for north atlantic deep water south of the greenland-scotland sill these two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins the wide range of salinities in the north atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources  labrador sea norwegian-greenland sea mediterranean and south atlantic intermediate water the   nadw  is a complex of four water masses two that form by deep convection in the open ocean classical and upper labrador sea water and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the greenland-iceland-scotland sill denmark strait and iceland-scotland overflow water along its path across earth the composition of the nadw is affected by other water masses especially  and mediterranean overflow water the nadw is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern north atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in europe changes in the formation of nadw have been linked to global climate changes in the past since man-made substances were introduced into the environment the path of the nadw can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from  in the 1960s and

approximate extent of the sargasso sea


the sargasso sea in the western north atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of   s fluitans and natans  float an area 4,000km  2,500mi  wide and encircled by the   and  this population of seaweed probably originated from tertiary ancestors on the european shores of the former  and has if so maintained itself by  floating in the ocean for millions of years

other species endemic to the sargasso sea include the  a predator with algae-like appendages who hovers motionless among the sargassum fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former tethys ocean in what is now the  region that were similar to the sargasso sea it is possible that the population in the sargasso sea migrated to the atlantic as the tethys closed at the end of the miocene around 17ma the origin of the sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries the fossils found in the carpathians in the mid-20th century often called the  quasi-sargasso assemblage  finally showed that this assemblage originated in the  from were it migrated over  to the central atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the sargasso sea the location of the spawning ground for european eels  in the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern sargasso sea is the spawning ground for both the  and  and that the former migrate more than 5,000km  3,100mi  and the latter 2,000km  1,200mi  ocean currents such as the gulf stream transport eel larvae from the sargasso sea to foraging areas in north america europe and northern africa recent but disputed research suggests that eels possibly use  to navigate through the ocean both as larvae and as adults climate

climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds because of the ocean s great capacity to store and release heat maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates  can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation climatic zones vary with latitude  the warmest zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator the coldest zones are in high latitudes with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas the  and its northern extension towards europe the  is thought to have at least some influence on climate for example the gulf stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern north america keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas the gulf stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the florida peninsula in the higher latitudes the north atlantic drift warms the atmosphere over the oceans keeping the british isles and north-western europe mild and cloudy and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern canada  the  area  and africa s north-western coast in general winds transport moisture and air over land areas natural hazards

capture of atlantic north-west cod in million tons


in 1497  became the first to explore mainland north america and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of  off newfoundland referred to as  newfoundland currency  this discovery supplied mankind with some 200million tons of fish over five centuries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit   and  from the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of european and asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species it also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as   witch flounder and   in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but because this was occurring on  it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made in the early 1990s this finally resulted in the  the population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process including  redfish and greenland halibut together with flounder and grenadier in the eastern central atlantic small  constitute about 50 of landings with sardine reaching 0.61.0 million tons per year pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fishes or overfished with sardines south of  the notable exception almost half of stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels total catches have been fluctuating since the 1970s  reaching 3.9 million tons in 2013 or slightly less than the peak production in 2010 






in the western central atlantic catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 1.3 million tons in 2013 the most important species in the area  reached a million tons in the mid-1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished  was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished  and  are overfished and  and  are considered fully fished approaching overfished 44 of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels 






in the south-east atlantic catches have decreased from 3.3 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.3 million tons in 2013  and  are the most important species together representing almost half of the landings off south africa and namibia  and  have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of  and  have improved to fully fished in 2013 in the south-west atlantic a peak was reached in the mid-1980s and catches now fluctuate between 1.7 and 2.6 million tons the most important species the  which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value is considered fully fished to overfished another important species was the  with a production of 100,000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished half the stocks in this area are being fished at unsustainable levels   has not yet reached fully fished but  is overfished the sea snail  is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished see also   and 
environmental issues 




 strewn over the beaches of the south atlantic 


endangered marine species include the   sea lions turtles and whales  fishing can kill dolphins  and other seabirds     hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes municipal pollution comes from the eastern united states southern brazil and eastern argentina   in the     and   and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the baltic sea north sea and mediterranean sea north atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature  sst  at tropical latitudes changes that can be attributed to either the natural   amo  or to  a 2005 report indicated that the atlantic   amoc  slowed down by 30 between 1957 and 2004 if the amo were responsible for sst variability the amoc would have increased in strength which is apparently not the case furthermore it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity therefore these changes in sst must be caused by human activities the ocean  plays an important role heat storage over seasonal and decadal time-scales whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and has a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer this heat uptake provides a time-lag for climate change but it also results in a thermal expansion of the oceans which contribute to sea-level rise 21st century global warming will probably result in an  rise five times greater than today whilst melting of glaciers including that of the greenland ice-sheet expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century will probably result in a sea-level rise of 36m over a millennium on 7 june 2006 florida s wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state s endangered species list some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature  is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles the biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture  chemicals as well as livestock and human waste the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to  and the creation of a   which is also known as marine litter describes human-created waste floating in a body of water oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of  and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter see also   and
