origin 
founded in 1929 as the  the abc was a government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system the  a  system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas whilst the  b  system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology following the general downward economic trends of the era as entrepreneurial ventures in national infrastructure struggled with viability the  company  was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 july 1932 and renamed as australian broadcasting commission re-aligning more closely to the british bbc model the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983 changed the name of the organisation to the australian broadcasting corporation effective 1 july 1983 although funded and owned by the government the abc remains  as ensured through the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983 the abc is sometimes informally referred to as  aunty  originally in imitation of the  history

over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy the australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the abc and the commercial sector news broadcasts were initially restricted due to pressure from  who controlled many australian newspapers however journalists such as frank dixon and  began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s in 1939 warren denning was appointed to canberra as the first abc political correspondent after murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by  in 1942 the australian broadcasting act was passed giving the abc the power to decide when and in what circumstances political speeches should be broadcast directions from the minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the commission s annual report it was used only once in 1963 in the same year  kindergarten of the air  began on abc radio in perth and was later broadcast nationally cater argues that reform was urgently needed in 1945

criticisms 
as a publicly funded broadcaster the abc is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues and is required to present a range of views with impartiality over the decades accusations of  bias  at the abc have arisen at different times and various inquiries undertaken reviews of the abc are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released a 2004  media credibility survey found that media professionals regarded  as the most accurate news source in the country in mid 2013 the  released a study of the professional views of journalists slightly over half of respondents expected to vote for either  or  whereas just under a third planned to vote  in contrast over 40 of abc journalists would vote for the greens and almost a third labor dr rhonda jolly s 2014 abc overview noted that  many commentators have argued consistently that there is a left wing bias which dominates abc news and programming  and cited a 2005 piece by paul gray that the broadcaster was overly influenced by the  narrow middle-class values of the australian secular left  and said that  while the national broadcaster had at times offended governments of all persuasions it had always adopted a  from the left  perspective  jolly also noted however that supporters of the abc  deny claims that the broadcaster is either intentionally or inadvertently biased  and that  speaking from opposition politicians have praised the abc for its scrutiny of government  the paper noted that in december 2013 abc chairman james spigelman called four independent audits a year in response to the frequent allegations of lack of impartiality in news and current affairs in response to one set of criticisms journalist  who has worked at the abc commented   every single day i see that organisation give voices to australians who otherwise wouldn t be heard on topics that are too uncommercial or too remote or too hard to be covered by anyone else broadcasting into areas from which others have long withdrawn resources

soon after coming to office in 1996 the howard government reduced the abc s operating grants by 10 its appointment of  to the position of managing director was controversial for his program of budget cuts restructuring and the loss of several high-profile personalities and shows shier left the position early on 31 october 2001  anchor kerry o brien opposed howard s budget cuts to the abc and describes the appointment of shier as its managing director as a manifestation of the  conservative obsession with the abc as a kind of biased left-wing culture  in howard s last election he was defeated in the seat of bennelong by labor candidate maxine mckew who had hosted lateline during the howard era peter mares reported for radio national that  some wags described it as an  internal promotion  while others said she d simply moved from the  media wing  to the  political wing  of the alp  mares consulted abc journalist turned nsw liberal mla  who said    i have no doubt there was left-wing bias i certainly thought it when i was there  while mckew said there was no left wing bias though  what i detected years ago in the abc much more of a collectivist philosophy  rudd-gillard-rudd government  20072013
