the u.s navy continues to be a major support to u.s interests in the 21st century since the end of the  it has shifted its focus from preparations for large-scale war with the  to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts the navy participated in   and is a major participant in the ongoing  largely in this capacity development continues on new ships and weapons including the  aircraft carrier and the  because of its size weapons technology and ability to project force far from u.s shores the current u.s navy remains a potent asset for the united states moreover it is the principal means through which the u.s maintains international global order namely by safeguarding global trade and protecting allied nations in 2007 the u.s navy joined with the  and  to adopt a new maritime strategy called  that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war the strategy was presented by the  the  and  at the international sea power symposium in  on 17 october 2007 the strategy recognized the economic links of the global system and how any disruption due to regional crisesman-made or naturalcan adversely impact the u.s economy and quality of life this new strategy charts a course for the navy coast guard and marine corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent these crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to prevent negative impacts on the u.s 
in 2010 chief of naval operations admiral gary roughead noted that demands on the navy have grown as the fleet has shrunk and that in the face of declining budgets in the future the u.s navy must rely even more on international partnerships in its 2013 budget request the navy focused on retaining all eleven big deck carriers at the expense of cutting numbers of smaller ships and delaying the ssbn replacement by the next year the usn found itself unable to maintain eleven aircraft carriers in the face of the expiration of budget relief offered by the  and cno  said that a ten ship carrier fleet would not be able to sustainably support military requirements the british   said that  the usn had switched from  outcome-led to resource-led  planning one significant change in u.s policymaking that is having a major effect on naval planning is the  in response this   has stated that 60 percent of the total u.s fleet will be deployed to the  by the year 2020 the navy s most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan published in 2016 calls for a future fleet of 350 ships in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive international environment
