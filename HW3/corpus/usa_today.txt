in many ways usa today is set up to break the typical newspaper layout some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers  front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages  sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside  the lead reefer is the cover page feature  newsline  which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections as a national newspaper usa today cannot focus on the weather for any one city therefore the entire back page of the news section is used for weather maps for the   and the  and temperature lists for many cities throughout the u.s and the world  temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one or two-letter code such as  t  for  referencing the expected weather conditions  the colorized forecast map originally created by staff designer george rorick  who left usa today for a similar position at  in 1986  was copied by newspapers around the world breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges national precipitation maps for the next three days  previously five days until the 2012 redesign  and four-day forecasts and  for 36 major u.s cities  originally 16 cities prior to 1999   with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map  are also featured weather data is provided by  which has served as the forecast provider for usa today for most of the paper s existence  with an exception from january 2002 to september 2012 when  provided data through a long-term multimedia content agreement with gannett  in the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is  weather focus  a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena on some days the weather focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event on mondays the money section uses its back page for  market trends  a feature that launched in june 2002 and presents an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly monthly and weekly movements against the  on days featuring bonus sections or business holidays the money and life sections are usually combined into one section while combinations of the friday life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks advertising coverage is seen in the monday money section which often includes a review of a current television ad and after  a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ad track live survey stock tables for individual stock exchanges  comprising one subsection for companies traded on the  and another for companies trading on  and the   and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad of electronic ways to check individual stock prices in line with most newspapers book coverage including reviews and a national sales chart  the latter of which debuted on october 28 1994  is seen on thursdays in life with the official full   chart printed on wednesdays or thursdays depending on release the paper also publishes the  survey for several genres of music based on radio airplay spins on tuesdays along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on wednesdays because of the same limitations cited for its nationalized forecasts the television page in life  which provides  and  listings  running from 8 00p.m to 12 30a.m    incorporates a boilerplate   or   descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major english language broadcast networks      and   cede airtime to allow their affiliates to carry  or local newscasts  the television page has never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling information similar to those featured in local newspapers like most national papers usa today does not carry

one of the staples of the news section is  across the usa  a state-by-state roundup of headlines the summaries consist of paragraph-length  reports highlighting one story of note in each state the  and one u.s territory similarly the  for the record  page of the sports section  which features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and individual non-league events seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for the current day s games  also features a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for  and individual multi-state lotteries some traditions have been retained however the  still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the news section stock and mutual fund data are presented in the money section but usa today is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight even in a mix of other newspapers such as at a  the overall design and layout of usa today has been described as neo-victorian also in most of the sections  front pages on the lower left hand corner are  usa today snapshots  which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in  for example a snapshot in  life  could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time  these  snapshots  are shown through graphs which are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter  using the example above the graph s bars could be made up of several tv sets or ended by one  these are usually loosely based on research by a national institute  with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph  the newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called open air which launched on march 7 2008 and appears several times a year various other  appear throughout the year mainly on fridays opinion section
