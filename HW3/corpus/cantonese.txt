the de facto standard pronunciation of cantonese is that of canton  guangzhou  which is described in the cantonese phonology article  has some minor variations in phonology but is largely identical to standard guangzhou cantonese in hong kong and macau certain phoneme pairs have caused one sound to merge into another although termed as  lazy sound    and considered substandard to guangzhou pronunciation the phenomenon has been widespread in the territories since the early 20th century the most notable difference between hong kong and guangzhou pronunciation is the substitution of the liquid nasal  l  for the nasal initial  n  in many words an example of this is manifested in the word for you   pronounced as nih in guangzhou and as lih in hong kong another key feature of hong kong cantonese is the merging of the two syllabic nasals   and  m  this can be exemplified in the elimination of the contrast of sounds between    a surname   ng4 gh in guangzhou pronunciation  and   not   mh4 mh in guangzhou pronunciation  in hong kong both words are pronounced as the latter lastly the initials  k  and  k  can be merged into  k  and  k  when followed by   an example is in the word for country   pronounced in standard guangzhou as gwok but as gok with the merge unlike the above two differences this merge is found alongside the standard pronunciation in hong kong rather than being replaced educated speakers often stick to the standard pronunciation but can exemplify the merged pronunciation in casual speech in contrast less educated speakers pronounce the merge more frequently less prevalent but still notable differences found among a number of hong kong speakers include 

merging of   initial into null initial merging of   and  k  codas into  n  and  t  codas respectively eliminating contrast between these pairs of finals  except after  e  and  o   an  a   at  ak   n    t  k   n   and  t  k  merging of the rising tones   2nd and  5th  
cantonese vowels tend to be traced further back to  back than their mandarin analogues such as m  a  vs c  i  m  i  vs c  i  m   vs c   m   vs c  ou  etc for consonants some differences include m   t t  vs c  h k k  m   vs c  j  and a greater syllable coda diversity in cantonese  such as syllables ending intp ork  tones 
generally speaking cantonese is a  with six phonetic tones historically finals that end in a  were considered as   and treated separately by  convention identifying cantonese with nine tones however phonetically these are now considered a conflation of tone and final consonant and are seldom counted as individual tones in modern linguistics

as cantonese is used primarily in hong kong macau and other overseas chinese communities it is usually written with  however it includes extra characters as well as characters with different meanings from  due to the presence of words that either do not exist in standard chinese or correspond with spoken cantonese this system of  is often found in colloquial contexts such as entertainment magazines and social media as well as on advertisements in contrast standard written chinese continues to be used in formal literature professional and government documents and news media nevertheless colloquial characters may be present in formal written communications such as legal testimonies and newspapers when an individual is being quoted rather than paraphrasing spoken cantonese into standard written chinese romanization 
cantonese romanization systems are based on the accent of canton and hong kong and have helped define the concept of standard cantonese the major systems are  the chinese government s   and  while they do not differ greatly yale is the one most commonly seen in the west today  the hong kong linguist  modified the yale system for his popular cantonese-as-a-second-language course and is still widely in use today the cantonese romanization systems of  are slightly different from  s the spellings are basically influenced by the  however some words under the macau s romanization systems are same as hong kong s  e.g lam  chan   words with the alphabet  u  under hong kong s romanization systems are often replaced by  o  under macao s romanization systems  e.g chau vs chao  leung vs leong   both the spellings of hong kong and macao cantonese romanization systems do not look similar to the mainland china s pinyin system generally plain stops are written with voiced consonants  p   t   ts  and  k  as b d z j and g respectively  and aspirated stops with unvoiced ones as in  and  early western effort 
systematic efforts to develop an alphabetic representation of cantonese began with the arrival of protestant missionaries in china early in the nineteenth century romanization was considered both a tool to help new missionaries learn the variety more easily and a quick route for the unlettered to achieve gospel literacy earlier catholic missionaries mostly portuguese had developed romanization schemes for the pronunciation current in the court and capital city of china but made few efforts to romanize other varieties  the first  missionary in china published a  vocabulary of the canton dialect   1828  with a rather unsystematic romanized pronunciation  and  in their  chinese chrestomathy in the canton dialect   1841  were the progenitors of a long-lived lineage of related romanizations with minor variations embodied in the works of   and   1910  bridgman and williams based their system on the phonetic alphabet and diacritics proposed by  for south asian languages their romanization system embodied the phonological system in a local dialect rhyme dictionary the fenyun cuoyao which was widely used and easily available at the time and is still available today samuel wells willams  tonic dictionary of the chinese language in the canton dialect  yinghua fenyun cuoyao 1856  is an alphabetic rearrangement translation and annotation of the fenyun to adapt the system to the needs of users at a time when there were only local variants and no standardalthough the speech of the western suburbs xiguan of guangzhou was the prestige variety at the timewilliams suggested that users learn and follow their teacher s pronunciation of his chart of cantonese syllables it was apparently bridgman s innovation to mark the tones with an open circle  upper register tones  or an underlined open circle  lower register tones  at the four corners of the romanized word in analogy with the traditional chinese system of marking the tone of a character with a circle  lower left for  even  upper left for  rising  upper right for  going  and lower right for  entering  tones   in his  english and cantonese pocket-dictionary   1859  simplified the marking of tones using the acute accent to mark  rising  tones and the grave to mark  going  tones and no diacritic for  even  tones and marking upper register tones by italics  or underlining in handwritten work   entering  tones could be distinguished by their consonantal ending  used chalmers romanization in his primer this method of marking tones was adopted in the yale romanization  with low register tones marked with an  h  a new romanization was developed in the first decade of the twentieth century which eliminated the diacritics on vowels by distinguishing vowel quality by spelling differences  e.g a aa o oh  diacritics were used only for marking tones the name of tipson is associated with this new romanization which still embodied the phonology of the fenyun to some extent it is the system used in meyer-wempe and cowles  dictionaries and o melia s textbook and many other works in the first half of the twentieth century it was the standard romanization until the yale system supplanted it the distinguished linguist  developed a cantonese adaptation of his  system the  romanization system was first used in chao s cantonese primer published in 1947 by harvard university press  the cantonese primer was adapted for mandarin teaching and published by harvard university press in 1948 as mandarin primer  the bc system was also used in textbooks published by the hong kong government cantonese romanization in hong kong
