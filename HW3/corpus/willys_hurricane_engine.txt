design 
the hurricane was based on the earlier go-devil  to get more power from the engine the induction system was changed from the go-devil s side-valve configuration to an  this allowed the valves to be larger and the combustion chamber to be smaller improving flow and increasing the  the compression ratio rose from 6.5 1 in the go-devil engine to 7.5 1 in the hurricane engine although a version of the hurricane engine was made with a 6.9 1 compression ratio f134 
the  was updated with the f-head to become the f134 in 1950 this engine produced a gross output of 75hp  56kw  76ps  at 4000rpm and 114lbft  155nm  of torque at 2000rpm with a 7.5 1 compression ratio the gross power and torque outputs fell to 72hp  54kw  73ps  and 112lbft  152nm  respectively when the engine had a 6.9 1 compression ratio bore and stroke dimensions were the same as the l-head engine at 318  x 438  giving 134.2cuin  2,199cc  the f4-134 was introduced in 1950 in the  vehicles with this engine were given the model designation 4-73 this engine was not placed in a cj until the introduction of the cj-3b in 1953 which had a distinctive high hood to accommodate the much taller engine the engine remained in production until 1971 after   amc  purchased kaiser jeep applications

the f6-161 hurricane is an f-head version of the l6-161 lightning flathead straight six it was used in the model 685 station wagon bf-161 the bf-161 has a 318 inch bore and a 312 inch stroke a one-barrel  and an output of 90hp  67kw  91ps  at 4400rpm and 135lbft  183nm  of torque at 2000rpm its 161.1cuin  2,640cc  displacement features a compression ratio of 7.6 1 2600 the 2600 was essentially the same bf-161 engine made in brazil by willys-overland s subsidiary but it had two one-barrel carburetors  simultaneously opened  and had an output of 130hp  97kw  132ps  at 4400rpm and 140lbft  190nm  of torque at 2000rpm the compression ratio remained 7.6 1 3000 the 3-liter version is almost identical to the bf-161 engine with the stroke increased to 4 inches  100mm  giving it a displacement of 3,016cc  184.0cuin  with a 2-barrel carburetor it produced 140hp  104kw  142ps  at 4400rpm and 161lbft  218nm  of torque at 2000rpm it also had a slightly higher compression ratio of 8 1 it initially used a different head with removable intake manifold later after ford acquired willys-overland do brasil they reverted the engine to its former head design with integral intake manifold improved cooling between cylinders 5 and 6 and installed a side-mounted oil filter instead of the front-mounted hose connected arrangement used by willys applications

the 6-226  super hurricane  was a l-head 6-cylinder from  with a bore of 3516inches and stroke of 438inches giving a displacement of 226.2cuin  3,707cc  horsepower rating is 105hp  78kw  106ps  at 3600rpm or 115hp  86kw  117ps  at 3650rpm as well as a torque rating of 190lbft  258nm  at 1400rpm or at 1800rpm depending on the year of production mitsubishi versions 
mitsubishi built a version of the hurricane from 1954 as the jh4  69 hp  mostly for use in their license-built version of the  they later developed a 61ps  45kw   diesel version of the same called  this was also turned into a 3.3 liter six-cylinder version with the same internal dimensions producing 85ps  63kw  which was named ke36 these diesel engines were used in the jeep but also in a number of light to medium-weight trucks and buses references
