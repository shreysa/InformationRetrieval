the monsoon trough is a portion of the  as depicted by a line on a  showing the locations of minimum sea level pressure and as such is a  between the wind patterns of the southern and northern hemispheres westerly  winds lie in its equatorward portion while easterly  exist poleward of the trough right along its axis heavy rains can be found which usher in the peak of a location s respective  as it passes poleward of a location hot and dry conditions develop the monsoon trough plays a role in creating many of the world s  the term  monsoon trough  is most commonly used in monsoonal regions of the western pacific such as asia and australia the migration of the itcz monsoon trough into a landmass heralds the beginning of the annual rainy season during summer months depressions and  often form in the vicinity of the monsoon trough with each capable of producing a year s worth of rainfall in a matter of days

february position of the itcz and monsoon trough in the pacific ocean depicted by area of convergent streamlines offshore australia and in the equatorial eastern pacific


monsoon troughing in the western pacific reaches its zenith in  during the late summer when the wintertime surface ridge in the opposite hemisphere is the strongest it can reach as far as the 40th parallel in east asia during august and the 20th parallel in australia during february its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure over the warmest part of the various continents in the  the monsoon trough associated with the australian monsoon reaches its most southerly latitude in february oriented along a west-northwest east-southeast axis effect of wind surges 
increases in the relative  or spin with the monsoon trough are normally a product of increased wind convergence within the  of the monsoon trough wind surges can lead to this increase in convergence a strengthening or equatorward movement in the  can cause a strengthening of a monsoon trough as a wind surge moves towards the location of the monsoon trough as  move through the  and  of one  during their winter normally as  when their temperature gradient becomes minimal wind surges can cross the equator in oceanic regions and enhance a monsoon trough in the other hemisphere s summer a key way of detecting whether a wind surge has reached a monsoon trough is the formation of a burst of thunderstorms within the monsoon trough embedded depressions

if a circulation forms within the monsoon trough it is able to compete with the neighboring  over the continent and a wind surge will occur at its periphery such a circulation which is broad in nature within a monsoon trough is known as a monsoon depression in the northern hemisphere monsoon depressions are generally asymmetric and tend to have their strongest winds on their eastern periphery light and variable winds cover a large area near their center while bands of showers and thunderstorms develop within their area of circulation the presence of an upper level  poleward and west of the system can enhance its development by leading to increased diverging air aloft over the monsoon depression which leads to a corresponding drop in surface pressure even though these systems can develop over land the outer portions of monsoon depressions are similar to tropical cyclones in india for example 6 to 7 monsoon depressions move across the country yearly and their numbers within the  increase during july and august of  events monsoon depressions are efficient rainfall producers and can cause a year s worth of rainfall when they move through drier areas such as the  of australia roles

a monsoon trough is a significant genesis region for rich low level environments with significant low level spin lead to a better than average chance of tropical cyclone formation due to their inherent rotation this is because a pre-existing near-surface disturbance with sufficient spin and convergence is one of the six requirements for  there appears to be a 15 to 25-day cycle in thunderstorm activity associated with the monsoon trough which is roughly half the wavelength of the  or mjo this mirrors tropical cyclone genesis near these features as genesis clusters in 23weeks of activity followed by 23weeks of inactivity tropical cyclones can form in outbreaks around these features under special circumstances tending to follow the next cyclone to its poleward and west whenever the monsoon trough on the eastern side of the summertime asian monsoon is in its normal orientation  oriented east-southeast to west-northwest   along its periphery will move with a westward motion if it is reverse oriented or oriented southwest to northeast tropical cyclones will move more poleward tropical cyclone tracks with s shapes tend to be associated with reverse-oriented monsoon troughs the  and south american convergence zones are generally reverse oriented the failure of the monsoon trough or itcz to move south of the equator in the eastern pacific ocean and atlantic ocean during the southern hemisphere summer is considered one of the reasons that tropical cyclones normally do not form in those regions it has also been noted that when the monsoon trough lies near  in the pacific the frequency of tropical cyclones is 2 to 3 times greater than when it lies closer to  references
