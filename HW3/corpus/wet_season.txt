in areas where the heavy rainfall is associated with a wind shift the wet season is known as the monsoon rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions further much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour before the storms mature into their stratiform stage most places have only one wet season but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons because the monsoon trough or  can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year however since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year they do not have a wet season it is different for places with a  in the western united states during the cold season from septembermay  from the  move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the  during the cold season this shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems the  of  has weather very similar to the western united states in this regard areas affected 
areas with a  climate in  such as      and  have a distinct rainy season also within the savanna climate regime  and  have a rainy season monsoon regions include the    including  and   northern sections of  s north   western and southern  the desert southwest of the united states southern  portions of northeast  northern  has two wet seasons  one in early spring and the other in early winter in western africa there are two rainy seasons across southern sections but only one across the north within the mediterranean climate regime the west coast of the united states and the  coastline of italy greece and turkey experience a wet season in the winter months similarly the wet season in the  of  extends from october through may at the boundary between the mediterranean and monsoon climates lies the  which receives the two rainy seasons associated with each climate regime the wet season is known by many different local names throughout the world for example in mexico it is known as  storm season  different names are given to the various short  seasons  of the year by the aboriginal tribes of   the wet season typically experienced there from december to march is called gudjewg the precise meaning of the word is fairly disputable although it is widely accepted to relate to the severe thunderstorms flooding and abundant vegetation growth commonly experienced at this time effects

in tropical areas when the monsoon arrives high daytime high temperatures drop and overnight low temperatures increase thus reducing  during the wet season a combination of heavy rainfall and in some places such as  an onshore wind improve  in brazil the wet season is correlated with weaker  off the ocean the  level of water becomes more balanced due to the charging of local  during the wet season water also softens as the concentration of dissolved materials reduces during the rainy season erosion is also increased during rainy periods  that are dry at other times of the year fill with runoff in some cases with water as deep as 10 feet  3.0m  leaching of soils during periods of heavy rainfall depletes nutrients the higher runoff from land masses affects nearby ocean areas which are more  or less mixed due to stronger surface currents forced by the heavy rainfall runoff floods 
high rainfall can cause widespread flooding which can lead to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes the  which only flows during india s monsoon season can flood and severely damage local crops floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season which cause soils which are sandy or composed of  to become hydrophobic or water repellent in various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding instructions on controlling erosion through outreach  are also provided by telephone or the internet life adaptations

the wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime however this also means that wet season is a time for food shortages before crops reach their full maturity this causes seasonal weight changes for people in developing countries with a drop occurring during the wet season until the time of the first harvest when weights rebound malaria incidence increases during periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall animals
