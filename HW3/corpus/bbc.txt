the birth of british broadcasting 1920 to 1922 
britain s first live public broadcast from the marconi factory in chelmsford took place in june 1920 it was sponsored by the  s  and featured the famous australian soprano  the melba broadcast caught the people s imagination and marked a turning point in the british public s attitude to radio however this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications by late 1920 pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority the   gpo  was sufficient to lead to a ban on further chelmsford broadcasts but by 1922 the gpo had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the united states the gpo proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufactures to be known as the   a scottish calvinist was appointed its general manager in december 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast the company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of bbc wireless receiving sets from approved manufacturers to this day the bbc aims to follow the reithian directive to  inform educate and entertain  from private company towards public service corporation 1923 to 1926 
the financial arrangements soon proved inadequate set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets by mid-1923 discussions between the gpo and the bbc had become deadlocked and the postmaster-general commissioned a review of broadcasting by the  the committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the bbc s immediate financial distress and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the gpo this was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufactures protection expired the bbc s broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence as was the prohibition on advertising the bbc was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19.00 and required to source all news from external wire services mid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration this time by the crawford committee by now the bbc under reith s leadership had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified  monopoly  broadcasting service but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with reith keen that the bbc be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise the recommendations of the crawford committee were published in march the following year and were still under consideration by the gpo when the  broke out in may the strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production and with restrictions on news bulletins waived the bbc suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis the crisis placed the bbc in a delicate position on one hand reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the bbc at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the bbc were to step out of line but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently the government was divided on how to handle the bbc but ended up trusting reith whose opposition to the strike mirrored the pm s own thus the bbc was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government s objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing the resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the pm had broadcast to the nation from reith s home using one of reith s sound bites inserted at the last moment or that the bbc had banned broadcasts from the  and delayed a peace appeal by the  supporters of the strike nicknamed the bbc the bfc for british falsehood company reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from blake s   signifying that england had been saved while the bbc tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers jean seaton professor of media history and the official bbc historian has characterised the episode as the invention of  modern propaganda in its british form  reith argued that trust gained by  authentic impartial news  could then be used impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself the bbc did well out of the crisis which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting and it was followed by the government s acceptance of the recommendation made by the crawford committee  192526  that the british broadcasting company be replaced by a non-commercial crown-chartered organisation  the british broadcasting corporation 1927 to 1939

the success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the bbc and well established media such as theatres concert halls and the recording industry by 1929 the bbc complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting because they feared it harmed the artist  by making his material stale  and that it  reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer  on the other hand the bbc was  keenly interested  in a cooperation with the recording companies who  in recent years have not been slow to make records of singers orchestras dance bands etc who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless  radio plays were so popular that the bbc had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929 most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting   day in and day out manuscripts come in and nearly all go out again through the post with a note saying  we regret etc  in the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at st george s hall langham place by  who held the official role of bbc staff theatre organist from 1936 to 1938  foort continued to work for the bbc as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following experimental television broadcasts were started in 1930 using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by  limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934 and an expanded service  now named the   started from  in 1936 alternating between an improved baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic  marconi-emi system the superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year 1939 to 2001

competition to the bbc was introduced in 1955 with the commercial and independently operated television network of  however the bbc monopoly on radio services would persist until 8 october 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed   iba  the uk s first independent local radio station  came on-air in the london area as a result of the  report of 1962 in which the bbc was praised for the quality and range of its output and itv was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming the decision was taken to award the bbc a second television channel  in 1964 renaming the existing service  bbc2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across europe bbc2 was broadcast in colour from 1 july 1967 and was joined by bbc1 and itv on 15 november 1969 the 405 line  transmissions of bbc1  and itv  were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985 starting in 1964 a series of  stations  starting with   came on the air and forced the british government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services in response the bbc reorganised and renamed their radio channels on 30 september 1967 the light programme was split into  offering continuous  popular  music and  more  easy listening  the  third  programme became  offering classical music and cultural programming the home service became  offering news and non-musical content such as quiz shows readings dramas and plays as well as the four national channels a series of local bbc radio stations were established in 1967 including  in 1969 the bbc enterprises department was formed to exploit bbc brands and programmes for commercial  products in 1979 it became a wholly owned limited company bbc enterprises ltd in 1974 the bbc s  service  was introduced created initially to provide subtitling but developed into a news and information service in 1978 bbc staff went on strike just before the christmas of that year thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one since the deregulation of the uk television and radio market in the 1980s the bbc has faced increased competition from the commercial sector  and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster   especially on satellite television cable television and  services

the licence fee has however attracted criticism it has been argued that in an age of multi stream multi-channel availability an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate the bbc s use of private sector company  to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments or do not require a tv licence the bbc uses advertising campaigns to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee past campaigns have been criticised by  mp  and former mp  for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the bbc s comprehensive database there are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee the majority of the bbc s commercial output comes from its commercial arm  who sell programmes abroad and exploit key brands for merchandise of their 2012 13 sales 27 were centred on the five key  superbrands  of     known as  internationally  the bbc s archive of natural history programming  collected under the umbrella of   and the  now sold  travel guide brand  expenditure
