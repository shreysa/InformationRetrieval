 undergoing rapid intensification


rapid intensification is a  condition that occurs when a tropical cyclone intensifies dramatically in a short period of time the united states national hurricane center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots  35mph  55km h  in a 24-hour period

necessary conditions
in order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place  must be extremely warm  near or above 30c 86f  and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not churn deeper cooler waters up to the surface  must be low  when wind shear is high the  and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted internal 
usually an  in the upper layers of the  above the storm must be present as wellfor extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the  of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently   have been implicated in tropical cyclone rapid intensification though diagnostically has seen varied skill across basins previous nomenclature and definitions 
the united states national hurricane center previously defined rapid deepening of a tropical cyclone when the minimum central pressure decreased by 42 millibars  1.240inhg  over a 24-hour period  however it is now defined as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots  35mph  55km h  in a 24-hour period the term  has been confused with rapid intensification in the literature  however due to the redefinition based on sustained wind speeds rapid intensification is being applied to tropical systems while explosive cyclogenesis and associated terms to  

in 1983  underwent one of the most explosive deepening events ever recorded with the pressure dropping from 975 to 885 millibars as it went from a tropical storm to a category 5 super typhoon in 24 hours in 1992  was just a minimum hurricane a day before making landfall in the  when it began to rapidly deepen into a category 5 hurricane right up to its landfall at peak strength it weakened significantly over the island chain but it soon hit open water again and rapidly intensified back into a category 5 hurricane just hours before making a second landfall at category 5 strength in florida on september 10 1997  was just a tropical storm the next day linda became a minimal hurricane by 6am on september 12 however linda s wind speeds increased to a record 185mph the pressure dropping at an average rate of 3.38 millibars per hour in 2004  was approaching the west coast of  as a category two storm on the  of hurricane strength when just off the coast however its sustained winds rapidly increased from 110 to 150mph  along with a pressure drop from 965 to 941mbar  in only three hours charley caused unprecedented destruction in the  area and inflicted major damage across the state of florida 



hurricane wilma at record intensity


during 2005  sustained winds rapidly intensified from 60 knots  70mph  110km h  to 150 knots  175mph  280km h  within 24 hours as a result wilma intensified from being a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale over the same time span the pressure dropped from 982 millibars  29.00inhg  to 892 millibars  26.34inhg   and  both rapidly intensified katrina from a category 2 to a 5 and rita from a 2 to a 5 katrina rapidly weakened as a result dropping one category every 6 hours rita kept cat 5 intensity for 24 hours before slowly weakening to a category 3 and dropping to a cat 1 just after landfall in  the minimum central pressure of  in the western pacific dropped 75 mbar in 24 hours including a 60 mbar pressure drop in 6 hours as it intensified from a tropical storm to a category four equivalent typhoon in one advisory in   rapidly intensified from a tropical depression to a category 5 hurricane in 51 hours with a wind speed rise of 85knots 98mph in just 24 hours 2008 s  with the hurricane undergoing a 24 millibar pressure drop in 3 hours in 2010 there were multiple occurrences     and  are prime examples each intensified from a minimal hurricane into a category 4  category 3 for karl  in 2013 typhoon  underwent a 55 mb drop as it had intensified from a category 1 to a category 4 super typhoon in just 24 hours typhoon  rapidly intensified from a category 1 to category 5 in 24 hours and most notably  deepened from 35 mb within 12 hours and 965 mb to 895 mb within a day in 2014 cyclones  and  underwent rapid intensification going from tropical storms to category 5 cyclones in less than 48 hrs barely a week apart a few instances have been recorded in the  such as the  the strongest storm on record in the basin undergoing a 28 millibar pressure drop in 6 hours and  undergoing 24 millibar drop in 6 hours in may 2014  rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to a category4 in 24hours over the span of 30hours its central pressure decreased by 62mbar  hpa  1.83inhg  while its winds increased by 95mph  153km h  in august 2014  underwent explosive intensification while crossing the international date line from a tropical storm to a category 5 typhoon in 30 hours with a wind speed rise of 90 knots  rapidly deepened from category 1 at 2 00 pm pdt on august 23 to category 5 with sustained winds of 160mph  gusting to 195mph  at 2 00 pm pdt on august 24 the pressure dropping from 988mbar to 918mbar  an average of 2.916 millibars per hour  during that same period in september 2014  rapidly intensified from a category 1 into a category 4 with pressure dropping to 918 mbar  intensified from a tropical storm into a category 4 hurricane
in october 2014  deepened 30 mbar in 6 hours and 65 mbar in just a day in november 2014  explosively intensified from a tropical storm to a category 5 super typhoon in 18 hours its pressure had dropped from 975 mbar to 910 mbar in december 2014  explosively intensified from a category 3 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon for 12 hours with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 215km h  130mph  and the central pressure at 905   26.72   in february 2015 tropical  developed in the coral sea of the queensland coast in australia it was named a category 1  australian scale  cyclone by the bureau of meteorology on 18 february and underwent a period of very rapid intensification on 19 february reaching category 4 status the following morning it was upgraded to category 5 status before crossing the coast north of yeppoon queensland meanwhile in the northwest pacific  rapidly deepened 45  in 30 hours in late march 2015  rapidly intensified from a category 2 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon in a day and became the strongest storm before april within the basin in early may  also rapidly intensified from a category 2 typhoon to a category 5 super typhoon within a similar timeframe with a 45 millibar drop  rapidly intensified from a category 2 to a category 5 within 24 hours in october 2015  underwent explosive intensification the storm reached hurricane status just before 00 00 on october 22 and reached category 4 status 18 hours later patricia further intensified to reach category 5 status the next day and peaked with winds of 215mph by 12 00 utc on october 23 patricia s winds increased a record 120mph despite this in the five hours until landfall an eyewall replacement cycle resulted in traumatic weakening winds decreased 65mph before landfall however with winds of 150mph patricia still holds the record for the strongest mexican landfall on the pacific side in september 2017  explosively intensified from a category 1 with a pressure of 982 mbar  hpa  29.00 inhg  to a category 5 with a pressure of 925mbar  hpa  28.23 inhg  in under a 24-hour period see also
