the soviet government issued the decree for scientific research test range no 5  niip-5    nauchno-issledovatelskii ispytatelnyi poligon n.5  on 12 february 1955 it was actually founded on 2 june 1955 originally a test center for the world s first  the  niip-5 was soon expanded to include launch facilities for space flights the site was selected by a commission led by gen vasily voznyuk influenced by  the chief designer of the r-7 icbm and soon the man behind the soviet space program it had to be surrounded by plains as the radio control system of the rocket required  at the time  receiving uninterrupted signals from ground stations hundreds of kilometres away additionally the missile trajectory had to be away from populated areas also it is an advantage to place a space launch site closer to the equator as the surface of the earth has higher rotational speed there taking these constraints into consideration the commission chose tyuratam a village in the heart of the  the expense of constructing the launch facilities and the several hundred kilometres of new road and train lines made the cosmodrome one of the most costly infrastructure projects the soviets undertook  a supporting town was built around the facility to provide housing schools and infrastructure for workers it was raised to city status in 1966 and named  the american  found and photographed the tyuratam missile test range for the first time on 5 august 1957 name 
there are conflicting sources about origins of the name baikonur some sources say that it was not until 1961  i.e until gagarin s flight  when the name was deliberately chosen to misdirect the west to a place about 320 kilometres  199mi  northeast of the launch center the small mining town of baikonur near  other sources state that baikonur was name of the  region even before the cosmodrome existed the main cosmodrome-supporting town leninsk was renamed to  on 20 december 1995 by  environmental impact 
russian scientist  researched mass animal deaths in the 1990s and concluded that the mass deaths of birds and wildlife in the  were noted only along the flight paths of space rockets launched from the baikonur cosmodrome dead wildlife and livestock were usually incinerated and the participants in these incinerations including tobonov himself his brothers and inhabitants of his native village of eliptyan commonly died from stroke or cancer in 1997 the ministry of defense of the russian federation changed the flight path and removed the ejected rocket stages near  russia 
scientific literature collected enough data that confirmed adverse effects of rockets on environment and health of the population heptyl or  a fuel used in russian rocket engines is considered to be highly toxic it is one of the reasons for acid rains and cancers in the local population near the cosmodrome valery yakovlev a head of the laboratory of ecosystem research of the state scientific-production union of applied ecology  kazmechanobr  notes   scientists have established the extreme character of destructive influence of  baikonur  space center on environment and population of the region  11 000 tons of space scrap metal polluted by especially toxic heptyl is still laying on the falling grounds  
importance 
many historic flights lifted off from baikonur  the first operational   the first man-made satellite  on 4 october 1957  the first spacecraft to travel close to the moon  on 2 january 1959  the first manned and orbital flight by  on 12 april 1961  and the flight of the first woman in space  in 1963 14 cosmonauts of 13 other nations such as    and  started their journeys from here as well under the  program in 1960 a prototype  icbm  killing over 100 people baikounr is also the site where  and  were launched from russian era 




a soyuz rocket is erected into position at the baikonur cosmodrome s  on 24 march 2009 the rocket launched the crew of  and a spaceflight participant on 26 march 2009 

following the  in 1991 the russian space program continued to operate from baikonur under the auspices of the  russia wanted to sign a 99-year lease for baikonur but agreed to a  115 million annual lease of the site for 20 years with an option for a 10-year extension on 8 june 2005 the  ratified an agreement between  and  extending russia s rent term of the spaceport until 2050 the rent pricewhich remained fixed at us 115,000,000 per year  is the source of a long-running dispute between the two countries in an attempt to reduce its dependency on baikonur russia is constructing the  in  with the retirement of the american space shuttle program baikonur has been the only launch site for  missions using russian spacecraft following the conclusion of the  russian spacecraft are now the only means by which astronauts can travel to the international space station making baikonur the sole launch site used for manned missions to the iss features 
baikonur is fully equipped with facilities for launching both manned and unmanned  it supports several generations of  spacecraft       and  during the temporary lapse of the    program after the  in 2003 it played an essential role in operating and resupplying of the   iss  with  and  spacecraft its high latitude of 46 n required the high orbital inclination of the iss downrange from the launchpad spent launch equipment is dropped directly on the ground where it is salvaged by the workers and the local population list of launchpads

buran facilities 
main article  
as part of the  several facilities were adapted or newly built for the buran-class space shuttle orbiters 

  used for the launch of the buran-class orbiters like the assembly and processing hall at site 112 the launch complex was originally constructed for the  and later converted for the energia-buran program site 112  used for orbiter maintenance and to mate the orbiters to their  launchers  thus fulfilling a role similar to the  at   the main hangar at the site called mik rn or mik 112 was originally built for the assembly of the  after cancellation of the n-1 program in 1974 the facilities at site 112 were converted for the energia-buran program it was here that  was stored after the end of the buran program and was destroyed when the hangar roof collapsed in 2002 site 251  used as buran orbiter landing facility also known as yubileyniy airfield  and fulfilling a role similar to the  at   it features one runway called 06 24 which is 4,500 metres  4,900yd  long and 84 metres  92yd  wide paved with  grade 600  high quality reinforced concrete at the edge of the runway was a special  designed to lift an orbiter off its  carrier aircraft and load it on a transporter which would carry the orbiter to the processing building at site 254 a purpose-built orbiter landing control facility housed in a large multi-store office building was located near the runway yubileyniy airfield was also used to receive heavy transport planes carrying elements of the energia-buran system after the end of the buran program site 251 was abandoned but later reopened as a commercial cargo airport besides serving baikonur kazakh authorities also use it for passenger and charter flights from russia site 254  built to service the buran-class orbiters between flights  thus fulfilling a role similar to the  at   constructed in the 1980s as a special four-bay building it also featured a large processing area flanked by several floors of test rooms after cancellation of the buran program it was adapted for pre-launch operations of the  and  spacecraft 
baikonur railway 




soyuz tma-16 launch vehicle being transported to launchpad at baikonur in 2009 

all baikonur s  are based on its own intra-site   network which is the largest  on the planet the railway is used for all stages of launch preparation and all spacecraft are transported to the launchpads by the special  once part of the  the baikonur railway is now served by a dedicated civilian state company there are several rail links connecting the baikonur railway to  and the rest of the world baikonur airports 
the baikonur cosmodrome has two on-site multi-purpose  serving both the personnel transportation needs and the logistics of space launches  including the delivery of the spacecraft by planes  there are scheduled passenger services from  to the smaller    bxy  uaol  which however are not accessible to the public the larger yubileyniy airport       uaon  was where the  was transported to baikonur on the back of the  cargo aircraft icbm testing 
although baikonur has always been known around the world as the launch site of soviet and russian space missions from its outset in 1955 and until the collapse of the ussr in 1991 the primary purpose of this center was to test liquid-fueled  the official  and secret  name of the center was state test range no 5 or 5 gik it remained under control of the soviet and  until the second half of the 1990s when the russian civilian space agency and its industrial contractors started taking over individual facilities 
in 2006 the head of roskosmos  said that the last russian military personnel would be removed from the baikonur facility by 2007 however on 22 october 2008 an  missile was test fired from baikonur indicating this may not be the case future projects 
on 22 december 2004 kazakhstan and russia signed a contract establishing the  russiakazakhstan baiterek jv  joint venture in which each country holds a 50-percent stake the goal of the project is the construction of the    tree  space launch complex to facilitate operations of the russian  rocket launcher this will allow launches with a payload of 26 tons to  compared to 20 tons using the  system an additional benefit will be that the angara uses kerosene as fuel and oxygen as the oxidiser which is less hazardous to the environment than the toxic fuels used by older boosters the total expenditure on the kazakh side will be  223 million over 19 years as of 2010 the project was stalling due to insufficient funding it was thought that the project still had good chances to succeed because it will allow both parties  russia and kazakhstan  to continue the joint use of baikonur even after the  is commissioned the first scheduled launch of the baiterek rocket and space complex is scheduled for 2025 baikonur museum 
baikonur cosmodrome has a small museum next to two small cottages once residences of  and  both cottages are part of the museum complex and have been preserved the museum is home to a collection of space artifacts a restored test artifact from the soviet  sits next to the museum entrance the vehicle that flew a single orbital test mission in 1988 was destroyed in a hangar collapse in 2002  for a complete list of buran artifacts see  the museum also houses photographs related to the cosmodrome s history including images of all cosmonauts every crew of every expedition launched from baikonur leaves behind a signed crew photograph that is displayed behind the glass baikonur s museum holds many objects related to gagarin including the ground control panel from his flight his uniforms and soil from his landing site preserved in a silver container one of the museum rooms also holds an older version of the soyuz descent capsule in popular culture 

in  the baikonur cosmodrome was a  shipyard where the ss tsiolkovsky was launched in  us and chinese forces guard the facility against gla attack however their failure allows the gla to attack the world using mirvs launched from this facility 
in its expansion pack  us forces destroy the facility after the gla attack in northern europe 

in  this facility is featured as the main location of the mission  executive order  involving sabotage of the soviet space program and is the location of the multiplayer map  launch  as well as the zombies map  ascension  in  in the final episode  century of shame  koko and valmet are at the cosmodrome with kasper jonah and chiquita as koko launches the final rocket much of  episode   takes place atop a rocket at the facility in  the fictional russian federal bureau of aeronautics   in  old russia  is based on the baikonur cosmodrome also old russia the first location in-game is based off the cosmodrome in  the baikonur cosmodrome is an important plot element providing transportation back to second earth over a span of several episodes the protagonists travel across asia to baikonur and attempt to board a space shuttle at the cosmodrome in the book  by  juan cabrillo relates how he had infiltrated the facility to sabotage a fictional  which was being launched on an energia rocket in the book locked on by tom clancy the cosmodrome is seized by dagestani terrorists under orders from rogue elements in the pakistani isi threatening to destroy moscow with stolen nuclear weapons in order to force the russian government into granting dagestan and chechnya independence in the game  the monument  launch site  is heavily inspired by the cosmodrome
