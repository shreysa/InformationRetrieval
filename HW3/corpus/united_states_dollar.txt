the american  was initially based on the value and look of the spanish dollar used widely in  from the 16th to the 19th centuries the first dollar coins issued by the   founded 1792  were similar in size and composition to the spanish dollar minted in mexico and peru the spanish u.s silver dollars and later mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the united states and the spanish dollar and mexican peso remained legal tender until the  the coinage of various english colonies also circulated the  was popular in the dutch new netherland colony  new york  but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the english colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable thus they were sometimes referred to as  dog dollars  the u.s dollar was first defined by the coinage act of 1792 which specified a  dollar  to be based in the spanish milled dollar and of 371  and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or 416 grains  27.0g  of standard silver and an  eagle  to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or 270 grains  17g  of gold  again depending on purity  the choice of the value 371 grains arose from  s decision to base the new american unit on the average weight of a selection of worn spanish dollars hamilton got the treasury to weigh a sample of spanish dollars and the average weight came out to be 371 grains a new spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight and so the new u.s dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the spanish dollar the same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at 10 dollars and the dollar at 110 eagle it called for 90 silver alloy coins in denominations of 1 12 14 110 and 120 dollars  it called for 90 gold alloy coins in denominations of 1 12 14 and 110 eagles the value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods this allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation s economy the early currency of the united states did not exhibit faces of presidents as is the custom now  although today by law only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on united states currency in fact the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency a practice compared to the policies of european monarchs the currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century  before that  heads  side of coinage used profile faces and striding seated and standing figures from greek and roman mythology and composite native americans the last coins to be converted to profiles of historic americans were the dime  1946  and the dollar  1971  for articles on the currencies of the colonies and states see             and  continental currency

continental currency  badly during the war giving rise to the famous phrase  not worth a continental  a primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between congress and the states which continued to issue bills of credit additionally neither congress nor the governments of the several states had the will or the means to retire the bills from circulation through taxation or the sale of bonds the currency was ultimately replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1 silver dollar to 1000 continental dollars silver and gold standards 
from 1792 when the  was passed the dollar was defined as 371.25   24.056 g  of silver many historians  erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver  however there is no evidence of congress making this law this has to do with  s suggestion to congress of a fixed 15 1 ratio of silver to gold respectively the gold coins that were minted however were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the congressional standard of the silver dollar 1834 saw a shift in the  to 23.2 grains  1.50g  followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22 grains  1.505g  in 1837  16 1 ratio

technically all these coins are still legal tender at face value though some are far more valuable today for their  value and for gold and silver coins their  value from 1965 to 1970 the  was the only circulating coin with any silver content which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel however since 1992 the u.s mint has produced special silver proof sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes quarters and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions in addition an experimental  coin was also minted in 1879 but never placed into circulation and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination the  50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the  celebrating the opening of the  only 1,128 were made 645 of which were octagonal  this remains the only u.s coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest u.s coin ever produced a  100 gold coin was produced in high relief during 2015 although it was primarily produced for collectors not for general circulation from 1934 to present the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny nickel dime quarter half dollar and dollar the nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged  except in its design  from its original version every year since 1866 the nickel has been 75 copper and 25 nickel except for 4 years during  when nickel was needed for the war due to the penny s low value some  as circulating coinage collector coins 
the united states mint produces proof sets specifically for collectors and speculators silver proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime quarter and half dollar containing 90 silver starting in 1983 and ending in 1997 the mint also produced proof sets containing the year s commemorative coins alongside the regular coins another type of proof set is the presidential dollar proof set where four special  1 coins are minted each year featuring a president because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins the production of new presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on december 13 2011 by u.s treasury secretary timothy f geithner future minting of such coins will be made solely for collectors
