the fujiwhara effect sometimes referred to as fujiwara interaction or binary interaction is when two nearby    each other and close the distance between the circulations of their corresponding  the effect is named after  the japanese meteorologist who initially described the effect binary interaction of smaller circulations can cause the development of a larger cyclone or cause two cyclones to merge into one  typically engage in binary interaction when within 2,000 kilometres  1,200mi  of one another while  typically interact within 1,400 kilometres  870mi  of each other

description 




diagram of the fujiwhara effect showing how 2 tropical cyclones interact with each other 

when cyclones are in proximity of one another their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically  counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere  about a point between the two systems due to their cyclonic wind circulations the two vortices will be attracted to each other and eventually spiral into the center point and merge it has not been agreed upon whether this is due to the divergent portion of the  or  advection when the two vortices are of unequal size the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction and the smaller vortex will orbit around it the effect is named after sakuhei fujiwhara the japanese meteorologist who initially described it in a 1921 paper about the motion of vortices in water tropical cyclones

tropical cyclones can  when smaller circulations within the  merge the effect is often mentioned in relation to the motion of tropical cyclones although the final merging of the two storms is uncommon the effect becomes noticeable when they approach within 1,400 kilometres  870mi  of each other rotation rates within binary pairs accelerate when tropical cyclones close within 650 kilometres  400mi  of each other merger of the two systems  or shearing out of one of the pair  becomes realized when they are within 300 kilometres  190mi  of one another examples

binary interaction is seen between nearby extratropical cyclones when within 2,000 kilometres  1,200mi  of each other with significant acceleration occurring when the low-pressure areas are within 1,100 kilometres  680mi  of one another interactions between their circulations at the 500 hpalevel  18,000feet above   behave more predictably than their surface circulations this most often results in a merging of the two low-pressure systems into a single extratropical cyclone or can less commonly result in a mere change of direction of one or both of the cyclones the precise results of such interactions depend on factors such as the size of the two cyclones their distance from each other and the prevailing atmospheric conditions around them
