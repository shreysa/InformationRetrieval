background 





tracks of all known category 5 atlantic hurricanes between 1851 and 2014


a category5 atlantic hurricane is one that is considered by the united states   nhc  to have had sustained wind speeds greater than 136 knots  157mph  252km h  70m s  on the  the nhc considers sustained wind speeds to be those that occur over a one-minute period at 10 metres  32.8ft  above ground these wind speeds are estimated by using a blend of data from a variety of sources which include observations from nearby ships reconnaissance aircraft or automatic weather stations and pictures from various satellites between  and  33 hurricanes were recorded at category5 strength no category5 hurricanes were observed officially before 1924 it can be presumed that earlier storms reached category5 strength over open waters but the strongest winds were not measured the  a device used for measuring wind speed was invented in 1846 however during major hurricane strikes the instruments as a whole were often blown away leaving the hurricane s peak intensity unrecorded for example as the  of 1879 struck north carolina the anemometer cups were blown away when indicating 138mph  222km h  a  of weather data is ongoing by researchers who may upgrade or downgrade other atlantic hurricanes currently listed at categories 4 and 5 for example the  is suspected to have reached category 5 strength furthermore  research aims to identify past major hurricanes by comparing sedimentary evidence of recent and past hurricane strikes for example a  giant hurricane  significantly more powerful than   category 5  has been identified in  sediment having struck the region sometime

officially the decade with the most category5 hurricanes is 20002009 with eight category5 hurricanes having occurred  isabel  2003  ivan  2004  emily  2005  katrina  2005  rita  2005  wilma  2005  dean  2007  and felix  2007  the previous decades with the most category5 hurricanes were the 1930s and 1960s with six occurring between 1930 and 1939  before naming began  nine atlantic hurricanes        and reached category5 intensity on more than one occasion  that is by reaching category5 intensity weakening to a category4 or lower and then becoming a category5 again such hurricanes have their dates shown together camille andrew dean felix irma and maria each attained category 5 status twice during their lifespans allen isabel and ivan reached category 5 intensity on three separate occasions however no atlantic hurricane has reached category5 intensity more than three times during its lifespan the november 1932 cuba hurricane holds the record for most time spent as a category5  although it took place before satellite or aircraft reconnaissance so this record may be somewhat suspect  irma holds the record for longest continuous span as a category 5 storm in the satellite era thirty-three category5s have been recorded in the  since 1851 when records began only one category 5 has been recorded in july eight in august nineteen in september five in october and one in november there have been no officially recorded june or off-season category5 hurricanes the july and august category5s reached their high intensities in both the  and the  these are the areas most favorable for tropical cyclone development in those months september sees the most category5 hurricanes this coincides with the climatological peak of the atlantic hurricane season which occurs in early september september category5s reached their strengths in any of the   and open atlantic these places are where september tropical cyclones are likely to form many of these hurricanes are either  which develop their strength by having a great deal of open water  or so-called bahama busters which intensify over the warm  in the gulf of mexico all six category5s in october and november reached their intensities in the western caribbean a region that atlantic hurricanes strongly gravitate toward late in the season this is due to the climatology of the area which sometimes has a high-altitude  that promotes rapid intensification late in the season as well as warm waters systems




 a landfalling category5


all atlantic category5 hurricanes have made landfall at some location at hurricane strength most category5 hurricanes in the atlantic make landfall because of their proximity to land in the caribbean and gulf of mexico where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land as opposed to the westward oceanic mean track of eastern pacific hurricanes sixteen of the storms made landfall while at category5 intensity  2007 and 2017 are the only years in which two storms made landfall at this intensity many of these systems made landfall shortly after weakening from a category5 this weakening can be caused by dry air near land shallower waters due to  interaction with land or cooler waters near shore in southern florida the return period for a category5 hurricane is roughly once every 50 years the following table lists these hurricanes by  intensity
