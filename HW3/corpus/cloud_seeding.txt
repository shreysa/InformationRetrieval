this article is about weather modification it is not to be confused with  



cloud seeding can be done by ground generators plane or rocket






this image explaining cloud seeding shows the chemical either silver iodide or dry ice being dumped onto the cloud which then becomes a rain shower the process shown in the upper-right is what is happening in the cloud and the process of condensation to the introduced chemicals 

cloud seeding is a form of  a way of changing the amount or type of  that falls from  by dispersing substances into the  that serve as  or  which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud the usual intent is to increase precipitation  rain or snow  but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports cloud seeding also occurs due to  in nature most of which are bacterial in origin

methodology 
the most common  used for cloud seeding include   and   solid    which expands into a gas has also been used this can produce ice crystals at higher temperatures than silver iodide after promising research the use of  materials such as table salt is becoming more popular when cloud seeding increased snowfall takes place when temperatures within the clouds are between 19 and 4f  7 and 20c  introduction of a substance such as silver iodide which has a  structure similar to that of ice will induce   in mid-altitude clouds the usual seeding strategy has been based on the fact that the equilibrium  is lower over ice than over water the formation of ice particles in supercooled clouds allows those particles to grow at the expense of liquid droplets if sufficient growth takes place the particles become heavy enough to fall as precipitation from clouds that otherwise would produce no precipitation this process is known as  static  seeding seeding of warm-season or tropical  convective  clouds seeks to exploit the  released by freezing this strategy of  dynamic  seeding assumes that the additional latent heat adds buoyancy strengthens updrafts ensures more low-level convergence and ultimately causes rapid growth of properly selected clouds cloud seeding chemicals may be dispersed by aircraft or by dispersion devices located on the ground  generators or canisters fired from  or   for release by aircraft silver iodide  are ignited and dispersed as an aircraft flies through the inflow of a cloud when released by devices on the ground the fine particles are carried downwind and upward by  after release an electronic mechanism was tested in 2010 when   pulses were directed to the air above  by researchers from the  the experimenters posited that the pulses would encourage atmospheric  and  to form particles that would then act as seeds effectiveness 
cloud seeding has never been statistically proven to work an ecologist at stanford university says  i think you can squeeze out a little more snow or rain in some places under some conditions but that s quite different from a program claiming to reliably increase precipitation 
claims are made that new technology and research has produced reliable results that make cloud seeding a dependable and affordable water supply practice for many regions but while practiced widely around the world the effectiveness of cloud seeding is still a matter of academic debate in 2003 the   nrc  released a report stating science is unable to say with assurance which if any seeding techniques produce positive effects in the 55 years following the first cloud-seeding demonstrations substantial progress has been made in understanding the natural processes that account for our daily weather yet scientifically acceptable proof for significant seeding effects has not been achieved 13
referring to 1903 1915 1919 1944 and 1947 weather modification experiments the australian federation of meteorology discounted  rain making  by the 1950s the  division of radiophysics switched to investigating the physics of clouds and had hoped by 1957 to better understand these processes by the 1960s the dreams of weather making had faded only to be re-ignited post-corporatisation of the  in order to achieve  above target  water this would provide enhanced energy generation and profits to the public agencies that are the principal owners recently in 2017 this process had been used by the uae for it had been forecasted that it won t rain for the whole year in the uae
cloud seeding has been shown to be effective in altering cloud structure and size and in converting supercooled liquid water to ice particles the amount of precipitation due to seeding is difficult to quantify there is statistical evidence for seasonal precipitation increases of about 10 percent with winter seeding clouds were seeded during the  in beijing using rockets to coax rain showers out of clouds before they reached the olympic city so that there would be no rain during the  and  ceremonies although others dispute their claims of success a 2010  study claimed that the common practice of cloud seeding to improve rainfall with materials such as  and frozen carbon dioxide seems to have little if any impact on the amount of precipitation a 2011 study suggested that airplanes may produce ice particles by freezing cloud droplets that cool as they flow around the tips of propellers over wings or over jet aircraft and thereby unintentionally seed clouds this could have potentially serious consequences for particular  formation impact on environment and health 
with an  health hazard rating of 2  can cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury to humans and mammals with intense or chronic exposure however there have been several detailed ecological studies that showed negligible environmental and health impacts the toxicity of silver and silver compounds  from silver iodide  was shown to be of low order in some studies these findings likely result from the minute amounts of silver generated by cloud seeding which are about one percent of industry emissions into the atmosphere in many parts of the world or individual exposure from tooth fillings accumulations in the soil vegetation and surface runoff have not been large enough to measure above natural background a 1995 environmental assessment in the sierra nevada of california and a 2004 independent panel of experts in australia confirmed these earlier findings  in 1978 an estimated 2,740  of silver were released into the us environment this led the us health services and epa to conduct studies regarding the potential for environmental and human health hazards related to silver these agencies and other state agencies applied the clean water act of 1977 and 1987 to establish regulations on this type of pollution 
cloud seeding over a biosphere reserveis problematic in that several rapid changes of environmental legislation were made to enable the trial environmentalists are concerned about the uptake of elemental silver in a highly sensitive environment affecting the pygmy possum among other species as well as recent high level algal blooms in once pristine glacial lakes research 50 years ago and analysis by the former snowy mountains authority led to the cessation of the cloud seeding program in the 1950s with non-definitive results formerly cloud seeding was rejected in australia on environmental grounds because of concerns about the protected species the pygmy possum since silver iodide and not elemental silver is the cloud seeding material the claims of negative environmental impact are disputed by peer-reviewed research as summarized by the international weather modification association history of cloud seeding

  19061993  discovered the principle of cloud seeding in july 1946 through a series of serendipitous events following ideas generated between him and nobel laureate  while climbing mt washington in new hampshire schaefer langmuir s research associate created a way of experimenting with super-cooled clouds using a deep freeze unit of potential agents to stimulate ice crystal growth i.e table salt talcum powder soils dust and various chemical agents with minor effect then one hot and humid july 14 1946 he wanted to try a few experiments at general electric s  research lab he was dismayed to find that the deep freezer was not cold enough to produce a  cloud  using breath air he decided to move the process along by adding a chunk of  just to lower the temperature of his experimental chamber to his astonishment as soon as he breathed into the deep freezer he noted a bluish haze followed by an eye-popping display of millions of microscopic ice crystals reflecting the strong light rays from the lamp illuminating a cross-section of the chamber he instantly realized that he had discovered a way to change super-cooled water into ice crystals the experiment was easily replicated and he explored the temperature gradient to establish the 40c limit for liquid water within the month schaefer s colleague the noted atmospheric scientist dr   brother of novelist   was credited with discovering another method for  seeding  super-cooled cloud water vonnegut accomplished his discovery at the desk looking up information in a basic chemistry text and then tinkering with silver and iodide chemicals to produce  together with professor henry chessin suny albany a crystallographer he co-authored a publication in science and received a patent in 1975 both methods were adopted for use in cloud seeding during 1946 while working for the general electric corporation in the state of new york schaefer s method altered a cloud s heat budget vonnegut s altered formative crystal structure an ingenious property related to a good match in  between the two types of   the  of ice later played a role in kurt vonnegut s novel   the first attempt to modify natural clouds in the field through  cloud seeding  began during a flight that began in upstate  on 13 november 1946 schaefer was able to cause snow to fall near  in western massachusetts after he dumped six pounds of  into the target cloud from a plane after a 60-mile easterly chase from the  dry ice and silver iodide agents are effective in changing the physical chemistry of super-cooled clouds thus useful in augmentation of winter snowfall over mountains and under certain conditions in lightning and  suppression while not a new technique  seeding for enhancement of rainfall in warm clouds is enjoying a revival based on some positive indications from research in south africa mexico and elsewhere the hygroscopic material most commonly used is table salt it is postulated that hygroscopic seeding causes the droplet size spectrum in clouds to become more maritime  bigger drops  and less continental stimulating rainfall through coalescence from march 1967 until july 1972 the us military s  cloud-seeded silver iodide to extend the monsoon season over north vietnam specifically the ho chi minh trail the operation resulted in the targeted areas seeing an extension of the monsoon period an average of 30 to 45 days the 54th weather reconnaissance squadron carried out the operation to  make mud not war  one private organization that offered during the 1970s to conduct weather modification  cloud seeding from the ground using silver iodide flares  was irving p krick and associates of  they were contracted by  in 1972 to conduct a seeding project to increase warm cloud rainfall in the   that lake was at that time  197273  the primary water supply for   and was dangerously low the project did not operate for a long enough time to show statistically any change from natural  
an attempt by the united states military to modify  in the  using cloud seeding in the 1960s was called  only a few hurricanes were tested with cloud seeding because of the strict rules set by the scientists of the project it was unclear whether the project was successful hurricanes appeared to change slightly in structure but only temporarily the fear that cloud seeding could potentially change the course or power of hurricanes and negatively affect people in the storm s path stopped the project 
two federal agencies have supported various weather modification research projects which began in the early-1960s  the   reclamation  department of the interior  and the   noaa  department of commerce  reclamation sponsored several cloud seeding research projects under the umbrella of project skywater from 1964 to 1988 and noaa conducted the atmospheric modification program from 1979 to 1993 the sponsored projects were carried out in several states and two countries  thailand and morocco  studying both winter and summer cloud seeding from 1962 to 1988 reclamation developed cloud seeding applied research to augment water supplies in the western us the research focused on winter orographic seeding to enhance snowfall in the rocky mountains and sierra nevada and precipitation in coast ranges of southern california in california reclamation partnered with the california department of water resources   to sponsor the serra cooperative pilot project  scpp  based in auburn ca to conduct seeding experiments in the central sierra the university of nevada and  provided cloud physics physical chemistry and other field support the high plains cooperative pilot project  hiplex  focused on convective cloud seeding to increase rainfall during the growing season in montana kansas and texas from 1974 to 1979 in 1979 the  and other member-states led by the  conducted a precipitation enhancement project  pep  in spain with inconclusive results due probably to location selection issues reclamation sponsored research at several universities including colorado state university universities of wyoming washington ucla utah chicago nyu montana colorado and research teams at stanford meteorology research inc and penn state university and south dakota school of mines and technology north dakota texas a m texas tech and oklahoma cooperative efforts with state water resources agencies in california colorado montana kansas oklahoma texas and arizona assured that the applied research met state water management needs the high plains cooperative pilot project also engaged in partnerships with nasa environment canada and the national center for atmospheric research   more recently in cooperation with six western states reclamation sponsored a small cooperative research program called the weather damage modification program from 20022006 in the united states funding for research has declined in the last two decades however the bureau of reclamation sponsored a six-state research program from 20022006 called the  weather damage modification program  a 2003 study by the  urges a national research program to clear up remaining questions about weather modification s efficacy and practice in  the   csiro  conducted major trials between 1947 and the early-1960s
