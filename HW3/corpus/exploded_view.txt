an exploded view drawing is a type of drawing that shows the intended assembly of mechanical or other parts it shows all parts of the assembly and how they fit together in mechanical systems usually the component closest to the center are assembled first or is the main part in which the other parts get assembled this drawing can also help to represent the disassembly of parts where the parts on the outside normally get removed first exploded diagrams are common in descriptive  showing parts placement or parts contained in an assembly or sub-assembly usually such diagrams have the part identification number and a label indicating which part fills the particular position in the diagram many  applications can automatically create exploded diagrams such as  in  in an exploded views the separated parts should be embraced by a bracket to show the relationship or order of assembly of various parts are permissible see image when an exploded view is shown in a figure that is on the same sheet as another figure the exploded view should be placed in brackets exploded views can also be used in  for example in the presentation of landscape design an exploded view can create an image in which the elements are flying through the air above the  almost like a  the locations can be shadowed or dotted in the siteplan of the elements
