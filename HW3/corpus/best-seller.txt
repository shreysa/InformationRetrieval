early best sellers 
the term  best seller  is first known to have been recorded in print in 1889 in the  newspaper the kansas times   star but the phenomenon of immediate popularity goes back to the early days of mass production of printed books for earlier books when the maximum number of copies that would be printed was relatively small a count of editions is the best way to assess sales since effective  was slow to take hold many editions were  well into the period of the  and without effective  in place authors often saw little if any of the revenues for their popular works 
the earliest highly popular books were nearly all religious but the  as a large book remained expensive until the nineteenth century this tended to keep the numbers printed and sold low unlike today it was important for a book to be short to be a bestseller or it would be too expensive to reach a large audience very short works such as  the  and versions of the  were published as cheap  in large numbers of different editions in several languages in the fifteenth century these were probably affordable items for most of the minority of literate members of the population in 16th and 17th century england   1678  and abridged versions of  were the most broadly read books   1719  and   1748  were early eighteenth century short novels with very large publication numbers as well as gaining international success 
 a novel by  became a  cult  object in england and throughout europe with important cultural consequences among those who could afford to purchase books during the era of its publication the same could be said of the works of  particularly his comedic and philosophically satirical novel  which according to recent research sold more than 20,000 copies in its first month alone in 1759 likewise fellow french enlightenment author  especially his   1761  and of  s novel die leiden des jungen werther    1774  as with some modern bestsellers werther spawned what today would be called a  industry with items such as werther eau de cologne and  puppets depicting the main characters being sold in large numbers by the time of  and sir  effective copyright laws existed at least in england and many authors depended heavily on their income from their large royalties america remained a zone of piracy until the mid-nineteenth century a fact of which  and  bitterly complained by the middle of the 19th century a situation akin to modern publication had emerged where most bestsellers were written for a popular taste and are now almost entirely forgotten with odd exceptions such as   remembered only for the line  gone gone and never called me mother  the wildly popular  and  description and types of bestseller 
bestsellers are usually separated into  and  categories different list compilers have created a number of other subcategories the new york times was reported to have started its  children s books  section in 2001 just to move the  books out of the no 1 2 and 3 positions on their fiction chart which the then three-book series had monopolized for over a year bestsellers also may be ranked separately for  and  editions typically a hardcover edition appears first followed in months or years by the much less expensive paperback version hardcover bestseller status may hasten the paperback release of the same or slow the release if hardcover sales are brisk enough some lists even have a third category  bestsellers in the  a hardcover book could be considered a  bestseller  with sales ranging from 4,000 to 25,000 copies per week and in  bestsellers are determined according to weekly rankings in the country s national print sales tracking service  salesdata there are many  bestseller lists  that display anywhere from 10 to 150 titles differences among lists 
bestseller lists may vary widely depending on the method used for calculating sales the  bestseller lists for example use only sales numbers provided by independently owned  non-chain  bookstores while the new york times list includes both wholesale and retail sales from a variety of sources a book that sells well in gift shops and grocery stores may hit a new york times list without ever appearing on an indie list  has only one list not hardcover paperback so that relative sales among these categories can be ascertained lists from  the dominant on-line book retailer are based only on sales from their own web site and are updated on an hourly basis wholesale sales figures are not factored into amazon s calculations numerous web sites offer advice for authors about a temporary method to boost their book higher on amazon s list using carefully timed buying campaigns that take advantage of the frequent adjustments to rankings for example  author  has used this method to create a number of  1 bestsellers the brief sales spike allows authors to tout that their book was an  amazon.com top 100 seller  in marketing materials for books that actually have relatively low sales eventually book buyers may begin to recognize the relative differences among lists and settle upon which lists they will consult to determine their purchases the weight and price of a book may affect its positioning on lists the amazon.com list tends to favor  more expensive books where the shipping charge is a smaller percentage of the overall purchase price or is sometimes free and which tend to be more deeply discounted than paperbacks inexpensive  tend to do better on the new york times list than on amazon s indie and  separate mass market paperbacks onto their own list category structure affects the positioning of a book in other ways a book that might be buried on the indie hardcover fiction list could be positioned very well on the new york times hardcover advice list or the publishers weekly religion hardcover list verifiability 
bestseller reports from companies such as amazon.com which appear to be based strictly on auditable sales to the public may be at odds with bestseller lists compiled from more casual data such as the new york times lists   of  and publishers the exact method for ranking the new york times bestseller lists is a closely guarded secret this situation suggests a similar one in the area of  in 1991  magazine switched its  data from manual reports filed by stores to automated  data collected by a service called  the conversion saw a dramatic shake-up in chart content from one week to the next today many lists come from automated sources booksellers may use their  systems to report automatically to book sense wholesalers such as the giant  have bestseller calculations similar to amazon s but they are available only to subscribing retailers  and other large retail chains collect sales data from retail outlets and their web sites to build their own bestseller lists  u.s is perhaps the most aggressive attempt to produce a completely automatic and trusted set of bestseller lists they claim to be gathering data directly from cash registers at more than 4,500 retail locations including  large chains such as   and  and the general retailer  unlike the consumer-oriented lists bookscan s data is extremely detailed and quite expensive subscriptions to bookscan cost up to  75,000 per year but it can provide publishers and wholesalers with an accurate picture of book sales with regional and other statistical analyses the making of a bestseller 
ultimately having a great number of buyers creates a bestseller  however there is a distinct  making of  process that determines which books have the potential to achieve that status not all publishers rely on nor strive for bestsellers as the survival of  indicates large publishing houses on the other hand are like major record labels and film studios and require consistent high returns to maintain their large overhead thus the stakes are high it is estimated that 200,000 new books are published each year in the u.s and less than 1 achieve bestseller status along the way major players act as gatekeepers and enablers including literary agents editors publishing houses booksellers and the media  particularly publishers of book reviews and bestseller lists  the high visibility of an established and best-selling author is paramount in the equation also in addition to writing the book an author has to acquire representation and negotiate this publishing chain at least one scientific approach to creating bestsellers has been devised in 2004  a  of  and a  theorist at  using amazon.com sales data created a mathematical model for predicting bestseller potential based on very early sales results this information could be used to identify a potential for bestseller status and recommend fine tuned  and  efforts accordingly in 1995 the authors of a book called  colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts the authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to bookscan because of the ancillary benefits of making   speaking engagements more book deals and consulting  the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself the book climbed to  8 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks also peaking at  1 on the  best seller list since such lists hold the power of  chart success often begets more chart success and although such efforts are not illegal they are considered highly unethical by publishers unread bestsellers 
bestsellers have gained such great popularity that it has sometimes become fashionable to purchase them critics have pointed out that just because a book is purchased doesn t mean it will be read the rising length of bestsellers may mean that more of them are simply becoming bookshelf decor in 1985 members of the staff of  placed coupons redeemable for  5 cash inside 70 books that were selling well and none of them were sent in major publishers

while the basic dictionary definition of bestseller is self-evident  a popular top-selling book  the practical cultural definition is somewhat more complex as consumer bestseller lists generally do not detail specific criteria such as numbers sold sales period sales region and so forth a book becomes a bestseller mainly because an  authoritative  source says it is calling a book a  top-selling  title is not so impressive as calling it  the new york times bestseller  although the former phrase is assumed to be derived from sales figures the latter benefits from the high profile of the particular list a book that is identified as a  bestseller  greatly improves its chance of selling to a much wider audience in this way bestseller has taken on its own popular meaning rather independent of empirical data by becoming a compromised product category and in effect attempting to create a marketing image for example a  summer bestseller  is usually determined long before the summer is over and signals a book s suitability for millions of lounging pool-side readers the use of the marketing phrase underground bestseller further illustrates the independent-from-sales self-defining aspect of the term for example publisher harpercollins suggested the bestseller potential of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood  a novel by announcing four years after her award-winning underground bestseller little altars everywhere  in the promotion the book went on to achieve bestseller status in the 1990s in reviews of the 2002 film of the same name the novel s bestseller status was cited routinely as in  compelling adaptation of rebecca wells  bestseller  the famous  publisher at    started to talk about its own  in 2006 and therewith brought a new mode-word into the german speaking european countries connection with the movie industry
