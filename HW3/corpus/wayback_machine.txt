history 

the internet archive launched the wayback machine in october 2001 it was set up by  and  and is maintained with content from   the service enables users to see archived versions of  across time which the archive calls a  three dimensional index  
since 1996 the wayback machine has been archiving cached pages of websites onto its large cluster of  nodes  it revisits sites on occasion  see technical details below  and archives a new version sites can also be captured on the fly by visitors who enter the site s  into a search box  the intent is to capture and archive content that otherwise would be lost whenever a site is changed or closed down  the overall vision of the machine s creators is to archive the entire internet 
information had been kept on digital tape for five years with kahle occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the clunky database when the archive reached its fifth anniversary in 2001 it was unveiled and opened to the public in a ceremony at the  the name wayback machine was chosen as a reference to the    pronounced way-back  a  device used by the characters  and sherman in  an animated cartoon in one of the animated cartoon s component segments  the characters routinely used the machine to witness participate in and more often than not alter famous events in history software has been developed to  the web and download all publicly accessible world wide web pages the  hierarchy the   usenet  bulletin board system and downloadable software the information collected by these  crawlers  does not include all the information available on the internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites archive-it.org was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives crawl are contributed from various sources some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the archive for example crawls are contributed by the  and  crawls run by ia on behalf of  and the  mirrors of  the  worldwide web crawls  have been running since 2010 and capture the global web the frequency of snapshot captures varies per website websites in the  worldwide web crawls  are included in a  crawl list  with the site archived once per crawl a crawl can take months or even years to complete depending on size for example  wide crawl number 13  started on january 9 2015 and completed on july 11 2016 however there may be multiple crawls ongoing at any one time and a site might be included in more than one crawl list so how often a site is crawled varies widely storage capabilities 
as of 2009 the wayback machine contained approximately three  of data and was growing at a rate of 100  each month  the growth rate reported in 2003 was 12 terabytes month the data is stored on  rack systems manufactured by  in 2009 the internet archive migrated its customized storage architecture to  and hosts a new data center in a  on   california campus in 2011 a new improved version of the wayback machine with an updated interface and fresher index of archived content was made available for public testing in march 2011 it was said on the wayback machine forum that  the beta of the new wayback machine has a more complete and up-to-date index of all crawled materials into 2010 and will continue to be updated regularly the index driving the classic wayback machine only has a little bit of material past 2008 and no further index updates are planned as it will be phased out this year  in january 2013 the company announced a ground-breaking milestone of 240 billion urls in october 2013 the company announced the  save a page  feature which allows any internet user to archive the contents of a url this became a threat of abuse by the service for  as of december 2014 the wayback machine contained almost nine  of data and was growing at a rate of about 20  each week as of july 2016 the wayback machine reportedly contained around 15  of data growth 
between october 2013 and march 2015 the website s global alexa rank changed from 162 to 208 
website exclusion policy 
historically wayback machine respected the   robots.txt  in determining if a website would be crawled or not  or if already crawled if its archives would be publicly viewable website owners had the option to opt-out of wayback machine through the use of robots.txt it applied robots.txt rules retroactively  if a site blocked the internet archive any previously archived pages from the domain were immediately rendered unavailable as well in addition the internet archive stated  sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site we comply with these requests  in addition the website says   the internet archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection 
oakland archive policy 
wayback s retroactive exclusion policy is based in part upon recommendations for managing removal requests and preserving archival integrity published by the school of information management and systems at  in 2002 which gives a website owner the right block access to the site s archives  wayback has complied with this policy to help avoid expensive litigation the wayback retroactive exclusion policy began to relax in 2017 when it stopped honoring robots.txt on u.s government and military web sites for both crawling and displaying web pages as of april 2017 wayback is exploring ignoring robots.txt more broadly not just for u.s government websites uses 

the site is frequently used by journalists and citizens to review dead websites dated news reports or changes to website contents its content has been used to hold politicians accountable and expose battlefield lies in 2014 an archived social media page of separatist rebel leader in ukraine  showed him boasting about his troops having  after which he deleted the post and blamed ukraine s military in 2017 the  originated from a discussion on  that indicated someone had visited archive.org and discovered that all references to  had been deleted from the white house website in response a user commented  there needs to be a scientists  march on washington  furthermore the site is used heavily for verification providing access to references and content creation by  netbula llc v chordiant software inc 
in a 2009 case netbula llc v chordiant software inc defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the  file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbula s site pages that chordiant believed would support its case netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbula s website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiant s motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means  without considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations 
magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california san jose division rejected netbula s arguments and ordered them to disable the robots.txt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought telewizja polska 
in an october 2004 case  v echostar satellite no 02 c 3293 65 fed r evid serv 673  n.d ill oct 15 2004  a litigant attempted to use the wayback machine archives as a source of admissible evidence perhaps for the first time telewizja polska is the provider of  and  operates the  prior to the trial proceedings echostar indicated that it intended to offer wayback machine snapshots as proof of the past content of telewizja polska s website telewizja polska brought a motion  to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of  and unauthenticated source but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polska s assertion of hearsay and denied tvp s motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial at the trial however district court judge ronald guzman the trial judge overruled magistrate keys  findings  and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages  i.e the telewizja polska website  were admissible as evidence judge guzman reasoned that the employee s affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticating main article  
provided some additional requirements are met  e.g providing an authoritative statement of the archivist  the  and the  will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as  for instance in examining a patent application limitations of utility 
there are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors for example archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of non e-commerce databases in their archives legal status 
in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the site archived content legal issues 
a number of cases have been brought against the internet archive specifically for its wayback machine archiving efforts scientology

in 2003 harding earley follmer   frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archive s wayback machine the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid based on the content of their website from several years prior the plaintiff healthcare advocates then amended their complaint to include the internet archive accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the  and the  healthcare advocates claimed that since they had installed a  file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine however some material continued to be publicly visible on wayback the lawsuit was settled out of court after wayback fixed the problem suzanne shell 
in december 2005 activist  filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us  100,000 for archiving her website profane-justice.org between 1999 and 2004 internet archive filed a  action in the  on january 20 2006 seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shell s  shell responded and brought a  against internet archive for archiving her site which she alleges is in violation of her  on february 13 2007 a judge for the  dismissed all counterclaims except  the internet archive did not move to dismiss  claims shell asserted arising out of its copying activities which would also go forward on april 25 2007 internet archive and suzanne shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit the internet archive said it has no interest in including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived we recognize that ms shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the wayback machine resulted in this litigation  shell said  i respect the historical value of internet archive s goal i never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm

in 201316 a  tried to remove archived images of himself from the wayback machine s archive first by sending multiple  to the archive and then by appealing to the  censorship and other threats 
archive.org is currently  after the site enabled the encrypted  protocol the internet archive was  in 2015 
alison macrina director of the library freedom project notes that  while librarians deeply value individual privacy we also strongly oppose censorship  there are known rare cases where online access to content which  for nothing  has put people in danger was disabled other threats include natural disasters destruction  remote or physical   manipulation of the archive s contents  see also     problematic copyright laws and surveillance of the site s users kevin vaughan suspects that in the long-term of multiple generations  next to nothing  will survive in a useful way besides  if we have continuity in our technological civilization  by which  a lot of the bare data will remain findable and searchable  some find the internet archive which describes itself to be built for the long-term to be working furiously to capture data before it disappears without any long-term infrastructure to speak of see also
