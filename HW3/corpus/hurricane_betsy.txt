rainfall totals in the united states


the effects of hurricane betsy were of far-reaching and unprecedented severity though the extent of impacts were limited to the bahamas and portions of the united states the damage in these respective regions were considerable according to the  of the  betsy produced category3 winds  111mph  179km h  or greater  in southeastern florida and southeastern louisiana however winds of such intensity were also reported in the bahamas the final enumerated damage figure of  1.425billion in damage costs made betsy the first  in the united states to accrue more than  1billion in damage unadjusted for  for this reason the tropical cyclone was nicknamed  billion dollar betsy  the damage cost remained unsurpassed for four years until  struck similar regions in  betsy remains the 27th  the bahamas 
during betsy s initial approach of the bahamian archipelago on september2 strong surf and high swells were reported in the southeastern islands though no damage was reported much of the damage inflicted to the bahamas by betsy occurred between september68 when the tropical cyclone moved across the northern bahamas as a category3 hurricane the preceding track was similar to that of another   which had also drastically curved southwestward before causing significant damage to the island group likewise betsy was considered the worst hurricane to strike the region since then stalling over the bahamas for a period of time as it moved through the islands several locations sustained the betsy s effects for prolonged periods of time despite the tropical cyclone s relatively small size widespread  and communication blackouts ensued preventing the flow of reports between the northern bahamas and other outlets as the storm took place this included nasa communication centers in cape kennedy which had lost contact with downrange missile tracking stations in the archipelago over the duration of the hurricane the lowest pressure measured was 961mbar  hpa  28.40inhg  in  on  however no wind measurement was recorded alongside the pressure reading due to a resulting power failure offshore the dutch freighter sarah elizabeth was caught in rough seas and had lost control of its rudder while it was pulled by continuous wave action towards  as a result the ship s operators relayed a  signal to which the  responded by dispatching a  and several merchant ships to assist in escorting the stricken freighter to safety however roughly five hours later the crew of the sarah elizabeth was able to navigate to safer waters within the  two luxury  within the harbor were destroyed with dozens of smaller craft damaged as a result of the wind and waves

hurricane betsy slammed into  on the evening of september 9 1965 110mph  180km h  winds and power failures were reported in new orleans the eye of the storm passed to the southwest of new orleans on a northwesterly track the northern and western eyewalls covered southeast louisiana and the new orleans area from about 8 pm until 4 am the next morning in  winds of 130mph  210km h  to 140mph  230km h  were reported the baton rouge weather bureau operated under auxiliary power without telephone communication around 1 am the worst of the wind and rain was over betsy also drove a  into  just north of new orleans and the mississippi river gulf outlet a deep-water shipping channel to the east and south levees for the mississippi river gulf outlet along florida avenue in the  and on both sides of the industrial canal failed the flood water reached the  of houses in some places and over some one story roofs in the lower ninth ward some residents drowned in their attics trying to escape the rising waters these levee breaches flooded parts of  the  and the lower ninth ward of new orleans as well as  and  in neighboring st bernard parish president  visited the city promising new orleans mayor  federal aid it was ten days or more before the water level in new orleans went down enough for people to return to their homes it took even longer than that to restore their flooded houses to a livable condition those who did not have family or friends with dry homes had to sleep in the shelters at night and forage for supplies during the day while waiting for the federal government to provide emergency relief in the form of trailers in all 164,000 homes were flooded at the second landfall evidence suggests that cheap construction and poor maintenance of the structures led to the failure of the levees however popular rumor persists that they were intentionally breached possibly as a means of salvaging the more prosperous   this is however unlikely  even though the french quarter is one of the geographically highest neighborhoods in the city during the first eighty years of the 20th century the french quarter was in fact an unfashionable neighborhood populated mostly by lower income people who were not priced out of the market until well into the 1980s 
many of the barges that had been traveling on the mississippi river were engulfed by the hurricane one of the barges mtc-602 contained 602 tons of deadly chlorine gas contained in cylinders chlorine gas which was used frequently as a  is a powerful irritant that can inflict damage to the eyes nose throat and lungs and  at high concentrations and prolonged exposure  cause death by asphyxiation it was estimated that the amount of chlorine loaded on the barge was enough to kill 40,000 people the barge had sunk near  where an estimated 300,000 people lived the residents in the harbor area were evacuated until the barge was recovered president lyndon b johnson ordered the navy and army engineers to find and raise the barge while it took months to locate and make the appropriate plans for raising the barge the actual process of raising it took around two hours the barge was reportedly recovered without any problems on november 12 1965 mississippi 
the storm produced rainfall high tides and strong winds in mississippi near the border with alabama tides of 7 feet  2.1m  were reported while ranging as high as 15 feet  4.6m  near the state line with louisiana wind speeds also varied greatly throughout the state in  winds between 40 and 65mph  64 and 105km h  were recorded by contrast winds were in excess of 100mph  160km h  in  despite the winds much of the property damage in the state was caused by tides along the gulf coast strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant crop damage in   and  throughout the state 25,000people lost electricity and more than 22,641disruptions to telephone service occurred overall damage in the state of mississippi totaled to  80million  1965usd  alabama

rainfall totals in arkansas


in its early formative stages betsy forced the shortening of nasa s  mission by one orbit due to the tropical storm s forecasted track over the initial target  zone near grand turk island as a result the spacecraft which had been orbiting the earth since august1965 had its target splashdown zone shifted northward to an area of the atlantic ocean well east of jacksonville florida away from the storm s projected path in martinique the precursor tropical depression caused marginal rainfall and light gusts and no damage was reported in  winds and their associated gusts peaked at 35mph  56km h  for several hours on august28 throughout the rest of the windward islands gusts peaked at 40mph  65km h  though the resultant wind damage was marginal as the hurricane was passing near the southeastern bahamas high swells were reported along the northern coast of  though no damage ensued although the more significant effects of hurricane betsy in the united states were limited to

precipitation and resulting flooding there damaged cotton and rice crops much of the rice crop in the eastern and southern portions of the state were flattened by the rains and thus were highly susceptible to future rainfalls a third of cotton much of which defoliated was lost to the rain however these losses were offset by the increased soybean yield resulting from the same rainfall a number of pecan tree limbs were torn down though relative to the overall pecan production for the state these losses were negligible the rains also caused both the  and  in the eastern part of the state to rise from 3ft  0.91m  to 7ft  2.1m  however they did not exceed  betsy s remnants were estimated to have brought winds of 5070mph  80113km h  throughout the state most of the stronger winds were in the northern quadrant of the weakening tropical cyclone as it progressed through arkansas however the highest measured wind gusts were only clocked at 45mph  72km h  in stations at  and  the strong winds tore down power lines leaving hundreds of electricity customers without power for several days however regional electrical crews were able to restore most power by the night of
