extratropical cyclones sometimes called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones are  which along with the  of  drive the weather over much of the earth extratropical  are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild  to heavy    and  these types of cyclones are defined as  low pressure  that occur in the  of the earth in contrast with  extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and  along broad lines called  about the center of the cyclone

terminology 





this animation shows  developing over the united states starting late on october 25 and running through october 27 2010 

the term   applies to numerous types of low pressure areas one of which is the extratropical cyclone the descriptor extratropical signifies that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside the tropics and in the middle  of earth between 30 and 60 latitude they are termed mid-latitude cyclones if they form within those latitudes or  if a tropical cyclone has intruded into the mid latitudes weather forecasters and the general public often describe them simply as   or  lows  terms like frontal cyclone frontal depression frontal low extratropical low non-tropical low and hybrid low are often used as well extratropical cyclones are classified mainly as  because they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint  known as  they can become  late in their life cycle when the distribution of heat around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with its radius formation 




approximate areas of extratropical cyclone formation worldwide






an upper level jet streak div areas are regions of divergence aloft which will lead to surface convergence and aid cyclogenesis 

extratropical cyclones form anywhere within the extratropical regions of the earth  usually between 30 and 60 latitude from the   either through cyclogenesis or extratropical transition a study of extratropical cyclones in the  shows that between the  and  there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6-hour period a separate study in the  suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form each winter cyclogenesis 
main article  
extratropical cyclones form along linear bands of temperature dewpoint gradient with significant vertical  and are thus classified as baroclinic cyclones initially  or low pressure formation occurs along  near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the  known as a jet streak the favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants where  ensues the divergence causes air to rush out from the top of the air column as mass in the column is reduced  at surface level  the weight of the air column  is reduced the lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone  a low pressure system  the lowered pressure acts to draw in air creating  in the low-level wind field low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column making cyclones tend to be cloudy as the cyclone strengthens the cold front sweeps towards the  and moves around the back of the cyclone meanwhile its associated  progresses more slowly as the cooler air ahead of the system is  and therefore more difficult to dislodge later the cyclones  as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front forcing a tongue or  of warm air aloft eventually the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken  can fall very rapidly when there are strong upper level forces on the system when pressures fall more than 1   0.030  per hour the process is called explosive cyclogenesis and the cyclone can be described as a  these bombs rapidly drop in pressure to below 980 millibars  28.94inhg  under favorable conditions such as near a natural  like the  or at a preferred quadrant of an upper level jet streak where upper level divergence is best the stronger the upper level divergence over the cyclone the deeper the cyclone can become hurricane-force extratropical cyclones are most likely to form in the northern atlantic and northern pacific oceans in the months of december and january on 14 and 15 december 1986 an extratropical cyclone near iceland deepened to below 920 hectopascals  27inhg  which is a pressure equivalent to a  in the  the average pressure for cyclones is 980 millibars  28.94inhg  during the winter and 1,000 millibars  29.53inhg  during the summer extratropical transition 




 in the north atlantic after completing its transition to an extratropical cyclone from a hurricane


 often transform into extratropical cyclones at the end of their tropical existence usually between 30 and 40 latitude where there is sufficient  from upper-level troughs or  riding the  for the process of extratropical transition to begin during this process a cyclone in extratropical transition  known across the eastern north pacific and north atlantic oceans as the post-tropical stage  will invariably form or connect with nearby fronts and or troughs consistent with a baroclinic system due to this the size of the system will usually appear to increase while the core weakens however after transition is complete the storm may re-strengthen due to baroclinic energy depending on the environmental conditions surrounding the system the cyclone will also distort in shape becoming less symmetric with time during extratropical transition the cyclone begins to tilt back into the colder airmass with height and the cyclone s primary energy source converts from the release of latent   from thunderstorms near the center  to  processes the low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a  the peak time of  cyclogenesis  the midpoint of this transition  in the north atlantic is in the months of september and october when the difference between the temperature of the air aloft and the  is the greatest leading to the greatest potential for instability on rare occasions an extratropical cyclone can transit into a tropical cyclone if it reaches an area of ocean with warmer waters and an environment with less vertical wind shear an example of this happening is in the  the process known as  tropical transition  involves the usually slow development of an extratropically cold core vortex into a tropical cyclone the  uses the extratropical transition  xt  technique to subjectively estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones becoming extratropical based on visible and infrared  loss of central convection in transitioning tropical cyclones can cause the  to fail  the loss of convection results in unrealistically low estimates using the dvorak technique the system combines aspects of the dvorak technique used for estimating tropical cyclone intensity and the  used for estimating  intensity the technique is applied when a tropical cyclone interacts with a  or loses its central convection while maintaining its forward speed or accelerating the xt scale corresponds to the dvorak scale and is applied in the same way except that  xt  is used instead of  t  to indicate that the system is undergoing extratropical transition also the xt technique is only used once extratropical transition begins  the dvorak technique is still used if the system begins dissipating without transition once the cyclone has completed transition and become  the technique is no longer used structure

surface pressure and wind distribution 




 image of typical extratropical cyclones over the ocean note the maximum winds are on the outside of the occlusion 

the windfield of an extratropical cyclone constricts with distance in relation to surface level pressure with the lowest pressure being found near the center and the highest winds typically just on the cold poleward side of warm fronts occlusions and  where the  is highest the area poleward and west of the cold and warm fronts connected to extratropical cyclones is known as the cold sector while the area equatorward and east of its associated cold and warm fronts is known as the warm sector 



extratropical cyclones are clockwise spinning in the southern hemisphere just like tropical cyclones 

the wind flow around an extratropical cyclone is  in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere due to the   this manner of rotation is generally referred to as cyclonic  near this center the pressure gradient force  from the pressure at the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone  and the coriolis force must be in an approximate balance for the cyclone to avoid collapsing in on itself as a result of the difference in pressure the central pressure of the cyclone will lower with increasing maturity while outside of the cyclone the  is about average in most extratropical cyclones the part of the cold front ahead of the cyclone will develop into a warm front giving the frontal zone  as drawn on   a wave-like shape due to their appearance on satellite images extratropical cyclones can also be referred to as frontal waves early in their life cycle in the  an old name for such a system is  warm wave  in the northern hemisphere once a cyclone occludes a trough of warm air aloftor  trowal  for shortwill be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast and ultimately into its northwestern periphery  also known as the warm conveyor belt  forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front the trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head due to thelike shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature it can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection vertical structure 
extratropical cyclones slant back into colder air masses and strengthen with height sometimes exceeding 30,000feet  approximately 9km  in depth above the surface of the earth the air temperature near the center of the cyclone is increasingly colder than the surrounding environment these characteristics are the direct opposite of those found in their counterparts   thus they are sometimes called  cold-core lows  various charts can be examined to check the characteristics of a cold-core system with height such as the 700 millibars  20.67inhg  chart which is at about 10,000 feet  3,048 meters  altitude cyclone phase diagrams are used to tell whether a cyclone is tropical subtropical or extratropical cyclone evolution 




a  in january 2016 with a distinct eye-like feature caused by a warm seclusion


there are two models of cyclone development and lifecycles in common usethe norwegian model and the shapiro-keyser model norwegian cyclone model 
of the two theories on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle the older is the norwegian cyclone model developed during  in this theory cyclones develop as they move up and along a frontal boundary eventually  and reaching a barotropically cold environment it was developed completely from surface-based weather observations including descriptions of clouds found near frontal boundaries this theory still retains merit as it is a good description for extratropical cyclones over continental landmasses shapiro-keyser model 
a second competing theory for extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the shapiro-keyser model developed in 1990 its main differences with the norwegian cyclone model are the fracture of the cold front treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector  to the warm front this model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest atlantic warm seclusion 
a warm seclusion is the mature phase of the extratropical cyclone lifecycle this was conceptualized after the  field experiment of the late 1980s which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure secluded  or surrounded  by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds the  as developed by the  largely observed cyclones at the tail end of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages warm seclusions may have cloud-freelike features at their center  reminiscent of   significant pressure falls hurricane-force winds and moderate to strong  the most intense warm seclusions often attain pressures less than 950millibars  28.05inhg  with a definitive lower to mid-level warm core structure a warm seclusion the result of a baroclinic lifecycle occurs at latitudes well poleward of the tropics as latent heat  releases are important for their development and intensification most warm seclusion events occur over the   they may impact coastal nations with hurricane force  and torrential  climatologically the northern hemisphere sees warm seclusions during the cold season months while the southern hemisphere may see a strong cyclone event such as this during all times of the year in all tropical basins except the northern indian ocean the extratropical transition of a tropical cyclone may result in reintensification into a warm seclusion for example  of 2005 reintensified into a strong baroclinic system and achieved warm seclusion status at maturity  or lowest pressure  motion

extratropical cyclones are generally driven or  steered  by deep westerly winds in a general west to east motion across both the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth this general motion of atmospheric flow is known as  zonal  where this general trend is the main steering influence of an extratropical cyclone it is known as a   when the general flow pattern buckles from a zonal pattern to the meridional pattern a slower movement in a north or southward direction is more likely  patterns feature strong amplified troughs and ridges generally with more northerly and southerly flow changes in direction of this nature are most commonly observed as a result of a cyclone s interaction with other    or with  a strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone such  are quite normal and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone the weakening of the anticyclone a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone s periphery or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions it is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances where an extratropical cyclone encounters another extratropical cyclone  or almost any other kind of cyclonic  in the atmosphere  the two may combine to become a binary cyclone where the vortices of the two cyclones rotate around each other  known as the   this most often results in a merging of the two low pressure systems into a single extratropical cyclone or can less commonly result in a mere change of direction of either one or both of the cyclones the precise results of such interactions depend on factors such as the size of the two cyclones their strength their distance from each other and the prevailing atmospheric conditions around them effects
extratropical cyclones can bring mild weather with a little rain and surface  of 1530km h  9.318.6mph  or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding 119km h  74mph   sometimes referred to as  in europe  the band of  that is associated with the  is often extensive in mature extratropical cyclones an area known as the comma head on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation frequent  and  cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress during  winter and spring the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the  to cause snowfall severe weather 
squall lines or solid bands of strong thunderstorms can form ahead of cold fronts and  due to the presence of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence leading to  and high winds when significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold front in the presence of a strong upper level jet stream  formation is possible although tornadoes can form anywhere on earth the greatest number occur in the  in the united states because downsloped winds off the north-south oriented  which can form a dryline aid their development at any  explosive development of extratropical cyclones can be sudden the storm known in the uk as the   deepened to 953 millibars  28.14inhg  with a highest recorded wind of 220km h  140mph  resulting in the loss of 19 lives 15million trees widespread damage to homes and an estimated economic cost of 1.2billion  2.3billion  although most tropical cyclones that become extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system they can still retain winds of hurricane or gale force in 1954  became extratropical over  as a strong category3 storm the  which evolved from the remains of typhoon freda caused heavy damage in  and  with widespread damage equivalent to at least a category3 in 2005  began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting category3-force winds  and became fully extratropical as a category1 storm  in summer extratropical cyclones are generally weak but some of the systems can cause significant  overland because of torrential rainfall the  never broughtforce sustained winds but it caused devastating floods in  resulting in at least 184 deaths and 33.19 billion  4.96 billion  of damage climate and general circulation 
in the classic analysis by   the lorenz energy cycle  extratropical cyclones  so-called atmospheric transients  acts as a mechanism in converting potential energy that is created by pole to equator temperature gradients to eddy kinetic energy in the process the pole-equator temperature gradient is reduced  i.e energy is transported poleward to warm up the higher latitudes  the existence of such transients are also closely related to the formation of the icelandic and aleutian low the two most prominent general circulation features in the mid to sub-polar northern latitudes the two lows are formed by both the transport of kinetic energy and the latent heating  the energy released when water phase changed from vapor to liquid during precipitation  from the extratropical cyclones historic storms
