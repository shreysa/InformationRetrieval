an example of a mechanical system  a satellite is orbiting the earth influenced only by the conservative gravitational force  its mechanical energy is therefore conserved the satellite is accelerated towards the earth with an acceleration perpendicular to the velocity this acceleration is represented by a green acceleration vector and the velocity is represented by a red velocity vector though the velocity is constantly changed with the direction of the vector because of the acceleration vector the speed of the satellite is not since the magnitude of the velocity vector remains unchanged 

in the  mechanical energy is the sum of  and  it is the  associated with the motion and position of an object the principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to  the mechanical energy is constant if an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force the potential energy will increase and if the   not the   of the object is changed the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well in all real systems however  like  will be present but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy s being constant can therefore be a useful approximation in  the mechanical energy is conserved but in  some mechanical energy is converted into heat the equivalence between lost mechanical energy   and an increase in  was discovered by  many devices are used to convert mechanical energy to or from other forms of energy e.g an  converts  to mechanical energy an  converts mechanical energy into  and a  converts  energy to mechanical energy

general 
energy is a  quantity and the mechanical energy of a system is the sum of the potential energy which is measured by the position of the parts of the system the kinetic energy which is also called the energy of motion 



the potential energy u depends on the position of an object subjected to a  it is defined as the object s ability to do  and is increased as the object is moved in the opposite direction of the direction of the force if f represents the conservative force and x the position the potential energy of the force between the two positions x1 and x2 is defined as the negative integral of f from x1 to x2 







the kinetic energy k depends on the speed of an object and is the ability of a moving object to do work on other objects when it collides with them it is defined as one half the product of the object s mass with the square of its speed and the total kinetic energy of a system of objects is the sum of the kinetic energies of the respective objects 







the principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if a body or system is subjected only to  the mechanical energy of that body or system remains constant the difference between a conservative and a  is that when a conservative force moves an object from one point to another the work done by the conservative force is independent of the path on the contrary when a non-conservative force acts upon an object the work done by the non-conservative force is dependent of the path conservation of mechanical energy 





mit professor  demonstrating conservation of mechanical energy


according to the principle of conservation of mechanical energy the mechanical energy of an  remains constant in time as long as the system is free of  and other non-conservative forces in any real situation frictional forces and other non-conservative forces are present but in many cases their effects on the system are so small that the principle of conservation of mechanical energy can be used as a fair  though energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system it can be  to another form of energy swinging pendulum 




a swinging pendulum with the velocity vector  green  and acceleration vector  blue  the magnitude of the velocity vector the speed of the pendulum is greatest in the vertical position and the pendulum is farthest from earth in its extreme positions 

main article  
in a  like a swinging  subjected to the conservative  where frictional forces like air drag and friction at the pivot are negligible energy passes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy but never leaves the system the pendulum reaches greatest kinetic energy and least potential energy when in the vertical position because it will have the greatest speed and be nearest the earth at this point on the other hand it will have its least kinetic energy and greatest potential energy at the extreme positions of its swing because it has zero speed and is farthest from earth at these points however when taking the frictional forces into account the system loses mechanical energy with each swing because of the work done by the pendulum to oppose these non-conservative forces irreversibilities 
main article  
that the loss of mechanical energy in a system always resulted in an increase of the system s temperature has been known for a long time but it was the amateur physicist  who first experimentally demonstrated how a certain amount of work done against friction resulted in a definite quantity of  which should be conceived as the random motions of the particles that comprise matter this equivalence between mechanical energy and heat is especially important when considering colliding objects in an  mechanical energy is conserved  the sum of the mechanical energies of the colliding objects is the same before and after the collision after an  however the mechanical energy of the system will have changed usually the mechanical energy before the collision is greater than the mechanical energy after the collision in inelastic collisions some of the mechanical energy of the colliding objects is transformed into kinetic energy of the constituent particles this increase in kinetic energy of the constituent particles is perceived as an increase in temperature the collision can be described by saying some of the mechanical energy of the colliding objects has been converted into an equal amount of heat thus the total energy of the system remains unchanged though the mechanical energy of the system has reduced satellite

plot of kinetic energy  gravitational potential energy  and mechanical energy versus distance away from centre of earth r at r  re r  2 re r 3 re and lastly r   geostationary radius


a satellite of mass  at a distance  from the centre of earth possesses both kinetic energy   by virtue of its motion  and gravitational potential energy   by virtue of its position within the earths gravitational field  earth s mass is   hence mechanical energy  of a satellite is given by






if the satellite is in circular orbit the energy conservation equation can be further simplified into



since in circular motion newton s 2nd law of motion can be taken to be



conversion 
today many technological devices convert mechanical energy into other forms of energy or vice versa these devices can be placed in these categories 

an  converts  into mechanical energy a  converts mechanical energy into electrical energy a  converts the mechanical energy of water in a storage dam into electrical energy an  is a  that obtains mechanical energy from  by burning  from this mechanical energy the internal combustion engine often generates electricity a  converts the  of steam into mechanical energy a  converts the kinetic energy of a stream of gas or liquid into mechanical energy 
distinction from other types 
the classification of energy into different types often follows the boundaries of the fields of study in the natural sciences

notes



 it is important to note that when measuring mechanical energy an object is considered as a whole as it is stated by  in his    the motion of a whole is the same as the sum of the motions of the parts  that is the change in position of its parts from their places and thus the place of a whole is the same as the sum of the places of the parts and therefore is internal and in the whole body 
 in physics  is a scalar quantity and  is a  in other words velocity is speed with a direction and can therefore change without changing the speed of the object since speed is the numerical magnitude of a velocity
