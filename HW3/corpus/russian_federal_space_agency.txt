the  did not have central executive agencies instead its organizational architecture was multi-centered  it was the design bureaus and the council of designers that had the most say not the political leadership the creation of a central agency after the separation of russia from the  was therefore a new development russian space agency was formed on february 25 1992 by a decree of president   who had previously worked with designing mars landers at  became the agency s first director later renamed to roscosmos in the early years the agency suffered from lack of  as the powerful design bureaus fought to protect their own spheres of operation and to survive for example the decision to keep mir in operation beyond 1999 was not taken by the agency  instead it was made by the private shareholder board of the energia design bureau another example is that the decision to develop the new  was rather a function of  s ability to attract resources than a conscious long-term decision by the agency crisis years 
the 1990s saw serious financial problems because of decreased cash flow which encouraged roscosmos to improvise and seek other ways to keep space programs running this resulted in roscosmos  leading role in commercial satellite launches and  while scientific missions such as interplanetary probes or astronomy missions during these years played a very small role although roscosmos has connections with russian aerospace forces its budget is not part of the defense budget of the country roscosmos managed to operate the space station  well past its planned lifespan contribute to the  and continue to fly additional  and  missions in march 2004 director  was replaced by  who had previously served as the first commander of the space forces improved situation in 20052006 
the  boomed throughout 2005 from high prices for exports such as oil and gas the outlook for future funding in 2006 appeared more favorable this resulted in the russian duma approving a budget of 305 billion   about 11 billion usd  for the space agency from 2006 january to 2015 with overall space expenditures in russia total about 425 billion rubles for the same time period the budget for 2006 was as high as 25 billion rubles  about 900 million usd  which is a 33 increase from the 2005 budget under the current 10-year budget approved the budget of the space agency shall increase 510 per year providing the space agency with a constant influx of money in addition to the budget roscosmos plans to have over 130 billion rubles flowing into its budget by other means such as industry investments and commercial space launches it is around the time us-based  entered a partnership with roscosmos

the federal space budget for the year 2009 was left unchanged despite the global economic crisis standing at about 82 billion rubles  2.4 billion  in 2011 the government spent 115 billion rubles  3.8 bln  in the national space programs the proposed project core budget for 2013 to be around 128.3 billion rubles the budget for the whole space program is  169.8 billion rubles  5.6 bln  by 2015 the amount of the budget can be increased to 199.2 billion rubles priorities of the russian space program include the new  and development of new communications navigation and remote earth sensing spacecraft the  global navigation satellite system has for many years been one of the top priorities and has been given its own budget line in the federal space budget in 2007 glonass received 9.9 billion rubles  360 million  and under the terms of a  signed by  vladimir putin in 2008 an additional  2.6 billion will be allocated for its development space station funding issues 
due to  involvements up to 50 of russia s space budget is spent on the manned space program as of 2009 some observers have pointed out that this has a detrimental effect on other aspects of space exploration and that the other space powers spend much lesser proportions of their overall budgets on maintaining human presence in orbit despite the considerably improved budget  attention of legislative and executive authorities positive media coverage and broad support among the population the russian space program continues to face several problems wages in the space industry are low  the average age of employees is high  46 years in 2007  and much of the equipment is obsolete on the positive side many companies in the sector have been able to profit from contracts and partnerships with foreign companies  several new systems such as new rocket upper stages have been developed in recent years  investments have been made to production lines and companies have started to pay more attention to educating a new generation of engineers and technicians 2011  new director 
on 29 april 2011 perminov was replaced with  as the director of roscosmos the 65-year-old perminov was over the legal age for state officials and had received some criticism after a failed  launch in december 2010 popovkin is a former commander of the  and first deputy defense minister of russia 2013-2015 reorganization of the russian space sector 
as a result of a series of reliability problems and proximate to the failure of a july 2013  launch a major reorganization of the russian space industry was undertaken the  was formed as a  corporation by the  in august 2013 to consolidate the russian  sector deputy prime minister  said  the failure-prone space sector is so troubled that it needs state supervision to overcome its problems  three days following the proton m launch failure the russian government had announced that  extremely harsh measures  would be taken  and spell the end of the  space industry as we know it 
preliminary information indicated that the government intends to reorganize in such a way as to  preserve and enhance the  space agency 
more detailed plans released in october 2013 called for a  of the  troubled space industry  with sweeping reforms including a new  unified command structure and reducing redundant capabilities acts that could lead to tens of thousands of layoffs  according to rogozin the russian space sector employs about 250,000 people while the united states needs only 70,000 to achieve similar results he said   russian space productivity is eight times lower than americas with companies duplicating one anothers work and operating at about 40 percent efficiency 
under the 2013 plan roscosmos  will act as a federal executive body and contracting authority for programs to be implemented by the industry

rockets 
roscosmos is using a launch family of several rockets the most famous of them is the  commonly known as the  rocket capable of launching about 7.5 tons into   leo  the   or ur-500k  has a lift capacity of over 20 tons to leo smaller rockets include  the german-russian cooperation  and other stations currently rocket development encompasses both a new rocket system  as well as enhancements of the soyuz rocket  and  two modifications of the soyuz the soyuz-2.1a and soyuz-2.1b has already been successfully tested enhancing the launch capacity to 8.5 tons to leo new piloted spacecraft 
one of rka s projects that has made a large impact on the media in 2005 is  a small  reusable spacecraft while roscosmos has reached out to  and  as well as others to share development costs of the project it also has stated that it will go forward with the project even without support of other space agencies this statement was backed by the above-described approval of its budget for 20062015 which includes the necessary funding of  however the kliper program was cancelled in july 2006 and has been replaced by the new  project as of 2016 no craft were launched space systems
