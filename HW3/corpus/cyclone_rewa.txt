meteorological history 




track map of tropical cyclone rewa based on data from the joint typhoon warning center 

during 26 december the  started to monitor a  that had developed within the  about 575km  355mi  to the south-east of  over the next few days the depression gradually developed and organised further as it moved towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow during 28 december the jtwc classified the depression as tropical cyclone 05p before the fms named it rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale over the next few days the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest passing through the solomon islands on 29december and affecting the southeastern islands of  as it moved through the solomon islands rewa moved out of the  and into the  where the australian   bom  took the primary warning responsibility for the system on 30december the jtwc reported that rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the   sshs  early the next day the bom reported that the system had developed into a category 3severe tropical cyclone and an  became visible on satellite imagery the system then abruptly turned and started to move towards the south parallel to the queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure on 2january both the jtwc and the bom reported that rewa had reached its peak intensity with the jtwc reporting that rewa had peaked with  of 230km h  145mph  equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the sshws meanwhile the bom reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205km h  125mph  with a central pressure of 920   27.17  which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the australian scale rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24hours before the system started to weaken during 3january as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system throughout that day the cyclone started to move towards the south-east before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160e during 4january rewa moved back into the south pacific basin and continued eastward as a weakening category 3severe tropical cyclone with the fms estimating the 10-minute sustained windspeeds at 150km h  90mph  during the next day its eye became obscured after the mountains of new caledonia affected rewa s circulation by creating a hot and dry  the fms reported that the system had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone while the jtwc reported that rewa had become a tropical storm the system subsequently made landfall in the vicinity of  on new caledonia s south-western coast before it emerged near  from the east coast during 6 january by 7january rewa s circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north-westerlies  as a result both the fms and jtwc reported that rewa had weakened into a depression over the next 3 days the residual low-level circulation was steered towards the northwest and papua new guinea in a southeasterly  flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between new zealand and  during 10 january rewa s remnants moved out of the south pacific basin and back into the australian region while starting to re-intensify into a tropical cyclone as a mid to upper level trough over eastern australia increased in size as moved into the australian region rewa began to move in a long arc to the northwest and then to the north and on 13january both the jtwc and the  national weather service reported that the system had re-intensified into a tropical cyclone around papua new guinea s southern islands later that day rewa executed a sharp clockwise turn near  and started to move towards the southeast and the bom s area of responsibility while gradually intensifying further during 15january the bom reported that the system had re-intensified into a category 3severe tropical cyclone while the jtwc reported that rewa had become equivalent to a category 1hurricane again later that day the system started to rapidly intensify as an upper level trough approached the system during the next day the jtwc reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 230km h  145mph  the bom then reported later that day that rewa had peaked with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 205km h  125mph  which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale after it had peaked in intensity the system recurved towards the south-southwest and started to gradually weaken by 18january the jtwc reported that rewa had weakened into a tropical storm while throughout that day the bom assessed rewa as a category 3severe tropical cyclone during the next day the bom reported that rewa had weakened into a category 2tropical cyclone as it recurved and started to move towards the south-east about 265km  165mi  to the east of  over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south-southeast along the queensland coast while maintaining its intensity during 21january the bom and the jtwc reported that rewa had weakened below cyclone strength as the system moved back into the south pacific basin for the third and final time rewa s remnants were last noted late on 23january by new zealand s  bringing heavy rain to new zealand while dissipating over water about 400km  250mi  to the east of  preparations and impact 
twenty-two people lost their lives in accidents caused by cyclone rewa while it affected parts off the solomon islands papua new guinea australia new caledonia vanuatu and new zealand due to the impact of this storm the name rewa was  the solomon islands new caledonia vanuatu and new zealand 
the solomon islands were affected by the developing tropical cyclone between 28 30 december and was the first  to be impacted by rewa as it developed into a tropical cyclone on 28december the system passed to the north of the outer lying  of  in the solomon islands rewa then passed over the southern tip of  before passing to the south of  and the north of  during 29december cyclone rewa started to affect new caledonia on 5january before it passed over  island later that day rewa dumped over 300mm  12in  of rain on parts of the archipelago which made all of the major rivers overflow and burst their banks several landslides and a death were recorded within new caledonia while on the  of mare waves from rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at tadine s port the system had no effect on vanuatu while it passed through the solomon islands between 28 30december  however the southern islands of vanuatu were affected by the cyclone after it had passed through new caledonia during 5january as it moved towards the north-west between 68january rewa brought high seas and strong winds to parts of the island nation including the provinces of  and  some damage was recorded to port villa s harbours  as the system passed about 175km  110mi  to the southeast of the city between 1924 january rewa s remnants a slow moving  over  and a  brought widespread rainfall and flooding to new zealand s south island in  fiordland and the  landslides and flooding occurred on 21 january while several roads and bridges were damaged papua new guinea 
cyclone rewa affected papua new guinea on two separate occasions while it was active with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28december and 1january before grazing the archipelago between 12-14january before rewa affected the country cyclone  were issued for  rossel and samarai islands while authorities urged people not to go to beaches as it affected the archipelago rewa brought heavy rainfall high seas and wind gusts of up to 100km h  60mph  to parts of the archipelago including sudest rossel and samarai islands the hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems with the cyclone blocking roads destroying a church bridges homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and  destroyed in total cyclone rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths 8 of which were due to flooding nine other people went missing while travelling to rossel island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with rewa they were later presumed dead by the national disaster and emergency service after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat at 00 00utc on 30december the automatic weather station at  on rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km h  35mph  australia 
during the opening days of 1994 rewa moved southwards parallel to the queensland coast  however because it was located about 600km  370mi  to the north-east of mackay it was too far away from the coast for there to be any direct impact on queensland the only indirect impact was higher surf from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards new caledonia during 4january as rewa affected queensland for the second time watches and warnings were issued for various parts of queensland by tcwc brisbane who predicted a landfall near mackay on 18 january local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about rewa by a helicopter a military training exercise that was due to take place in  had to be cancelled with army personal evacuated to  to avoid being cut off by flood waters along the coast several ports including  were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm on 19january rewa started to affect queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast however it did not make its predicted landfall near mackay instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100km  60mi  of the coast two men off  s coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army  helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler s propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone s path the worst affected island was  as it bore the brunt of the wind while on  several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged as rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19january heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of brisbane and the gold coast brisbane received over 144mm  5.7in  in just six hours which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars while the other death occurred when a person went surfing brisbane s flood water and got trapped in a storm drain within brisbane 100homes and 20cars were damaged by the flood waters while a   match between western australia and queensland was delayed after  resembled a small lake see also
