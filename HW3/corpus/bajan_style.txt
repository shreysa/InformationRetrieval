reception
the album received generally positive reviews from music critics becca longmire of entertainmentwise applauded the album describing it as a  job well done  she continued saying  amanda has a pretty rare quality in the fact that she has the ability to flip from a ballad such as their chart topper  twilight  to a slightly sassier  rihanna style  track such as debut single  lick ya down  the tracks that stand out the most have to be title track  bajan style   which definitely shows off the band s barbados roots and another slightly more upbeat track  headphones  which emphasises the band s musical ability and raw talent with lyrics such as  boy i want to put you on repeat you will be the bass of my heartbeat  it s easy to compare amanda to fellow bajan beauty rihanna  however this band definitely have their own sound and the album has some sure fire catchy hits 
krystal scanlon of  gave the album a positive review commenting  cover drives first three singles have already scored barbadian band huge hit singles so it was obvious the band have already got their career off to a good start  she continued saying  the opening track  bajan style intro  is just a perfect taster of what the album has to offer with a hint of an early  tone to some of their songs this album offers its listeners a variety of solid beats catchy lyrics and an overall good feeling the background beat of  headphones  holds a similar style of tune to  s    so if youre a fan of the lovely  this is definitely worth a try  lick ya down  rivals rihanna for the radio-friendly sounds heard on her recent album but that said cover drive still have their own unique style and this song is equally catchy just like the rest of this album with their front girl amanda being labeled the new bajan queen of the music scene rihanna is definitely going to have a little competition on her hands in the charts  wrongside  is another standout tune and has a vibe similar to s   with the backing rhythm while a lot of these songs do have a catchy beat and could be considered similar its safe to say there is still a lot of variety amongst the songs  from calmer slow songs to upbeat songs that make you want to dance cover drive are definitely some way from their pop peak on this their first album but theres no doubt that this is going to set the bar high itll be interesting to see what song they release next because they certainly have a good set to choose from 
lewis corner of  awarded the album three out of five stars commenting  from the off it s clear the group have been influenced by other mixed quartets no doubt and the black eyed peas as such singer amanda reifer serves as the  gwen stefani and takes the lead on the majority of the tracks she can flip from butter-wouldn t-melt on mid-tempo love song  twilight  to passionate and sassy on debut single  lick ya down  in an instant  and she pulls it off with ease however it s  headphones  that showcases the band s real ability as musicians  boy i want to put you on repeat  you will be the bass of my heartbeat  amanda swoons over bouncy beats and funk-driven guitar riffs packed with more tropical flavour and sweetness than an ice-cold can of lilt  sparks  proves they are more than capable of taking on the trickier ballads producing an ear-snagging pop melody with a floating piano riff and radio-friendly vocals penultimate cut  hurricane  injects a welcome burst of back-end energy after non-starters  wrongside  and  can t live in a world  begin to pull things down like all good cricket matches there may be quiet spells during the game but it s only the final result that really matters luckily for cover drive their very first innings contains some very memorable hits 
alex macpherson of  awarded the album three out of five stars saying  the summer dancehall hit once an annual staple of the british charts has been on a hiatus in recent years  as bajan four-piece cover drive have spotted their compatriot rihanna may have long abandoned reggae-lite pop for foghorn electro but her early years provide fertile inspiration for cover drive from the steel pans and airhorns of breakthrough hit  lick ya down  to the fluttering yearning  explode  lead singer amanda reifer could be mistaken for rihanna albeit a less charismatic version  a quality that also explains why cover drive s breezy beach party-vibes are highly likable but a bit lightweight still in an era when most pop stars  strategy is to bludgeon you into submission that s refreshing
