weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the  for a given location and time human beings have attempted to predict the  informally for  and formally since the  weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative  about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using  to project how the atmosphere will change once a human-only endeavor based mainly upon changes in  current weather conditions and sky condition weather forecasting now relies on  that take many atmospheric factors into account human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon which involves pattern recognition skills  knowledge of model performance and knowledge of model biases the inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the  nature of the atmosphere the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere the error involved in measuring the initial conditions and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes hence forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made  the range of the forecast  increases the use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome there are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property forecasts based on  and  are important to  and therefore to traders within commodity markets temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days on an everyday basis people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and  forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead and survive them in 2014 the us spent  5.1 billion on weather forecasting

history
for millennia people have tried to forecast the weather in 650bc the  predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as  in about 350bc  described weather patterns in  later  compiled a book on weather forecasting called the book of signs  weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 300bc which was also around the same time ancient  developed weather-prediction methods in new testament times christ himself referred to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns by saying  when evening comes you say  it will be fair weather for the sky is red  and in the morning  today it will be stormy for the sky is red and overcast  you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times 
in 904ad  s nabatean agriculture discussed the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations  signs of rain based on observation of the   and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events also termed pattern recognition for example it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red the following day often brought fair weather this experience accumulated over the generations to produce  however not all  of these predictions prove reliable and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing modern methods 




the royal charter sank in an 1859 storm stimulating the establishment of modern weather forecasting 

it was not until the invention of the  in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began before that the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day  160km d  but was more typically 4075 miles per day  60120km day   whether by land or by sea  by the late 1840s the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further  the two men credited with the birth of forecasting as a science were officer of the   and his   both were influential men in  naval and governmental circles and though ridiculed in the press at the time their work gained scientific credence was accepted by the  and formed the basis for all of today s weather forecasting knowledge beaufort developed the  and weather notation coding which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life he also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around british shores and with his friend  expanded weather record-keeping at 200 british  stations robert fitzroy was appointed in 1854 as chief of a new department within the  to deal with the collection of weather data at sea as a service to  this was the forerunner of the modern  all ship captains were tasked with collating data on the weather and computing it with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose

a storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the  inspired fitzroy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made which he called  forecasting the weather  thus coining the term  weather forecast  fifteen land stations were established to use the new  to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale warning service his warning service for shipping was initiated in february 1861 with the use of  the first daily weather forecasts were published in  in 1861 in the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected the  weather book  which fitzroy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time as the electric telegraph network expanded allowing for the more rapid dissemination of warnings a national observational network was developed which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using  were supplied to the observing stations from   these cameras had been invented by  in 1845 and his  had earlier been used by fitzroy to convey accurate information it soon became necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds  this was achieved by means of a series of classifications first achieved by  in 1802 and standardized in the  of 1896 numerical prediction

it was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern  in 1922 english scientist  published  weather prediction by numerical process  after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in world war i he described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others however the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems it was later found through numerical analysis that this was due to  the first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of american meteorologists  philip thompson larry gates and norwegian meteorologist  applied mathematician  and  programmer  practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955 spurred by the development of programmable electronic  broadcasts 




  above  presented the first in-vision forecast on january 11 1954 for the bbc 

the first ever daily weather forecasts were published in  on august 1 1861 and the first  were produced later in the same year in 1911 the  began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission these included gale and storm warnings for areas around great britain in the united states the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by edward b  e.b  rideout on  the edison electric illuminating station in boston rideout came from the  as did  weather forecaster g harold noyes in 1931 the world s first  weather forecasts including the use of weather maps were experimentally broadcast by the  in 1936 this was brought into practice in 1949 after   gave the first weather forecast while being televised in front of the map in 1954 in america experimental television forecasts were made by james c fidler in cincinnati in either 1940 or 1947 on the  in the late 1970s and early 80s  the first weatherman on abc-tv s  pioneered the use of on-screen  information and  for television forecasts coleman was a co-founder of   twc  in 1982 twc is now a 24-hour cable network some weather channels have started broadcasting on  such as  and  to reach more viewers one meteorologist jeff matthews transformed the medium from forecasting live during television broadcasts to forecasting live on periscope under the name of   becoming the first meteorologist to deliver daily forecasts on a life-streaming application...and thus making weather forecasting interactive for the public how models create forecasts

the basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of  and  to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future the main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated  at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea the  acts to standardize the instrumentation observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide stations either report hourly in  reports or every six hours in  reports sites launch  which rise through the depth of the  and well into the  data from  are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available compared with similar data from radiosondes the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage however at a lower accuracy and resolution  provide information on precipitation location and intensity which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time additionally if a   is used then wind speed and direction can be determined

commerce provides  along aircraft routes and ship reports along shipping routes research flights using  fly in and around weather systems of interest such as  reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems that cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance or are expected to be of high impact 37 days into the future over the downstream continent models are initialized using this observed data the irregularly spaced observations are processed by  and objective analysis methods which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model s mathematical algorithms  usually an evenly spaced grid  the data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast commonly the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called  these equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined the rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future the equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future this time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time the length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid the length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid and is chosen to maintain  time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes the global models are run at varying times into the future the  s  is run six days into the future the  model is run out to 10days into the future while the  model run by the  is run 16days into the future the visual output produced by a model solution is known as a  or prog the raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast this can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known  in the model or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts mos or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site-specific guidance this guidance is presented in coded numerical form and can be obtained for nearly all national weather service reporting stations in the united states as proposed by  in 1963 long range forecasts those made at a range of two weeks or more are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere owing to the  of the  equations involved in numerical models extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity essentially a model is a computer program that produces  information for future times at given locations and altitudes within any modern model is a set of equations known as the primitive equations used to predict the future state of the atmosphere these equationsalong with the are used to evolve the   and   and the   of the atmosphere through time additional transport equations for pollutants and other  are included in some primitive-equation mesoscale models as well the equations used are  partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods with the exception of a few idealized cases therefore numerical methods obtain approximate solutions different models use different solution methods  some global models use  for the horizontal dimensions and  for the vertical dimension while regional models and other global models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions techniques
the simplest method of forecasting the weather persistence relies upon today s conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow this can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state such as during the summer season in the tropics this method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern therefore when in a fluctuating weather pattern this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate it can be useful in both short range forecasts and  use of a barometer 
measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency  the change of pressure over time  have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century the larger the change in pressure especially if more than 3.5  2.6  the larger the change in weather can be expected if the pressure drop is rapid a  is approaching and there is a greater chance of rain  are associated with improving weather conditions such as clearing skies looking at the sky

along with pressure tendency the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future at night high thin  can lead to  around the  which indicates an approach of a  and its associated  morning  portends fair conditions as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation the approach of a line of  could indicate the approach of a  cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future a  can indicate a coming tropical cyclone the use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various  over the centuries nowcasting 
main article  
the forecasting of the weather within the next six hours is often referred to as nowcasting in this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model a human given the latest radar satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours however there are now  using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation including evolution of those features in time use of forecast models

in the past the human forecaster was responsible for generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations today human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters such as model biases and performance using a consensus of forecast models as well as ensemble members of the various models can help reduce forecast error however regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast while increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans may no longer be needed in the forecast process at some point in the future there is currently still a need for human intervention analog technique 
the analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event that is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event what makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition it remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future a similar technique is used in medium range forecasting which is known as teleconnections when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime an example of teleconnections are by using   enso  related phenomena quality assessment 

mathematical models are often developed to map the  of a weather prediction methodology communicating forecasts to the public 


an example of a two-day weather forecast in the  that an american newspaper might use temperatures are given in fahrenheit 

most end users of forecasts are members of the general public thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous  strikes that can lead to deaths power outages and widespread hail damage heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas excessive  or  can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities and  can impact water usage and destroy vegetation several countries employ government agencies to provide forecasts and watches warnings advisories to the public in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must be taken into account to present the information in a useful and understandable way examples include the  s   nws  and  s   msc  traditionally newspaper television and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public increasingly the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found in all cases these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis severe weather alerts and advisories 
a major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected this is done to protect life and property some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the  and  as well as the  and  other forms of these advisories include winter weather high wind   and fog severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media including radio using emergency systems as the  which break into regular programming low temperature forecast 
the low temperature forecast for the current day is calculated using the lowest temperature found between 7pm that evening through 7am the following morning so in short today s forecasted low is most likely tomorrow s low temperature specialist forecasting 
there are a number of sectors with their own specific needs for weather forecasts and specialist services are provided to these users air traffic
