a zone 50 m wide extending from the island of ceylon and the coromandel coast to the head of the bay and thence southwards through a strip embracing the andaman and nicobar islands is bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom  some 50 m beyond this lies the 500-fathom limit opposite the mouth of the ganges however the intervals between these depths are very much extended by deltaic influence  is a 14km-wide deep sea canyon of the bay of bengal the deepest recorded area of this valley is about 1340 m the submarine canyon is part of the  the largest submarine fan in the world marine biology flora and fauna

the  a layer of air pollution that covers much of south asia and the indian ocean every year between january and march and possibly also during earlier and later months hangs over the bay of bengal it is considered to be a combination of vehicle exhaust smoke from cooking fires and industrial discharges transboundary issues affecting the marine ecosystem 

a transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem and or its impact is separated by a national boundary  or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit the eight bay of bengal countries have  2012  identified three major transboundary problems  or areas of concern  affecting the health of the bay that they can work on together with the support of the   boblme  the eight countries are now  2012  developing responses to these issues and their causes for future implementation as the strategic action programme overexploitation of fisheries 




some small fishing boats are catching fish   sell them in local coastal markets


 production in the bay of bengal is six million tonnes per year more than seven percent of the world s catch the major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are  a decline in the overall availability of fish resources  changes in species composition of catches  the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch  and changes in  especially through loss of vulnerable and  the transboundary nature of these issues are  that many  are shared between boblme countries through the transboundary migration of  or   overlaps national jurisdictions both legally and illegally overcapacity and  in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations all countries  to a greater or lesser degree  are experiencing difficulties in implementing  especially the  bay of bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of  and  the main causes of the issues are  open access to fishing grounds  government emphasis on increasing fish catches  inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers  increasing fishing effort especially from  and   high consumer demand for fish including for seed and  for   ineffective fisheries management  and illegal and destructive fishing degradation of critical habitats 
the bay of bengal is an area of high biodiversity with many  and  the major transboundary issues relating to habitats are  the loss and degradation of     and the loss of and damage to  the transboundary nature of these major issues are  that all three critical habitats occur in all boblme countries  for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all boblme countries trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature  impacts are shared by all boblme countries the main causes of the issues are   needs of the coastal poor  lack of   increasing trade in products from coastal habitats  coastal development and industrialization  ineffective  and lack of enforcement  upstream development that affects water-flow    and increasing tourism pollution and water quality 
the major transboundary issues relating to  and  are  sewage-borne pathogens and organic load  solid waste marine litter  increasing nutrient inputs  oil pollution  persistent organic pollutants   and persistent toxic substances  ptss  sedimentation  and heavy metals the transboundary nature of these issues are  discharge of untreated partially treated  being a common problem sewage and organic discharges from the  river are likely to be transboundary plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries high nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries  are transported long distances pops ptss and  including organo-mercury undergo long-range transport  and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension the main causes of the issues are  increasing coastal population density and urbanization  higher consumption resulting in more waste generated per person  insufficient funds allocated to waste management  migration of industry into boblme countries  and proliferation of small industries history
