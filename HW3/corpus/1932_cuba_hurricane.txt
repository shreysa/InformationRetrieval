the british vessel s.s phemius which followed the progress of the hurricane from november5-7 and documented the storm s lowest measured pressure


as the hurricane moved slowly through the eastern and southern caribbean the rough seas and strong winds disrupted shipping routes on november6 the american  abundance encountered the storm east of  resulting in a destroyed  and a beaching on jamaica s  however the ship s six crew were extracted from the disabled vessel and were transported to the united states although the s.s phemius would later return safely to port in cuba reports that the ship had lost its smokestack and the relaying of an  message prompted the  liner tela to search for the initially missing ship which failed due to poor visibility conditions this was followed by a search operation undertaken by the  and  on november8 the s.s phemius was found damaged and later towed to shore by a salvage tug however during the same period of time both the steamer tacira and the freighter san simeon were disabled after encountering the storm requiring towing to safety several other ships in the immediate area were also hampered by the storm some damage was reported in northern south america as the hurricane swept near the coast in colombia rail telecommunications were interrupted near  and banana plantations in the area were believed to have suffered to some extent due to the storm s winds and rain in santa marta itself several homes were inundated and automotive traffic was hampered by the storm s effects docks on santa marta s port were also damaged heavy rains also washed out some railways and bridges further disrupting the distribution of banana shipments elsewhere along the coast many of colombia s seaports were damaged by the storm s effects while inland farms suffered extensive flood damage due to sparse reports from the remainder of colombia the extent of damage in  remains unspecified with other nearby towns reporting  heavy  damage the village of  was almost entirely destroyed  just off of colombia sustained significant agricultural damage and the loss of 36homes to the northeast in  the passing hurricane destroyed the island harbor s fortifications a seawall near the entrance to  suffered partial collapse while a  linking both sides of the harbor was completely destroyed in nearby  a pier succumbed to the driving rain and rough seas with the hurricane threatening jamaica  cancelled its flights servicing  in jamaica the storm s passage to the west caused intense winds as strong as 71mph  114km h  to sweep across the island destroying over 2million trees although effects overall were generally minimal some localized areas on the island experienced as much as a 50%loss of banana trees due to the storm the cost of damage on jamaica was 4million cayman islands 
the storm devastated the  especially  which was inundated by the  which was reported to be as high as 10m  33ft  many homes and buildings were washed out to sea as a result of the storm and many people had to climb trees to escape the floodwaters 110people died on the islands  one of them was on  and the rest were on cayman brac the ship balboa also sank as a result of the storm cuba 




santa cruz del sur camagey province cuba after the hurricane


although no warnings were issued initially the national observatory of cuba voiced concerns that the intense tropical cyclone presented a danger to cuba particularly camagey province as early as november5 however the observatory indicated that forecasting the future motion of the hurricane was difficult as the storm s intensity and previous motion was not consistent with climatology on november8 a  was issued for the southeastern extent of cuba as a precautionary measure shipping routes servicing ports in eastern cuba were suspended the town of  in  was virtually obliterated by a massive  which measured 6.5m  21.3ft  in height few buildings remained standing in the area in that coastal town alone a total of 2,870people lost their lives in total 3,033people died in cuba and damage there was estimated at  40million  1932    702.1 million today
