the ligurian sea


a genoa low  also known as genoa cyclogenesis ligurian depression or v 5track cyclone  is a cyclone that forms or intensifies from a pre-existing cyclone to the south of the  over the    and northern  vb cyclones are rare events which occur on average only 2.3 times per year

the northwestern mediterranean and the gulf of genoa in particular are not only a transition area for passing cyclones but are frequently areas of cyclogenesis low pressure areas move into or are formed as a result of north atlantic air entering the mediterranean sea between the alps and the  via the  or via the  gap between the  and massif central this cold and moist air enters the mediterranean basin and is deflected by the high mountains of northwest  which divert the air mass to the northeast triggering cool and wet  winds in response into to the  which in turn hit the western  located in the immediate vicinity of the sea several factors that have special relevance in the development of depressions south of the alps are 

the thermal contrast between land and sea interaction between the polar front jet stream and the subtropical jet stream effect of northerly flow over the alps enhancing cyclogenetic activity along the southern slopes effect of the concave curvature of the southern slopes of the alps enhancing cyclonic formation 
a complex interaction is established between the  of liguria and the contrast between the cold and humid air mass and the warmer water of the ligurian sea the process ends with the formation of a low pressure area over the ligurian sea just near the city of  genoa low cyclogenesis can occur at any time of year though usually situated further south during the summer cyclogenesis is shifted to the east depending on the amount of cold air entering the po valley and generally shifts to the  when little enters the valley effects on climate 
the depressions bear rain often intense on the ligurian coast and hills of  due to  which affects the southern side of the apennines the area of low pressure is slow moving and may follow a trajectory from west to east then going on to affect the regions of the adriatic or move from the north-west to south-east down along the   in this last case the structure will reach the same cyclonic area of formation of tyrrhenian depressions although not related to the latter van bebber cyclone tracks 




map of cyclone tracks over europe showing divergence of track v over the ligurian sea and north adriatic


most genoa lows remain stationary or leave a residual trough to the south of the alps three principal tracks which they typically follow were identified by wilhelm jakob van bebber who classified  tracks  zyklonenbahnen  in german  in 1891 to this date track v of the latter group has remained in common use unlike the large majority of van bebber s tracks the v track is linked to flooding events in central and eastern europe low pressure areas  south of the alps  can track across france into the mediterranean sea where they pick up additional moisture or form and then move into central and eastern or southern europe the tracks diverge from the genoa low formation area along the following pathways vb track 
a strong southwesterly flow in the upper atmosphere leads the lows to the northeast and northnortheast  zugstrasse vb  van bebber  towards the  the lows then glide over colder and denser air from the northwest and are lifted orographically by the     and  the warm and moist air masses cause prolonged and abundant precipitation during slow  over the upper catchments of both the southern and northern  flooding then progresses down their major rivers of central europe this  vb-track  displays a high potential for large summer floods in europe although the link between large summer floods and the vb track have also been described as having a significant but weak correlation examples of flooding events which follow this pattern are

vc track 
the vc track draws the lows across the  towards the  and on towards western  and  vd track 
if there is a strong anticyclone over the  turkey and the  the usual track of the low is southeasterly skirting the northern coast of the mediterranean sea it is this track that moves the low across the tyrrhenian sea even after the primary low has moved out of the tyrrhenian sea-central mediterranean area if a residual trough remains south of the alps as is often the case new centers can develop and occasionally move southeastward along the west coast of italy it is also common that a genoa low that has moved to the southwest will stall and become stationary just to the west of the foot of the italian boot and this often will be associated with new low centers developing to the east over the  in this case gale force  are typically generated by the time the depression moves into the ionian sea references
