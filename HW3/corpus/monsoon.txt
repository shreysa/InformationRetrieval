monsoon   is traditionally defined as a seasonal reversing  accompanied by corresponding changes in  but is now used to describe seasonal changes in  circulation and precipitation associated with the asymmetric heating of land and sea usually the term monsoon is used to refer to the  of a seasonally changing pattern although technically there is also a dry phase the term is sometimes incorrectly used for locally heavy but short-term rains although these rains meet the dictionary definition of monsoon the major monsoon systems of the world consist of the  and  monsoons the inclusion of the  and  monsoons with incomplete wind reversal has been debated the term was first used in english in   now   and   and neighbouring countries to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing from the  and  in the southwest bringing heavy  to the area

monsoon clouds over  


the english monsoon came from portuguese mono ultimately from  mawsim    season  and or   mausam   perhaps partly via early modern dutch monsun  history
strengthening of the asian monsoon has been linked to the uplift of the  after the collision of the  and asia around 50 million years ago because of studies of records from the  and that of the wind-blown dust in the  of  many geologists believe the monsoon first became strong around 8 million years ago more recently studies of plant fossils in china and new long-duration  records from the  led to a timing of the monsoon beginning 1520 million years ago and linked to early tibetan uplift testing of this hypothesis awaits deep ocean sampling by the  the monsoon has varied significantly in strength since this time largely linked to global climate change especially the cycle of the  ice ages a study of marine plankton suggested that the indian monsoon strengthened around 5 million years ago then during ice periods the sea level fell and the  closed when this happened cold waters in the pacific were impeded from flowing into the indian ocean it is believed that the resulting increase in sea surface temperatures in the indian ocean increased the intensity of monsoons five episodes during the  at 2.22   pl-1  1.83 ma  pl-2  0.68 ma  pl-3  0.45 ma  pl-4  and 0.04 ma  pl-5  were identified which showed a weakening of  the weakening of the lc would have an effect on the  in the indian ocean as the indonesian through flow generally warms the indian ocean thus these five intervals could probably be those of considerable lowering of sst in the indian ocean and would have influenced indian monsoon intensity during the weak lc there is the possibility of reduced intensity of the indian winter monsoon and strong summer monsoon because of change in the indian ocean dipole due to reduction in net heat input to the indian ocean through the indonesian through flow thus a better understanding of the possible links between  western pacific warm pool  wind pattern off western australia and ice volume expansion and contraction can be obtained by studying the behaviour of the lc during quaternary at close stratigraphic intervals strength of impact

this visualization shows the asian monsoon and how it develops using observational and modeled data it also shows some of the impacts 

the impact of monsoon on the local weather is different from place to place in some places there is just a likelihood of having a little more or less rain in other places quasi semi-deserts are turned into vivid green grasslands where all sorts of plants and crops can flourish the indian monsoon turns large parts of india from a kind of semi-desert into green lands see photos only taken 3 months apart in the western ghats in places like this it is crucial for farmers to have the right timing for putting the seeds on the fields as it is essential to use all the rain that is available for growing crops process
monsoons are large-scale   which occur when the temperature on land is significantly warmer or cooler than the temperature of the ocean these temperature imbalances happen because oceans and land absorb heat in different ways over oceans the air temperature remains relatively stable for two reasons  water has a relatively high   3.9 to 4.2 j g1 k1  and because both  and  will equilibrate a hot or cold surface with deeper water  up to 50 metres  in contrast dirt sand and rocks have lower heat capacities  0.19 to 0.35 j g1 k1  and they can only transmit heat into the earth by conduction and not by convection therefore bodies of water stay at a more even temperature while land temperature are more variable during warmer months sunlight heats the surfaces of both land and oceans but land temperatures rise more quickly as the land s surface becomes warmer the air above it expands and an area of  develops meanwhile the ocean remains at a lower temperature than the land and the air above it retains a higher pressure this difference in pressure causes  to blow from the ocean to the land bringing moist air inland this moist air rises to a higher altitude over land and then it flows back toward the ocean  thus completing the cycle  however when the air rises and while it is still over the land the air  this decreases the air s  and this causes  over the land this is why summer monsoons cause so much rain over land in the colder months the cycle is reversed then the land cools faster than the oceans and the air over the land has higher pressure than air over the ocean this causes the air over the land to flow to the ocean when humid air rises over the ocean it cools and this causes precipitation over the oceans  the cool air then flows towards the land to complete the cycle 
most summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain  because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air  the intensity and duration however are not uniform from year to year winter monsoons by contrast have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge subside and cause drought similar  is caused when moist ocean air is lifted upwards by mountains surface heating convergence at the surface divergence aloft or from storm-produced outflows at the surface however the lifting occurs the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure and this produces  global monsoon

onset dates and prevailing wind currents of the southwest summer monsoons in india


the southwestern summer monsoons occur from july through september the  and adjoining areas of the northern and central indian subcontinent heat up considerably during the hot summers this causes a low pressure area over the northern and central indian subcontinent to fill this void the moisture-laden winds from the  rush into the subcontinent these winds rich in moisture are drawn towards the  the himalayas act like a high wall blocking the winds from passing into  and forcing them to rise as the clouds rise their  drops and precipitation occurs some areas of the subcontinent receive up to 10,000mm  390in  of rain annually the southwest monsoon is generally expected to begin around the beginning of june and fade away by the end of september the moisture-laden winds on reaching the southernmost point of the  due to its topography become divided into two parts  the arabian sea branch and the bay of bengal branch the arabian sea branch of the southwest monsoon first hits the  of the coastal state of  thus making this area the first state in india to receive rain from the southwest monsoon this branch of the monsoon moves northwards along the    and   with precipitation on coastal areas west of the western ghats the eastern areas of the western ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the western ghats the bay of bengal branch of southwest monsoon flows over the  heading towards  and  picking up more moisture from the bay of bengal the winds arrive at the  with large amounts of rain  situated on the southern slopes of the khasi hills in  is one of the wettest places on earth after the arrival at the eastern himalayas the winds turns towards the  travelling over the  at a rate of roughly 12 weeks per state  pouring rain all along its way june 1 is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon in india as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state of kerala the monsoon accounts for 80 of the rainfall in india  indian agriculture  which accounts for 25 of the gdp and employs 70 of the population  is heavily dependent on the rains for growing crops especially like    and coarse grains a delay of a few days in the arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy as evidenced in the numerous droughts in india in the 1990s the monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by city-dwellers as well for it provides relief from the climax of summer heat in june however the roads take a battering every year often houses and streets are waterlogged and  are flooded despite drainage systems a lack of city infrastructure coupled with changing climate patterns causes severe economic loss including damage to property and loss of lives as evidenced in the  that brought the city to a standstill  and certain regions of india like  and  also frequently experience heavy  during this season recently areas in india that used to receive scanty rainfall throughout the year like the  have surprisingly ended up receiving floods due to the prolonged monsoon season the influence of the southwest monsoon is felt as far north as in china s  it is estimated that about 70 of all precipitation in the central part of the  falls during the three summer months when the region is under the monsoon influence  about 70 of that is directly of  cyclonic   i.e monsoon-driven  origin  as opposed to   northeast monsoon

around september with the sun fast retreating south the northern land mass of the indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly with this air pressure begins to build over northern india the indian ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still holds its heat this causes cold wind to sweep down from the  and  towards the vast spans of the indian ocean south of the  peninsula this is known as the northeast monsoon or retreating monsoon while travelling towards the indian ocean the dry cold wind picks up some moisture from the  and pours it over peninsular india and parts of  cities like  which get less rain from the southwest monsoon receive rain from this monsoon about 50 to 60 of the rain received by the state of  is from the northeast monsoon in southern  the northeastern monsoons take place from december to early march when the surface  is strongest the  in this region splits into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet the subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern asia creating dry  which produce clear skies over india meanwhile a low pressure system develops over  and  and winds are directed toward  known as a  east asian monsoon
main article  
the east asian monsoon affects large parts of      and  it is characterised by a warm rainy summer monsoon and a cold dry winter monsoon the rain occurs in a concentrated belt that stretches east-west except in east china where it is tilted east-northeast over korea and japan the seasonal rain is known as meiyu in china jangma in korea and bai-u in japan with the latter two resembling frontal rain the onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over south china and taiwan in early may from may through august the summer monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves northward beginning over  and the   may  to the  and japan  june  and finally to  and korea  july  when the monsoon ends in august the rain belt moves back to  australia

also known as the indo-australian monsoon the rainy season occurs from september to february and it is a major source of energy for the hadley circulation during boreal winter the maritime continent monsoon and the australian monsoon may be considered to be the same system the indo-australian monsoon it is associated with the development of the  and the movement of the heating maxima from the  to the  north-easterly winds flow down  are turned north-westerly westerly by  topography towards  this forms a cyclonic circulation vortex over borneo which together with descending cold surges of winter air from higher latitudes cause significant weather phenomena in the region examples are the formation of a rare low-latitude tropical storm in 2001  and the  in 2007 the onset of the monsoon over the maritime continent tends to follow the heating maxima down  and the   september  to   and the   october  to    november   and   december january  however the monsoon is not a simple response to heating but a more complex interaction of topography wind and sea as demonstrated by its abrupt rather than gradual withdrawal from the region the australian monsoon  the  wet  occurs in the southern summer when the monsoon trough develops over northern australia over three-quarters of annual rainfall in northern australia falls during this time europe

the european monsoon  more commonly known as the return of the westerlies  is the result of a resurgence of westerly winds from the  where they become loaded with wind and rain these westerly winds are a common phenomenon during the european winter but they ease as spring approaches in late march and through april and may the winds pick up again in june which is why this phenomenon is also referred to as  the return of the westerlies  the rain usually arrives in two waves at the beginning of june and again in mid to late june the european monsoon is not a monsoon in the traditional sense in that it doesn t meet all the requirements to be classified as such instead the return of the westerlies is more regarded as a conveyor belt that delivers a series of low pressure centres to  where they create unsettled weather these storms generally feature significantly lower than average temperatures fierce rain or hail thunder and strong winds the return of the westerlies affects europe s  coastline more precisely   the    and parts of  see also
