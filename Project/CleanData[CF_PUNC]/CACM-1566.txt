optimal starting values for newton-raphson calculation of sqrtx the problem of obtaining starting values for the newton-raphson calculation of sqrtx on a digital computer is considered it is shown that the conventionally used best uniform approximations to sqrtx do not provide optimal starting values the problem of obtaining optimal starting values the problem of obtaining optimal starting values is stated and several basic results are proved a table of optimal polynomial starting values is given cacm July, 1967 Moursund, D.
