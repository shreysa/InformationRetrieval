salinity is the saltiness or amount of  dissolved in a body of   see also   this is usually measured in   note that this is technically dimensionless  salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the  of natural waters and of  processes within it and is a  that along with  and  governs physical characteristics like the  and  of the water a  of constant salinity is called an isohaline or sometimes isohale

definitions 
salinity in rivers lakes and the ocean is conceptually simple but technically challenging to define and measure precisely conceptually the salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water salts are compounds like    and  which dissolve into ions the concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity operationally dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter  historically a filter with a pore size of 0.45 m but nowadays usually 0.2 m  salinity can be expressed in the form of a  i.e the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution seawater typically has a mass salinity of around 35g kg although lower values are typical near coasts where rivers enter the ocean rivers and lakes can have a wide range of salinities from less than 0.01g kg to a few g kg although there are many places where higher salinities are found the  has a salinity of more than 200g kg whatever pore size is used in the definition the resulting salinity value of a given sample of natural water will not vary by more than a few     physical oceanographers working in the  however are often concerned with precision and intercomparability of measurements by different researchers at different times to almost five significant digits a bottled seawater product known as iapso standard seawater is used by oceanographers to standardize their measurements with enough precision to meet this requirement composition 
measurement and definition difficulties arise because natural waters contain a complex mixture of many different elements from different sources  not all from dissolved salts  in different molecular forms the chemical properties of some of these forms depend on temperature and pressure many of these forms are difficult to measure with high accuracy and in any case complete chemical analysis is not practical when analyzing multiple samples different practical definitions of salinity result from different attempts to account for these problems to different levels of precision while still remaining reasonably easy to use for practical reasons salinity is usually related to the sum of masses of a subset of these dissolved chemical constituents  so-called solution salinity  rather than to the unknown mass of salts that gave rise to this composition  an exception is when  is created  for many purposes this sum can be limited to a set of eight major ions in natural waters although for seawater at highest precision an additional seven minor ions are also included the major ions dominate the inorganic composition of most  but by no means all  natural waters exceptions include some  and waters from some  the concentrations of dissolved gases like  and  are not usually included in descriptions of salinity however  gas which when dissolved is partially converted into  and  is often included  in the form of  which usually appears as a neutral molecule in the  range of most natural waters may also be included for some purposes  e.g when salinity density relationships are being investigated  seawater

the term  salinity  is for oceanographers usually associated with one of a set of specific measurement techniques as the dominant techniques evolve so do different descriptions of salinity the distinctions between these different descriptions are important to physical oceanographers but are obscure and confusing to nonspecialists salinities were largely measured usingbased techniques before the 1980s titration with  could be used to determine the concentration of  ions  mainly  and   to give a  the chlorinity was then multiplied by a factor to account for all other constituents the resulting  knudsen salinities  are expressed in units of parts per thousand  ppt or   the use of  measurements to estimate the ionic content of seawater led to the development of the scale called the practical salinity scale 1978  pss-78  salinities measured using pss-78 do not have units the suffix psu or psu  denoting practical salinity unit  is sometimes added to pss-78 measurement values in 2010 a new standard for the properties of seawater called the thermodynamic equation of seawater 2010  teos-10  was introduced advocating absolute salinity as a replacement for practical salinity and  as a replacement for  this standard includes a new scale called the reference composition salinity scale absolute salinities on this scale are expressed as a mass fraction in grams per kilogram of solution salinities on this scale are determined by combining electrical conductivity measurements with other information that can account for regional changes in the composition of seawater they can also be determined by making direct density measurements a sample of seawater from most locations with a chlorinity of 19.37ppt will have a knudsen salinity of 35.00ppt a pss-78 practical salinity of about 35.0 and a teos-10 absolute salinity of about 35.2g kg the electrical conductivity of this water at a temperature of 15c is 42.9 ms cm lakes and rivers 
 and chemists often define salinity in terms of mass of salt per unit volume expressed in units of mg per litre or g per litre it is implied although often not stated that this value applies accurately only at some reference temperature values presented in this way are typically accurate to the order of 1 limnologists also use  or  reference conductivity  as a proxy for salinity this measurement may be corrected for temperature effects and is usually expressed in units of s cm a river or lake water with a salinity of around 70mg l will typically have a specific conductivity at 25c of between 80 and 130s cm the actual ratio depends on the ions present the actual conductivity usually changes by about 2 per degree celsius so the measured conductivity at 5c might only be in the range of 5080s cm direct density measurements are also used to estimate salinities particularly in highly  sometimes density at a specific temperature is used as a proxy for salinity at other times an empirical salinity density relationship developed for a particular body of water is used to estimate the salinity of samples from a measured density 

systems of classification of water bodies based upon salinity 

marine waters are those of the ocean another term for which is euhaline seas the salinity of euhaline seas is 30 to 35 brackish seas or waters have salinity in the range of 0.5 to 29 and metahaline seas from 36 to 40 these waters are all regarded as thalassic because their salinity is derived from the ocean and defined as homoiohaline if salinity does not vary much over time  essentially constant  the table on the right modified from por  1972  follows the  venice system   1959  in contrast to homoiohaline environments are certain poikilohaline environments  which may also be thalassic  in which the salinity variation is biologically significant poikilohaline water salinities may range anywhere from 0.5 to greater than 300 the important characteristic is that these waters tend to vary in salinity over some biologically meaningful range seasonally or on some other roughly comparable time scale put simply these are bodies of water with quite variable salinity highly saline water from which salts crystallize  or are about to  is referred to as  environmental considerations 
salinity is an ecological factor of considerable importance influencing the types of organisms that live in a body of water as well salinity influences the kinds of  that will grow either in a water body or on land fed by a water  or by a   a plant adapted to saline conditions is called a  a halophyte which is tolerant to  salinity are called  or  or  plants organisms  mostly bacteria  that can live in very salty conditions are classified as  or  specifically an organism that can withstand a wide range of salinities is  salt is expensive to remove from water and salt content is an important factor in water use  such as   the degree of salinity in oceans is a driver of the  where density changes due to both salinity changes and temperature changes at the surface of the ocean produce changes in buoyancy which cause the sinking and rising of water masses  are thought to contribute to global changes in carbon dioxide as more saline waters are less soluble to carbon dioxide in addition during glacial periods the  is such that a possible cause of reduced circulation is the production of stratified oceans hence it is difficult in this case to subduct water through the thermohaline circulation see also
