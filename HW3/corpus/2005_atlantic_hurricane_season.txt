seasonal forecasts 

forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert  and his associates at   csu  and separately by forecasters with the u.s government s   noaa  prior to and during the 2005 season gray issued four forecasts each time increasing the predicted level of activity the noaa issued two forecasts one shortly before the season and one two months into the season drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release nonetheless all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season preseason forecasts 
on december 3 2004 gray s team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2005 season predicting a slightly above-average season additionally the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the  and the florida peninsula though the forecast predicted above-average activity the level predicted was significantly less than the  on april 1 2005 after confirming that  conditions would not develop gray and his team revised the december forecast upward expecting 13 tropical storms instead of 11 and seven hurricanes instead of six in addition the chance of a storm impacting the united states was raised slightly on may 16 2005 16days before the season began noaa issued its outlook for the 2005 season forecasting a 70 chance of above-normal activity the   ace  value for the season was predicted to be 120190 of the median ace of 87.5  104 2 shortly thereafter on may 31 the day before the season officially began gray s team revised its april forecast upwards to 15 named storms 8 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes midseason outlook 
on august 2 after an extraordinarily active early season the noaa released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season the ace value was now forecast to be 180 to 270 of the median the noaa also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity on august 5 2005 gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast  it was consistent with noaa s update although neither the noaa nor gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity the actual ace would prove to be 248  104 kt2 277 of the median systems

 formed in cold waters in the northeast atlantic 

a number of storms that formed in 2005 exhibited unusual behavior and challenged forecasters  ability to make correct predictions  formed farther northeast in the atlantic than any other tropical cyclone on record at the timeonly  s  has formed farther northand then unexpectedly reached hurricane strength over waters considered too cold to support a hurricane  became the fastest-intensifying hurricane on record and later strengthened unexpectedly in the face of strong    and  all formed over the cold waters of the late-season eastern atlantic much like hurricane vince  though at lower latitudes  all three persisted in the face of heavy wind shear and epsilon managed to reach hurricane strength over waters well below the temperatures previously thought necessary for hurricane formation epsilon became the longest-lasting december hurricane while zeta became the longest-lasting storm in january records and notable events 
the 2005 season broke numerous records for tropical cyclone activity though it might not actually be the most active season in history since records before 1944 are incomplete number of storms 

during the season 28 storms formed  27 named and one unnamed  surpassing almost all records for storm formation in the atlantic more tropical storms hurricanes major hurricanes and category5 hurricanes formed during the season than in any previously recorded atlantic season the season was the first season to use  v  and  w  names and when the season ran out of official alphabetical names after the use of  forecasters resorted to using letters from the  for the first time  although  and  had been used for subtropical storms in the 1970s  almost every storm in 2005 set a record for early formation of the twenty-eight storms which formed twenty-two of them qualified as the earliest-forming storm of that number starting with  almost every storm was such  the record set by dennis was later broken by debby in 2012 which was again broken in 2016 with danielle  the season s activity was reflected with a very high cumulative   ace  rating of 250 this total ranks it as the second-most active season on record with only the 1933 season having a higher ace value ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34  39mph 63km h  or tropical storm strength although officially  are excluded from the total the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase intense storms

in july  became the strongest storm to form prior to august and the earliest category4 storm to form in the caribbean when  reached category5 intensity later in the month the 2005 season became the only season to have two hurricanes reach category4 intensity before the end of july  emily also broke dennis s nine-day-old record for the strongest storm on record before august emily was also the first category5 hurricane ever recorded in july and the earliest by nearly three weeks  beating   the high level of activity and strength was reflected in the  value at the end of july  at 63 it was the highest ever additionally seven storms formed before the end of july breaking the record of five set in the      and  seasons five of those storms formed during july also a new record after forming on november 29  became the longest-lasting december hurricane on record when it maintained hurricane strength from december 2 to december 7 epsilon is the second-strongest hurricane ever recorded in the month of december  only  of 1998 was stronger 
when  formed on december 30 it came second only to   also december 30 1954 but later in the day  as the latest ever that the last storm of the season formed zeta also became only the second storm after alice to persist through the end of the year and still be active at the start of the next main article

this was the same list used for the  with the exceptions of franklin and lee which replaced  and  the names not retired from this list were used again in the  storms were named franklin lee maria nate ophelia philippe rita stan tammy vince wilma beta gamma epsilon and zeta for the first  and only in the cases of rita stan and wilma  time in 2005  the names alpha and delta had been previously used in  for two  but this is the first time they have been used in this way  this season used fifteen previously unused names the most ever in an atlantic season additionally a subtropical storm that formed in early october was not recognized as such at the time and so did not receive a name vince and wilma were the first named   and   storms ever in the atlantic basin in the spring of 2006 the   five hurricane names      and  their replacements in the 2011 season were don katia rina sean and whitney respectively it was also decided it  was not practical to  retire into hurricane history  a letter in the greek alphabet  this surpassed the previous record for the number of hurricane names retired after a single season four  held by the   and  seasons  season effects

notes 



 there is an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 due to the lack of modern observation techniques see  this may have led to significantly lower ace ratings for hurricane seasons prior to 1910
