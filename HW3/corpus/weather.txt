weather is the state of the  describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold wet or dry calm or stormy clear or cloudy most weather phenomena occur in the lowest level of the atmosphere the  just below the  weather refers to day-to-day temperature and  activity whereas  is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time when used without qualification  weather  is generally understood to mean the weather of  weather is driven by air pressure temperature and moisture differences between one place and another these differences can occur due to the sun s angle at any particular spot which varies with  the strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale   the hadley cell the ferrel cell the polar cell and the  weather systems in the  such as  are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow because the earth s  is tilted relative to its orbital plane  is incident at different angles at different times of the year on earth s surface temperatures usually range 40c  40f to 100f  annually over thousands of years changes in earth s  can affect the amount and distribution of  received by the earth thus influencing long-term climate and global  surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the earth s surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the  for a future time and a given location the earth s weather system is a   as a result small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole human attempts to  have occurred throughout history and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on earth a famous landmark in the   s  is an  storm known to have existed for at least 300 years however weather is not limited to planetary bodies a star s  is constantly being lost to space creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the solar system the movement of mass ejected from the  is known as the

weather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the earth the process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances during rains precipitation the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air this causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic which aids the erosive properties of water the released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in  reactions that can affect the surface further  such as   and sodium and chloride ions  deposited in the seas oceans the sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils in this way weather plays a major role in  of the surface major wind and pressure systems and related weather

effect on humans
further information  
weather seen from an anthropological perspective is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses at least while being outside there are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is what makes it change the effect it has on humans in different situations etc therefore weather is something people often communicate about effects on populations

weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the  for a future time and a given location human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the nineteenth century weather forecasts are made by collecting  about the current state of the atmosphere and using  to project how the atmosphere will evolve once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in  current weather conditions and sky condition  are now used to determine future conditions on the other hand human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon which involve many disciplines such as pattern recognition skills  knowledge of model performance and knowledge of model biases the  nature of the atmosphere the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere error involved in measuring the initial conditions and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made  the range of the forecast  increases the use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome there are a variety of end users to weather forecasts weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property forecasts based on temperature and  are important to agriculture and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days in some areas people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy   and the  forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead to survive through them modification
