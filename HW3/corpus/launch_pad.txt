a launch pad is an above-ground platform from which apowered  or  is vertically launched a   or launch complex  is a facility which includes and provides required support for one or more launch pads a launch pad generally contains a fixed or mobile  which provides one or more access platforms to inspect and maintain the vehicle and an umbilical structure which provides the vehicle with   fluids electrical power communications and  prior to launch the service structure also provides access to the crew cabin for vehicles carrying humans the pad may contain a flame deflection structure to prevent the intense heat of the rocket exhaust from damaging the vehicle or pad structures and a sound suppression system spraying large quantities of water may be employed the pad may also be protected by  a launch pad is distinct from a   or missile silo  which also launches a missile vertically but is located underground in order to help harden it against enemy attack or conceal it from surveillance    oxidizer and  fuel  need to be continuously topped off  i.e boil-off replaced  during the launch sequence   as the vehicle awaits liftoff this becomes particularly important as complex sequences may be interrupted by planned or unplanned holds to fix problems most rockets need stable support for a few seconds after ignition while the engines build up to stable full  therefore the vehicle is commonly held on the pad by hold-down arms or  which are triggered when the vehicle is stable and ready to fly at which point all umbilical connections with the pad are released transport of rockets to the pad

there are several different types of launch site determined by the means by which the  gets to the pad 
the first large rocket the  travelled horizontally with its tail forward to the launch site at  this method was used for all large soviet rockets including the  and  in a similar manner at the soviet launch site near  a silo used to launch test rockets would have its top opened and a second stage and payload would be driven in horizontally and tilted on top of a first stage already in the silo the nose cone and some of the second stage remaining visible above ground hence no surface pad is used  russian silos are reusable this method was only used for the cosmos series of small satellite launching vehicles a method of assembling a large space vehicle vertically in a  on a   mlp  which contained the umbilical structure was invented for the   manned moon landing vehicle the mlp is then carried by a  which slowly drives to one of two pads at  at the  this facility was later used for the smaller apollo  and then the  a similar system is used to launch  rockets at  at  a french spaceport near  in  the  and  launch vehicles were transported with a mobile launcher platform on two parallel standard gauge railroad tracks from the integration building to launch areas at  and 41 this system is still in use for the  at  in california the  series of rockets were set up vertically in a gantry in a windowless building at  the outside walls of which were rolled away just at launch this was done for purposes of military secrecy similar systems are used at  and  at cape canaveral air force station for the      at csg for the  and  for the  in the 1920s  described a method in which the vehicle is assembled vertically on a floating barge which he used in the movie  this was seriously considered for use at kennedy space center launch complex 39 for the saturn v  but was rejected due to the instability of the top-heavy unfuelled rocket and gantry however the  service uses the converted self-propelled oil drilling platform  to transport  rockets horizontally to the  and then to erect and launch them into   rockets are transported vertically and then inserted into a silo as they are converted cold-launch  icbms
