acovered park in   during winter



winter is the   of the year in  and   winter does not occur in   it occurs after  and before  in each year winter is caused by the axis of the earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the  different cultures define different dates as the start of winter and some use a definition based on weather when it is winter in the  it is  in the  and vice versa in many regions winter is associated with  and  temperatures the moment of  is when the sun s elevation with respect to the north or south pole is at its most negative value  that is the sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole  meaning this day will have the shortest day and the longest night the earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice however and these depend on latitude due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the earth s elliptical orbit  see

etymology 
the  word  winter  comes from the  root  wend  relating to  cause

the tilt of the earth s axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather the earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44 to the plane of its orbit causing different latitudes to directly face the sun as the earth moves through its orbit this variation brings about seasons when it is winter in the northern hemisphere the southern hemisphere faces the sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the northern hemisphere conversely winter in the southern hemisphere occurs when the northern hemisphere is tilted more toward the sun from the perspective of an observer on the earth the winter sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer sun during winter in either hemisphere the lower altitude of the sun causes the sunlight to hit that hemisphere at an oblique angle in regions experiencing winter the same amount of  is spread out over a larger area this effect is compounded by the larger distance that the light must travel through the atmosphere allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat compared with these effects the changes in the distance of the earth from the sun are negligible the manifestation of the meteorological winter  freezing temperatures  in the northerly snowprone parallels is highly variable depending on elevation position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation a case in point is  a country normally associated with tough winters  on the  at a relative distance from large bodies of water has a january high of 11.3c  11.7f  and a low of 21.4c  6.5f  in comparison  on the coast with a marine influence from moderating pacific winds has a january low of 1.4c  34.5f  with days well above freezing at 6.9c  44.4f  both areas are on the  and in the same western half of the continent a similar effect although with less extreme differentials is found in europe where in spite of the northerly latitude of the islands the british isles has not a single non-mountain weather station with a below-freezing mean temperature meteorological reckoning

meteorological reckoning is the method of measuring the winter season used by  based on  sensible weather patterns  for record keeping purposes so the start of meteorological winter varies with latitude winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures this corresponds to the months of december january and february in the  and june july and august in the  the coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in january or february in the northern hemisphere and in june july or august in the southern hemisphere nighttime predominates in the winter season and in some regions winter has the highest rate of  as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures precluding evaporation  often develop and cause many transportation delays  also known as ice needles or ice crystals forms at temperatures approaching 40f  40c  due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder surface based air they are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape the   smhi  define winter as when the daily mean temperatures go below 0c  32f  for five consecutive days according to the smhi winter in scandinavia is more pronounced when atlantic lowpressure systems take more southerly and northerly routes leaving the path open for highpressure systems to come in and cold temperatures to occur as a result the coldest january on record in 1987 was also the sunniest in  accumulations of snow and ice are commonly associated with winter in the northern hemisphere due to the large land masses there in the southern hemisphere the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40s makes the winters milder  thus snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the southern hemisphere in this region snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the andes the great dividing range in australia and the mountains of new zealand and also occurs in the southerly  region of south america snow occurs year-round in  astronomical and other calendar-based reckoning

in the  some authorities define the period of winter based on astronomical fixed points  i.e based solely on the position of the earth in its orbit around the sun  regardless of weather conditions in one version of this definition winter begins at the  and ends at the  these dates are somewhat later than those used to define the beginning and end of the meteorological winter  usually considered to span the entirety of december january and february in the northern hemisphere and june july and august in the southern astronomically the winter solstice being the day of the year which has fewest hours of daylight ought to be in the middle of the season but  means that the coldest period normally follows the solstice by a few weeks in some cultures the season is regarded as beginning at the solstice and ending on the following   in the northern hemisphere depending on the year this corresponds to the period between 21 or 22 december and 19 20 or 21 march in the uk meteorologists consider winter to be the three coldest months of december january and february in scandinavia winter in one tradition begins on 14 october and ends on the last day of february in russia currently calendar winter starts on 1 december and lasts through to the end of february though traditionally it was reckoned from the   25 december in  or 7 january in gregorian  until the   25 march in julian  in many countries in the  including australia new zealand and south africa winter begins on 1 june and ends on 31 august in  such as ireland  using the   and in scandinavia the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter with the winter season beginning 1 november on  or  winter ends and spring begins on  or  which is 1 or 2 february this system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively  the three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during november december and january in the northern hemisphere and may june and july in the

the  and some other animals change color in winter 

ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates it is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term hibernal for this period of the year  the other ecological seasons being prevernal vernal estival serotinal and autumnal  the hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the earth the appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late january in mild temperate climates to survive the harshness of winter many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for  

 is a common effect of winter upon animals notably birds however the majority of birds do not migratethe  and  for example some  also migrate seasonally  is a state of reduced  during the winter some animals  sleep  during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns  e.g  frogs snakes and bats some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely this is the case for     and  resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature the color of the fur or plumage changes to white  in order to be confused with snow  and thus retains its  coloration year-round examples are the     and  some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter  this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur the coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling the heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for  who sought more profitable skins snow also affects the ways animals behave  many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it mice and  typically live under the snow layer 
some  never survive the winter other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle this is known as  as for  many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it larger plants particularly  usually let their upper part go dormant but their roots are still protected by the snow layer few plants bloom in the winter one exception being the  which flowers in time for  the process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called  exceptionally cold winters

humans evolved in tropical climates and met cold weather as they migrated into  although earlier populations certainly encountered southern hemisphere winters in  micro-evolution in caucasian asiatic and inuit people show some adaptation to the climate winter and human health 
humans are sensitive to cold see     slipping on black ice and falling  are other health concerns associated with cold and snowy weather in the northern hemisphere it is not unusual for homeless people to die from hypothermia in the winter one of the most common diseases associated with winter is  symptoms include    muscle pains  infection fatigue dizziness  and loss of  mythology
