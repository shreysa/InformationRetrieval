etymology
the state of hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island  a common hawaiian explanation of the name of hawaii is that was named for  a legendary figure from hawaiian myth he is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled the  word hawaii is very similar to   sawaiki with the  meaning  homeland   of hawaii are found in other polynesian languages including      avaiki  and     according to linguists pukui and elbert  lsewhere in polynesia hawaii or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home but in hawaii the name has no meaning  spelling of state name

the cost of living in hawaii specifically honolulu is high compared to that of most major u.s cities although it is 6.7 lower than in new york city and 3.6 lower than in san francisco these numbers may not take into account some costs such as increased travel costs for flights additional shipping fees and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the contiguous u.s while some online stores offer free shipping on orders to hawaii many merchants exclude hawaii alaska puerto rico and certain other u.s territories
