el niosouthern oscillation  enso  is an irregularly periodic variation in  and  over the tropical eastern pacific ocean affecting much of the tropics and subtropics the warming phase is known as  and the cooling phase as  southern oscillation is the accompanying atmospheric component coupled with the sea temperature change  el nio is accompanied with high and la nia with low air  in the tropical western pacific the two periods last several months each  typically occurring every few years  and their effects vary in intensity the two phases relate to the  discovered by  during the early twentieth century the walker circulation is caused by the  that results from a  over the eastern pacific ocean and a  over  when the walker circulation weakens or reverses an el nio results causing the ocean surface to be warmer than average as upwelling of cold water occurs less or not at all an especially strong walker circulation causes a la nia resulting in cooler ocean temperatures due to increased upwelling mechanisms that cause the oscillation remain under study the extremes of this climate pattern s oscillations cause extreme weather  such as floods and droughts  in many regions of the world developing countries dependent upon agriculture and fishing particularly those bordering the pacific ocean are the most affected

concept 
the el niosouthern oscillation is a single climate phenomenon that periodically fluctuates between three phases  neutral la nia or el nio la nia and el nio are opposite phases that require certain changes to take place in both the ocean and the atmosphere before an event is declared normally the northward flowing  brings relatively cold water from the  northwards along south america s west coast to the tropics where it is enhanced by up-welling taking place along the coast of  along the equator trade winds cause the ocean currents in the eastern pacific to draw water from the deeper ocean towards the surface helping to keep the surface cool under the influence of the equatorial trade winds this cold water flows westwards along the equator where it is slowly heated by the sun as a direct result sea surface temperatures in the western pacific are generally warmer by about 810c  1418f  than those in the eastern pacific this warmer area of ocean is a source for convection and is associated with cloudiness and rainfall during el nio years the cold water weakens or disappears completely as the water in the central and eastern pacific becomes as warm as the western pacific walker circulation

diagram of the quasi-equilibrium and  phase of the southern oscillation the walker circulation is seen at the surface as easterly trade winds which move water and air warmed by the sun towards the west the western side of the equatorial pacific is characterized by warm wet low pressure weather as the collected moisture is dumped in the form of typhoons and thunderstorms the ocean is some 60 centimetres  24in  higher in the western pacific as the result of this motion the water and air are returned to the east both are now much cooler and the air is much drier an el nio episode is characterised by a breakdown of this water and air cycle resulting in relatively warm water and moist air in the eastern pacific 

the walker circulation is caused by the  that results from a  over the eastern pacific ocean and a  over  the walker circulations of the tropical indian pacific and atlantic basins result in westerly surface winds in northern summer in the first basin and easterly winds in the second and third basins as a result the temperature structure of the three oceans display dramatic asymmetries the equatorial pacific and atlantic both have cool surface temperatures in northern summer in the east while cooler surface temperatures prevail only in the western indian ocean these changes in surface temperature reflect changes in the depth of the thermocline changes in the walker circulation with time occur in conjunction with changes in surface temperature some of these changes are forced externally such as the seasonal shift of the sun into the northern hemisphere in summer other changes appear to be the result of coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback in which for example easterly winds cause the sea surface temperature to fall in the east enhancing the zonal heat contrast and hence intensifying easterly winds across the basin these anomalous easterlies induce more equatorial  and raise the thermocline in the east amplifying the initial cooling by the southerlies this coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback was originally proposed by bjerknes from an oceanographic point of view the equatorial cold tongue is caused by easterly winds were the earth climate symmetric about the equator cross-equatorial wind would vanish and the cold tongue would be much weaker and have a very different zonal structure than is observed today during non-el nio conditions the walker circulation is seen at the surface as easterly trade winds that move water and air warmed by the sun toward the west this also creates ocean upwelling off the coasts of  and  and brings nutrient-rich cold water to the surface increasing fishing stocks the western side of the equatorial pacific is characterized by warm wet low-pressure weather as the collected moisture is dumped in the form of  and  the ocean is some 60cm  24in  higher in the western pacific as the result of this motion sea surface temperature oscillation 




the various  nio regions  where sea surface temperatures are monitored to determine the current enso phase  warm or cold 


within the  in the united states  in the nio 3.4 region which stretches from the 120th to 170th meridians west longitude astride the equator five degrees of latitude on either side is monitored this region is approximately 3,000 kilometres  1,900mi  to the southeast of  the most recent three-month average for the area is computed and if the region is more than 0.5c  0.9f  above  or below  normal for that period then an el nio  or la nia  is considered in progress the united kingdom s  also uses a several month period to determine enso state when this warming or cooling occurs for only seven to nine months it is classified as el nio la nia  conditions  when it occurs for more than that period it is classified as el nio la nia  episodes  



normal pacific pattern  equatorial winds gather warm water pool toward the west cold water upwells along south american coast        tao 



el nio conditions  warm water pool approaches the south american coast the absence of cold upwelling increases warming 


la nia conditions  warm water is farther west than usual 



neutral phase 




average equatorial pacific temperatures


if the temperature variation from climatology is within 0.5c  0.9f  enso conditions are described as neutral neutral conditions are the transition between warm and cold phases of enso ocean temperatures  by definition  tropical precipitation and wind patterns are near average conditions during this phase close to half of all years are within neutral periods during the neutral enso phase other climate anomalies patterns such as the sign of the  or the  exert more influence

when the walker circulation weakens or reverses and the  strengthens an el nio results causing the ocean surface to be warmer than average as upwelling of cold water occurs less or not at all offshore northwestern south america el nio    spanish pronunciation  is associated with a band of warmer than average ocean water temperatures that periodically develops off the pacific coast of south america el nio is  for  the boy  and the capitalized term el nio refers to the  jesus because periodic warming in the pacific near  is usually noticed around  it is a phase of  el niosouthern oscillation   enso  which refers to variations in the temperature of the surface of the tropical eastern pacific ocean and in air  in the tropical western pacific the warm oceanic phase el nio accompanies high air surface pressure in the western pacific mechanisms that cause the oscillation remain under study cold phase 
main article  
an especially strong walker circulation causes a la nia resulting in cooler ocean temperatures in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean due to increased upwelling la nia   spanish pronunciation  is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of el nio as part of the broader el nio southern oscillation  the name la nia originates from  meaning  the girl  analogous to el nio meaning  the boy  during a period of la nia the  across the equatorial eastern central pacific will be lower than normal by 35c in the united states an appearance of la nia happens for at least five months of la nia conditions however each country and island nation has a different threshold for what constitutes a la nia event which is tailored to their specific interests the  for example declares that a la nia event has started when the average five month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino.3 region is over 0.5c  0.90f  cooler for 6 consecutive months or longer transitional phases 
transitional phases at the onset or departure of el nio or la nia can also be important factors on global weather by affecting  significant episodes known as trans-nio are measured by the  examples of affected short-time climate in north america include precipitation in the northwest us and intense tornado activity in the contiguous us southern oscillation 




the regions where the air pressure are measured and compared to generate the southern oscillation index 

the southern oscillation is the atmospheric component of el nio this component is an oscillation in surface air pressure between the tropical eastern and the western  waters the strength of the southern oscillation is measured by the southern oscillation index  soi  the soi is computed from fluctuations in the surface air pressure difference between   in the pacific  and   on the indian ocean  
el nio episodes have negative soi meaning there is lower pressure over tahiti and higher pressure in darwin la nia episodes have positive soi meaning there is higher pressure in tahiti and lower in darwin 
low atmospheric pressure tends to occur over warm water and high pressure occurs over cold water in part because of deep convection over the warm water el nio episodes are defined as sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean thus resulting in a decrease in the strength of the pacific  and a reduction in rainfall over eastern and northern australia la nia episodes are defined as sustained cooling of the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean thus resulting in an increase in the strength of the pacific  and the opposite effects in australia when compared to el nio although the southern oscillation index has a long station record going back to the 1800s its reliability is limited due to the presence of both darwin and tahiti well south of the equator resulting in the surface air pressure at both locations being less directly related to enso to overcome this question a new index was created being named equatorial southern oscillation index  eqsoi  to generate this index data two new regions centered on the equator were delimited to create a new index  the western one is located over indonesia and the eastern one is located over equatorial pacific close to the  coast however data on eqsoi goes back only to 1949 maddenjulian oscillation

the maddenjulian oscillation or  mjo  is the largest element of the intraseasonal  30 to 90-day  variability in the tropical atmosphere and was discovered by roland madden and  of the   ncar  in 1971 it is a large-scale coupling between atmospheric circulation and tropical  rather than being a standing pattern like the el nio southern oscillation  enso  the mjo is a traveling pattern that propagates eastward at approximately 4 to 8m s  9 to 18mph  through the atmosphere above the warm parts of the indian and pacific oceans this overall circulation pattern manifests itself in various ways most clearly as anomalous  the wet phase of enhanced convection and  is followed by a dry phase where  activity is suppressed each cycle lasts approximately 3060 days because of this pattern the mjo is also known as the 30 to 60-day oscillation 30 to 60-day wave or intraseasonal oscillation there is strong year-to-year  interannual  variability in mjo activity with long periods of strong activity followed by periods in which the oscillation is weak or absent this interannual variability of the mjo is partly linked to the el niosouthern oscillation  enso  cycle in the pacific strong mjo activity is often observed 6  12 months prior to the onset of an el nio episode but is virtually absent during the maxima of some el nio episodes while mjo activity is typically greater during a la nia episode strong events in the maddenjulian oscillation over a series of months in the western pacific can speed the development of an el nio or la nia but usually do not in themselves lead to the onset of a warm or cold enso event however observations suggest that the 19821983 el nio developed rapidly during july 1982 in direct response to a  triggered by an mjo event during late may further changes in the structure of the mjo with the seasonal cycle and enso might facilitate more substantial impacts of the mjo on enso for example the surface westerly winds associated with active mjo convection are stronger during advancement toward el nio and the surface easterly winds associated with the suppressed convective phase are stronger during advancement toward la nina impacts




regional impacts of la nia 

developing countries dependent upon agriculture and fishing particularly those bordering the pacific ocean are the most affected by enso the effects of el nio in south america are direct and strong an el nio is associated with warm and very wet weather months in apriloctober along the coasts of northern  and  causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme la nia causes a drop in sea surface temperatures over southeast asia and heavy rains over  the  and  to the north across  la nia events lead to drier than normal conditions while el nio events do not have a correlation towards dry or wet conditions during el nio events increased precipitation is expected in california due to a more southerly zonal storm track during la nia increased precipitation is diverted into the  due to a more northerly storm track during la nia events the storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal winter conditions  in the form of increased snowfall  to the midwestern states as well as hot and dry summers during the el nio portion of  increased precipitation falls along the gulf coast and southeast due to a stronger than normal and more southerly  in the late winter and spring during el nio events drier than average conditions can be expected in hawaii on guam during el nio years dry season precipitation averages below normal however the threat of a tropical cyclone is over triple what is normal during el nio years so extreme shorter duration rainfall events are possible on american samoa during el nio events precipitation averages about 10percent above normal while la nia events lead to precipitation amounts which average close to 10percent below normal enso is linked to rainfall over puerto rico during an el nio snowfall is greater than average across the southern rockies and sierra nevada mountain range and is well-below normal across the upper midwest and great lakes states during a la nia snowfall is above normal across the pacific northwest and western great lakes on tehuantepecers

el nio events cause short-term  approximately 1 year in length  spikes in global average surface temperature while la nia events cause short term cooling therefore the relative frequency of el nio compared to la nia events can affect global temperature trends on decadal timescales over the last several decades the number of el nio events increased and the number of la nia events decreased although observation of enso for much longer is needed to detect robust changes the studies of historical data show the recent el nio variation is most likely linked to global warming for example one of the most recent results even after subtracting the positive influence of decadal variation is shown to be possibly present in the enso trend the amplitude of the enso variability in the observed data still increases by as much as 60 in the last 50 years future trends in enso are uncertain as different models make different predictions it may be that the observed phenomenon of more frequent and stronger el nio events occurs only in the initial phase of the global warming and then  e.g after the lower layers of the ocean get warmer as well  el nio will become weaker it may also be that the stabilizing and destabilizing forces influencing the phenomenon will eventually compensate for each other more research is needed to provide a better answer to that question the enso is considered to be a potential  in earth s climate and under the global warming can enhance or alternate regional climate extreme events through a strengthened teleconnection for example an increase in the frequency and magnitude of el nio events have triggered warmer than usual temperatures over the indian ocean by modulating the walker circulation this has resulted in a rapid warming of the indian ocean and consequently a weakening of the  on coral bleaching 
following the el nino event in 1997  1998 the largest recorded to date the pacific marine environmental laboratory attributes the first large-scale water bleaching event to the warming waters this process called reef symbiosis results from warming ocean water temperatures on hurricanes

based on modeled and observed   ace  el nio years usually result in less active hurricane seasons in the atlantic ocean but instead favor a shift of  activity in the pacific ocean compared to la nia years favoring above average hurricane development in the atlantic and less so in the pacific basin diversity 
the traditional enso  el nio southern oscillation  also called eastern pacific  ep  enso involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific however in the 1990s and 2000s nontraditional enso conditions were observed in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly  nio 1 and 2  is not affected but an anomaly arises in the central pacific  nio 3.4  the phenomenon is called central pacific  cp  enso  dateline  enso  because the anomaly arises near the   or enso  modoki   modoki is  for  similar but different  there are flavors of enso additional to ep and cp types and some scientists argue that enso exists as a continuum often with hybrid types the effects of the cp enso are different from those of the traditional ep enso the  leads to more hurricanes more frequently making landfall in the atlantic  leads to a rainfall increase over  and northern  rather than over the east as in a conventional la nia also la nia modoki increases the frequency of cyclonic storms over  but decreases the occurrence of severe storms in the  the recent discovery of enso modoki has some scientists believing it to be linked to global warming however comprehensive satellite data go back only to 1979 more research must be done to find the correlation and study past el nio episodes more generally there is no scientific consensus on how if  might affect enso there is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this  new  enso indeed a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence or both either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches or that other types should be distinguished such as standard and extreme enso following the asymmetric nature of the warm and cold phases of enso some studies could not identify such distinctions for la nia both in observations and in the climate models but some sources indicate that there is a variation on la nia with cooler waters on central pacific and average or warmer water temperatures on both eastern and western pacific also showing eastern pacific ocean currents going to the opposite direction compared to the currents in traditional la nias paleoclimate records 
different modes of enso-like events have been registered in paleoclimatic archives showing different triggering methods feedbacks and environmental responses to the geological atmospheric and oceanographic characteristics of the time these paleorecords can be used to provide a qualitative basis for conservation practices
