this article is about the area of frequent tropical cyclone activity in the atlantic ocean for other areas of frequent tropical cyclone activity see  hurricane alley is an area of warm water in the  stretching from the west coast of  to the east coast of  and  of the  many  form within this area the  of the atlantic in hurricane alley has grown slightly warmer over the past decades a particularly warm summer in 2005 led  to begin studying whether this trend would lead to an increase in  activity see effects of climate change below

the warm waters of hurricane alley are depicted in orange


hurricanes form over  waters in areas of high humidity light winds and warm sea surface temperatures these areas which were described above are usually between the latitudes of 8 and 20 north the perfect temperature for a hurricane is approximately 26c this temperature has been set as a standard if the water is colder the hurricane will most likely weaken but if the waters are warmer rapid growth can occur the area between 10 and 20n create the most hurricanes in a given season because of the warmer temperatures hurricanes do not form outside this range because the  is not strong enough to create the tight circulation needed and above this range the temperatures are too cool the waters are only at the necessary temperatures from july until mid-october in the atlantic this is the height of the  since hurricanes rely on  sometimes an active season in the beginning becomes quiet later this is because the hurricanes are so strong that they churn the waters and bring colder waters up from the deep this creates an area of the sea the size of the hurricane which has cooler waters which can be 5-10c lower than before the hurricane when a new hurricane moves over the cooler waters they have no fuel to continue to thrive so they weaken or even die out effects of climate change 
the relationship of  hurricane alley  to  is unclear recent scientific evidence suggests that hurricane intensity may be increasing due to warmer tropical sea surface temperature but the connection to atlantic hurricane frequency is less conclusive there is a debate as to whether climate change is causing more severe storms but more research is needed into hurricane dynamics historical trends 
according to an  hypothesis of geographer kam-biu liu an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the  coast and the  during the quiescent periods  30001400 bc and 1000 ad to present  a more northeasterly position of the azores high would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the atlantic coast during the hyperactive period  1400 bc to 1000 ad  more hurricanes were steered towards the gulf coast as the azores high was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the caribbean such a displacement of the azores high is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in  around 3200 years bp and a change towards more humid conditions in the  during the late as more moisture was pumped up the  through the gulf coast preliminary data from the northern atlantic coast seem to support the azores high hypothesis a 3,000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in  suggests that hurricane activity has increased significantly during the past 5001,000 years just as the gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium
