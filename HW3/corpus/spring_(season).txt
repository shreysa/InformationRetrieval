meteorological reckoning 
meteorologists generally define four seasons in many climatic areas  spring summer autumn  fall  and winter these are demarcated by the values of their average temperatures on a monthly basis with each season lasting three months the three warmest months are by definition summer the three coldest months are winter and the intervening gaps are spring and autumn spring when defined in this manner can start on different dates in different regions in most northern hemisphere  locations spring months are march april and may although differences exist from country to country  summer is june july august  autumn is september october november  winter is december january february  most southern hemisphere temperate locations have opposing seasons with spring in september october and november  meteorologists define the beginning of spring as the first occasion on which the average daytime temperature exceeds zero degrees celsius for seven consecutive days thus the date varies with latitude and elevation in  and  spring conventionally begins on 1 september and ends 30 november astronomical and solar reckoning

in  spring traditionally starts on february 1  although irish meteorologists consider the whole of february to be part of winter ecological reckoning 
the beginning of spring is not always determined by fixed calendar dates the phenological or ecological definition of spring relates to biological indicators such as the blossoming of a range of plant species the activities of animals and the special smell of soil that has reached the temperature for micro  to flourish these indicators along with the beginning of spring vary according to the local  and according to the specific  of a particular year most ecologists divide the year into six seasons that have no fixed dates in addition to spring ecological reckoning identifies an earlier separate prevernal  early or pre-spring  season between the hibernal  winter  and vernal  spring  seasons this is a time when only the hardiest flowers like the crocus are in bloom sometimes while there is still some snowcover on the ground natural events
