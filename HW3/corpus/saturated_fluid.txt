thermodynamic description of vaporliquid equilibrium 
the field of  describes when vaporliquid equilibrium is possible and its properties much of the analysis depends on whether the vapor and liquid consist of a single component or if they are mixtures pure  single-component  systems 
if the liquid and vapor are pure in that they consist of only one molecular component and no impurities then the equilibrium state between the two phases is described by the following equations 

 
  and


where  and  are the  within the liquid and vapor  and  are the  within the liquid and vapor and  and  are the molar   units of energy per   within the liquid and vapor respectively in other words the temperature pressure and molar gibbs free energy are the same between the two phases when they are at equilibrium an equivalent more common way to express the vaporliquid equilibrium condition in a pure system is by using the concept of  under this view equilibrium is described by the following equation 



where  and  are the  of the liquid and vapor respectively at the system temperature ts and pressure ps using fugacity is often more convenient for calculation given that the fugacity of the liquid is to a good approximation pressure-independent and it is often convenient to use the quantity  the dimensionless fugacity coefficient which is 1 for an  multicomponent systems 
in a multicomponent system where the vapor and liquid consist of more than one type of molecule describing the equilibrium state is more complicated for all components i in the system the equilibrium state between the two phases is described by the following equations 

 
  and


where p and t are the temperature and pressure for each phase and  and  are the  also called   units of energy per   within the liquid and vapor respectively for each phase the partial molar gibbs free energy is defined by

binary mixture vle data at a certain overall pressure such as 1atm showing mole fraction vapor and liquid concentrations when boiling at various temperatures can be shown as a two-dimensional  called a boiling-point diagram the mole fraction of component1 in the mixture can be represented by the symbol x1 the mole fraction of component2 represented by x2 is related to x1 in a binary mixture as follows 

x1   x2   1

in multi-component mixtures in general with n components this becomes 

x1   x2      xn   1



boiling-point diagram


the preceding equilibrium equations are typically applied for each phase  liquid or vapor  individually but the result can be plotted in a single diagram in a binary boiling-point diagram temperature t  is graphed vs x1 at any given temperature where both phases are present vapor with a certain mole fraction is in equilibrium with liquid with a certain mole fraction the two mole fractions often differ these vapor and liquid mole fractions are represented by two points on the same horizontal isotherm  constant t  line when an entire range of temperatures vs vapor and liquid mole fractions is graphed two  usually curved  lines result the lower one representing the mole fraction of the boiling liquid at various temperatures is called the  curve the upper one representing the mole fraction of the vapor at various temperatures is called the dew point curve these two curves necessarily meet where the mixture becomes purely one component namely where x1   0  and x2   1 pure component2  or x1   1  and x2   0 pure component1  the temperatures at those two points correspond to the boiling points of each of the two pure components for certain pairs of substances the two curves also coincide at some point strictly between x1   0 and x1   1 when they meet they meet tangently  the dew-point temperature always lies above the boiling-point temperature for a given composition when they are not equal the meeting point is called an  for that particular pair of substances it is characterized by an azeotrope temperature and an azeotropic composition often expressed as a mole fraction there can be maximum-boiling azeotropes where the azeotrope temperature is at a maximum in the boiling curves or minimum-boiling azeotropes where the azeotrope temperature is at a minimum in the boiling curves if one wants to represent a vle data for a three-component mixture as a boiling point  diagram  a  can be used two of the dimensions would be used to represent the composition mole fractions and the third dimension would be the temperature using two dimensions the composition can be represented as an equilateral triangle in which each corner represents one of the pure components the edges of the triangle represent a mixture of the two components at each end of the edge any point inside the triangle represents the composition of a mixture of all three components the mole fraction of each component would correspond to where a point lies along a line starting at that component s corner and perpendicular to the opposite edge the  and  data would become curved surfaces inside a triangular prism which connect the three boiling points on the vertical temperature  axes  each face of this triangular prism would represent a two-dimensional boiling-point diagram for the corresponding binary mixture due to their three-dimensional complexity such boiling-point diagrams are rarely seen alternatively the three-dimensional curved surfaces can be represented on a two-dimensional graph by the use of curved isotherm lines at graduated intervals similar to iso-altitude lines on a map two sets of such isotherm lines are needed on such a two-dimensional graph  one set for the bubble point surface and another set for the dew point surface k values and relative volatility values

vapor-liquid equilibrium diagram


for each component in a binary mixture one could make a vaporliquid equilibrium diagram such a diagram would graph liquid mole fraction on a horizontal axis and vapor mole fraction on a vertical axis in such vle diagrams liquid mole fractions for components 1 and 2 can be represented as x1 and x2 respectively and vapor mole fractions of the corresponding components are commonly represented as y1 and y2 similarly for binary mixtures in these vle diagrams 

x1   x2   1 and y1   y2   1

such vle diagrams are square with a diagonal line running from the  x1   0 y1   0  corner to the  x1   1 y1   1  corner for reference these types of vle diagrams are used in the  to determine the number of equilibrium stages  or   needed to distill a given composition binary feed mixture into one distillate fraction and one bottoms fraction corrections can also be made to take into account the incomplete efficiency of each tray in a distillation column when compared to a theoretical plate raoult s law 
main article  
at boiling and higher temperatures the sum of the individual component partial pressures becomes equal to the overall pressure which can symbolized as ptot under such conditions  would be in effect as follows 

ptot   p1   p2    
then for each component in the vapor phase 

y1   p1 ptot y2   p2 ptot  etc 
where p1   partial pressure of component 1 p2   partial pressure of component 2 etc  is approximately valid for mixtures of components between which there is very little interaction other than the effect of dilution by the other components examples of such mixtures includes mixtures of  which are non relatively inert  in many ways so there is little attraction or repulsion between the molecules raoult s law states that for components 1 2 etc in a mixture 

p1   x1po1 p2   x2po2  etc 
where po1 po2 etc are the vapor pressures of components 1 2 etc when they are pure and x1 x2 etc are mole fractions of the corresponding component in the liquid recall from the first section that vapor pressures of liquids are very dependent on temperature thus the po pure vapor pressures for each component are a function of temperature  t  for example commonly for a pure liquid component the  may be used to approximate how the vapor pressure varies as a function of temperature this makes each of the partial pressures dependent on temperature also regardless of whether raoult s law applies or not when raoult s law is valid these expressions become 

p1t   x1po1t p2t   x2po2t  etc 
at boiling temperatures if raoult s law applies the total pressure becomes 

ptot   x1po1t   x2po2t    etc 
at a given ptot such as 1atm and a given liquid composition t can be solved for to give the liquid mixture s boiling point or bubble point although the solution for t may not be mathematically analytical  i.e may require a numerical solution or approximation  for a binary mixture at a given ptot the bubble pointt can become a function of x1  or x2  and this function can be shown on a two-dimensional graph like a binary boiling point diagram at boiling temperatures if raoult s law applies a number of the preceding equations in this section can be combined to give the following expressions for vapor mole fractions as a function of liquid mole fractions and temperature 

y1   x1po1t ptot y2   x2po2t ptot  etc 
once the bubble point t s as a function of liquid composition in terms of mole fractions have been determined these values can be inserted into the above equations to obtain corresponding vapor compositions in terms of mole fractions when this is finished over a complete range of liquid mole fractions and their corresponding temperatures one effectively obtains a temperature t function of vapor composition mole fractions this function effectively acts as the dew point t function of vapor composition in the case of a binary mixture x2   1  x1 and the above equations can be expressed as 

y1   x1po1t ptot and
y2    1  x1 po2t ptot

for many kinds of mixtures particularly where there is interaction between components beyond simply the effects of dilution raoult s law does not work well for determining the shapes of the curves in the boiling point or vle diagrams even in such mixtures there are usually still differences in the vapor and liquid equilibrium concentrations at most points and distillation is often still useful for separating components at least partially for such mixtures empirical data is typically used in determining such boiling point and vle diagrams  have done a significant amount of research trying to develop equations for correlating and or predicting vle data for various kinds of mixtures which do not obey raoult s law well see also
