etymology
the word ocean comes from the figure in        keans pronounced  the elder of the  in classical  believed by the  and  to be the divine personification of the  an enormous  encircling the world the concept of keans has an  connection greek keans has been compared to the  epithetyna predicated of the dragon vtra who captured the cows rivers related to this notion the okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early greek vases earth s global ocean

the major oceanic zones based on depth and biophysical conditions


oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical  defined by physical and biological conditions the  includes all open ocean regions and can be divided into further regions categorized by depth and light abundance the  includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200m  it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is therefore the most  because plants require  life found deeper than the photic zone must either rely on material sinking from above  see   or find another energy source  are the primary source of energy in what is known as the   depths exceeding 200m  the pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the  the pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into vertical regions according to temperature the  is the uppermost region its lowermost boundary is at a  of 12c  54f  which in the  generally lies at 7001,000 meters  2,3003,300ft  next is the  lying between 10 and 4c  50 and 39f  typically between 7001,000 meters  2,3003,300ft  and 2,0004,000 meters  6,60013,100ft  lying along the top of the  is the  whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000 meters  20,000ft  the last zone includes the deep  and is known as the  this lies between 6,00011,000 meters  20,00036,000ft  and is the deepest oceanic zone the  zones are aphotic and correspond to the three deepest zones of the  the  covers the continental slope down to about 4,000 meters  13,000ft  the abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000m lastly the  zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone which is found in oceanic trenches the pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two subregions  the  and the  the neritic zone encompasses the water mass directly above the  whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water in contrast the  covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions it is also known as the  zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region the ocean can be divided into three density zones  the surface zone the  and the  the surface zone also called the mixed layer refers to the uppermost density zone of the ocean temperature and salinity are relatively constant with depth in this zone due to currents and wave action the surface zone contains ocean water that is in contact with the atmosphere and within the photic zone the surface zone has the ocean s least dense water and represents approximately 2 of the total volume of ocean water the surface zone usually ranges between depths of 500 feet  150m  to 3,300 feet  1,000m  below ocean surface but this can vary a great deal in some cases the surface zone can be entirely non-existent the surface zone is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude the transition to colder denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes the pycnocline refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature the pycnocline effectively separates the lower-density surface zone above from the higher-density deep zone below the pycnocline represents approximately 18 of the total volume of ocean water the deep zone refers to the lowermost density zone of the ocean the deep zone usually begins at depths below 3,300 feet  1,000m  in mid-latitudes the deep zone undergoes negligible changes in water density with depth the deep zone represents approximately 80 of the total volume of ocean water the deep zone contains relatively colder and stable water if a zone undergoes dramatic changes in temperature with depth it contains a  the tropical thermocline is typically deeper than the thermocline at higher latitudes polar waters which receive relatively little solar energy are not stratified by temperature and generally lack a thermocline because surface water at polar latitudes are nearly as cold as water at greater depths below the thermocline water is very cold ranging from 1c to 3c because this deep and cold layer contains the bulk of ocean water the average temperature of the world ocean is 3.9c  if a zone undergoes dramatic changes in salinity with depth it contains a  if a zone undergoes a strong vertical chemistry gradient with depth it contains a  the halocline often coincides with the thermocline and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline exploration

mixing time
the residence time is the amount of an element in the ocean divided by the rate at which that element is added to  or removed from  the ocean the mean oceanic  is thought to be approximately 1,600 years if a given element in the ocean stays in the ocean on average longer than the oceanic mixing time then that element is assumed to be homogeneously spread throughout the ocean as a result because the major salts have a  that is longer than 1,600 years the ratio of major salts is thought to be unchanging across the ocean this constant ratio is often referred to as  or the principle of constant proportions 
salinity
a zone of rapid salinity increase with depth is called a  the temperature of maximum density of  decreases as its salt content increases freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity and boiling temperature of water increases with  typical seawater freezes at around 1.9c at  if precipitation exceeds evaporation as is the case in polar and temperate regions salinity will be lower if evaporation exceeds precipitation as is the case in tropical regions salinity will be higher thus oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions salinity can be calculated using the chlorinity which is a measure of the total mass of halogen ions  includes fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine  in seawater by international agreement the following formula is used to determine salinity

artist s conception of subsurface ocean of enceladus confirmed april 3 2014 





two models for the composition of europa predict a large subsurface ocean of liquid water similar models have been proposed for other celestial bodies in the solar system 

although earth is the only known  with large stable bodies of liquid water on its surface and the only one in the  other celestial bodies are thought to have large oceans planets
the   and  are thought to lack surfaces and instead have a stratum of  however their  is not well understood the possibility of the   and  having hot highly compressed  water under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised although their composition is still not fully understood a 2006 study by wiktorowicz and ingersall ruled out the possibility of such a water  ocean  existing on neptune though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid  are possible the  suggests that nearly a third of the surface of mars was once covered by water though the water on mars is no longer oceanic  much of it residing in the   the possibility continues to be studied along with reasons for their apparent disappearance astronomers think that  had liquid water and perhaps oceans in its very early history  if they existed all later vanished via  natural satellites

rendering of a hypothetical large  with surface liquid-water oceans


some planets and natural satellites outside the solar system are likely to have oceans including possible water ocean planets similar to earth in the  or  liquid-water belt  the detection of oceans even through the  method however is likely extremely difficult and inconclusive theoretical models have been used to predict with high probability that  detected by transit is composed of exotic form of  making up 75 of its mass making it an  other possible candidates are merely speculated based on their mass and position in the habitable zone include planet though little is actually known of their composition some scientists speculate  may be an  ocean-like  planet models have been proposed for  that could include surface oceans  is speculated to have an ocean of  hot ice   orbiting planets particularly gas giants within their parent star s habitable zone may theoretically have surface oceans terrestrial planets will acquire water during their accretion some of which will be buried in the magma ocean but most of it will go into a steam atmosphere and when the atmosphere cools it will collapse on to the surface forming an ocean there will also be outgassing of water from the mantle as the magma solidifiesthis will happen even for planets with a low percentage of their mass composed of water so  super-earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major accretionary impact 
non-water surface liquids
oceans seas lakes and other bodies of liquids can be composed of liquids other than water for example the  lakes on  the possibility of seas of  on  was also considered but ruled out there is evidence that the icy surfaces of the moons    titan and  are shells floating on oceans of very dense liquid water or waterammonia earth is often called the ocean planet because it is 70 covered in water extrasolar  that are extremely close to their parent star will be tidally locked and so one half of the planet will be a magma ocean it is also possible that terrestrial planets had magma oceans at some point during their formation as a result of giant impacts  close to their star could lose their atmospheres via  leaving behind their cores with various liquids on the surface where there are suitable temperatures and pressures volatile chemicals that might exist as liquids in abundant quantities on planets include                and  supercritical fluids although not liquids do share various properties with liquids underneath the thick atmospheres of the planets  and  it is expected that these planets are composed of oceans of hot high-density fluid mixtures of water ammonia and other volatiles the gaseous outer layers of  and  transition smoothly into oceans of   the  is 96.5  which is a supercritical fluid at its surface see also
