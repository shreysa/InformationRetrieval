formation 
wake lows form due to  warming in the wake of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields where  cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric  or downward motion they can be caused by  which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a  as with mesoscale  behind a squall line when new  development stops along the squall line the wake low will weaken as well clearing conditions will accompany the wake low due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature within the  these systems have been observed to form in the  valley southeast  and  detection 




this radar image shows the location of a wake low wind event near  note the minimum in the radar returns in that area 

both direct and indirect ways have been found to indicate the presence of a wake depression the most direct is through the use of surface observations prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks or mesonets it was difficult to locate wake lows with the advent of mesoscale networks wake lows have become easier to detect on  and  imagery wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area however within larger precipitation areas they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns when using velocity data from a  doppler radar high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low association with heat bursts 
main article  
heat bursts are rare atmospheric phenomenon characterized by gusty winds and a rapid increase in  and decrease in   moisture  heat bursts typically occur during night-time and are associated with decaying  in association with wake lows heat bursts are caused when rain evaporates   into a parcel of cold dry air high in the atmosphere making the air denser than its surroundings the parcel descends rapidly warming due to compression overshoots its  and reaches the surface similar to a  recorded temperatures during heat bursts have reached well above 90  32  sometimes rising by 20f  11c  or more within only a few minutes more extreme events have also been documented where temperatures have been reported to exceed 130f  54c  although such extreme events have never been officially verified heat bursts are also characterised by extremely dry air and are sometimes associated with very strong even damaging  see also
