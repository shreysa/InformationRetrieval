landfalls 

of the 118category4 hurricanes that have formed in the eastern and central pacific basins 25have made  of them four made landfall at category4 intensity three at category3 eleven at categories2 and 1 six as tropical storms and five as tropical depressions several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining category4 status as they approached land  this is usually a result of dry air shallower water due to  cooler waters or interaction with land only in five years 1976 1983 1992 1997 and 2014 more than one category4 hurricane made landfall and only during one year 1992 did three category4 hurricanes made landfall

 the  devised in 1971 is used to categorize the intensity of  in the atlantic and pacific oceans  though  of 2001 made a second landfall in october it did so after it re-generated the landfall is included in the  september  total but not the  october  total
