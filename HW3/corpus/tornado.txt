etymology
the word tornado is an altered form of the spanish word tronada which means  thunderstorm  this in turn was taken from the latin tonare meaning  to thunder  it most likely reached its present form through a combination of the spanish tronada and tornar  to turn  however this may be a  a tornado is also commonly referred to as a  twister  and is also sometimes referred to by the old-fashioned colloquial term cyclone the term  cyclone  is used as a synonym for  tornado  in the often-aired 1939 film  the term  twister  is also used in that film along with being the title of the 1996 tornado-related film  definitions




a tornado near  1979


a tornado is  a violently rotating column of air in contact with the ground either pendant from a  or underneath a cumuliform cloud and often  but not always  visible as a funnel cloud  for a vortex to be classified as a tornado it must be in contact with both the ground and the cloud base scientists have not yet created a complete definition of the word  for example there is disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes tornado refers to the  of wind not the condensation cloud funnel cloud
main article  




this tornado has no funnel cloud  however the rotating dust cloud indicates that strong winds are occurring at the surface and thus it is a true tornado 

a tornado is not necessarily visible  however the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds  as described by   and rapid rotation  due to   usually cause  in the air to condense into cloud droplets due to  this results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel there is some disagreement over the definition of a funnel cloud and a condensation funnel according to the glossary of meteorology a funnel cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition among many meteorologists the  funnel cloud  term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud tornadoes often begin as funnel clouds with no associated strong winds at the surface and not all funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground so it is difficult to discern the difference between a funnel cloud and a tornado from a distance outbreaks and families
main articles    and 
occasionally a single storm will produce more than one tornado either simultaneously or in succession multiple tornadoes produced by the same  are referred to as a  tornado family  several tornadoes are sometimes spawned from the same large-scale storm system if there is no break in activity this is considered a tornado outbreak  although the term  tornado outbreak  has various definitions  a period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area  spawned by multiple weather systems  is a tornado outbreak sequence occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak characteristics
size and shape




a wedge tornado nearly a mile wide which hit 


most tornadoes take on the appearance of a narrow  a few hundred yards  meters  across with a small cloud of debris near the ground tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust these tornadoes are especially dangerous as even experienced meteorologists might not see them tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes small relatively weak landspouts may be visible only as a small swirl of dust on the ground although the condensation funnel may not extend all the way to the ground if associated surface winds are greater than 40mph  64km h  the circulation is considered a tornado a tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a  stovepipe  tornado large single-vortex tornadoes can look like large  stuck into the ground and so are known as  wedge tornadoes  or  wedges  the  stovepipe  classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile a wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance many but not all major tornadoes are wedges 



a rope tornado in its dissipating stage  

tornadoes in the dissipating stage can resemble narrow tubes or ropes and often curl or twist into complex shapes these tornadoes are said to be  roping out  or becoming a  rope tornado  when they rope out the length of their funnel increases which forces the winds within the funnel to weaken due to  multiple-vortex tornadoes can appear as a family of swirls circling a common center or they may be completely obscured by condensation dust and debris appearing to be a single funnel in the united states tornadoes are around 500 feet  150m  across on average and travel on the ground for 5 miles  8.0km  however there is a wide range of tornado sizes weak tornadoes or strong yet dissipating tornadoes can be exceedingly narrow sometimes only a few feet or couple meters across one tornado was reported to have a damage path only 7 feet  2.1m  long on the other end of the spectrum wedge tornadoes can have a damage path a mile  1.6km  wide or more a  on may 22 2004 was up to 2.5 miles  4.0km  wide at the ground and  on may 31 2013 was approximately 2.6 miles  4.2km  wide the widest on record in terms of path length the  which affected parts of   and  on march 18 1925 was on the ground continuously for 219 miles  352km  many tornadoes which appear to have path lengths of 100 miles  160km  or longer are composed of a family of tornadoes which have formed in quick succession  however there is no substantial evidence that this occurred in the case of the tri-state tornado in fact modern reanalysis of the path suggests that the tornado may have begun 15 miles  24km  further west than previously thought appearance
tornadoes can have a wide range of colors depending on the environment in which they form those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible marked only by swirling debris at the base of the funnel condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white while traveling over a body of water  as a waterspout  tornadoes can turn white or even blue slow-moving funnels which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt are usually darker taking on the color of debris tornadoes in the  can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground turning white 



photographs of the  tornado of may 30 1976 taken at nearly the same time by two photographers in the top picture the tornado is lit with the sunlight focused from behind the  thus the funnel appears bluish in the lower image where the camera is facing the opposite direction the sun is behind the tornado giving it a dark appearance 

lighting conditions are a major factor in the appearance of a tornado a tornado which is    viewed with the sun behind it  appears very dark the same tornado viewed with the sun at the observer s back may appear gray or brilliant white tornadoes which occur near the time of sunset can be many different colors appearing in hues of yellow orange and pink dust kicked up by the winds of the parent thunderstorm heavy rain and hail and the darkness of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous since only  observations or possibly the sound of an approaching tornado serve as any warning to those in the storm s path most significant tornadoes form under the storm s updraft base which is rain-free making them visible also most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning there is mounting evidence including  mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts that most tornadoes have a clear calm center with extremely low pressure akin to the  of  lightning is said to be the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen the interior of a tornado rotation
tornadoes normally rotate   when viewed from above this is counterclockwise in the  and clockwise in the   while large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the  thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the coriolis effect is unimportant as indicated by their large  supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the coriolis effect is neglected low-level  and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment approximately 1percent of tornadoes rotate in an anticyclonic direction in the northern hemisphere typically systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending   rfd  in a cyclonic supercell on rare occasions  form in association with the mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell in the same manner as the typical cyclonic tornado or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell sound and seismology




an illustration of generation of infrasound in tornadoes by the  s infrasound program


tornadoes emit widely on the   and the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms various sounds of tornadoes have been reported mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar popularly reported sounds include a freight train rushing rapids or waterfall a nearby jet engine or combinations of these many tornadoes are not audible from much distance  the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography the winds of the tornado vortex and of constituent turbulent  as well as airflow interaction with the surface and debris contribute to the sounds funnel clouds also produce sounds funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling whining humming or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity or more or less harmonic whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous deep rumbling or an irregular sound of  noise  since many tornadoes are audible only when very near sound is not to be thought of as a reliable warning signal for a tornado tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms  any strong damaging wind a severe hail volley or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound tornadoes also produce identifiable inaudible  signatures unlike audible signatures tornadic signatures have been isolated  due to the long distance propagation of low-frequency sound efforts are ongoing to develop tornado prediction and detection devices with additional value in understanding tornado morphology dynamics and creation tornadoes also produce a detectable  signature and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process electromagnetic lightning and other effects
tornadoes emit on the  with  and  effects detected there are observed correlations between tornadoes and patterns of lightning tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all more often than not overall cloud-to-ground  cg  lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface and returns to the baseline level when the tornado dissipates in many cases intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity cg discharges  and lightning have little or nothing to do directly with what drives tornadoes  tornadoes are basically a  phenomenon  although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena  has been reported in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning city lights and  from broken lines as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded in addition to winds tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as   and  for example on june 24 2003 near  a probe measured a 100     2.95  pressure decrease the pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850     25.10  in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away resulting in a v-shape pressure trace temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado life cycle

supercell relationship
see also  
tornadoes often develop from a class of thunderstorms known as supercells supercells contain  an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere usually 16 miles  1.69.7 kilometres  across most intense tornadoes  ef3 to ef5 on the   develop from supercells in addition to tornadoes very heavy rain frequent lightning strong wind gusts and hail are common in such storms most tornadoes from supercells follow a recognizable life cycle that begins when increasing rainfall drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft  rfd  this downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground and drags the supercell s rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it formation
as the mesocyclone lowers below the cloud base it begins to take in cool moist air from the downdraft region of the storm the convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form the rfd also focuses the mesocyclone s base causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground as the updraft intensifies it creates an area of low pressure at the surface this pulls the focused mesocyclone down in the form of a visible condensation funnel as the funnel descends the rfd also reaches the ground fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado usually the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground  becoming a tornado  within a few minutes of the rfd reaching the ground maturity
initially the tornado has a good source of warm moist air  to power it and it grows until it reaches the  mature stage  this can last anywhere from a few minutes to more than an hour and during that time a tornado often causes the most damage and in rare cases can be more than onemile  1.6km  across the low pressured atmosphere at the base of the tornado is essential to the endurance of the system meanwhile the rfd now an area of cool surface winds begins to wrap around the tornado cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado dissipation
as the rfd completely wraps around and chokes off the tornado s air supply the vortex begins to weaken and become thin and rope-like this is the  dissipating stage  often lasting no more than a few minutes after which the tornado ends during this stage the shape of the tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm and can be blown into fantastic patterns even though the tornado is dissipating it is still capable of causing damage the storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and due to  winds can increase at this point as the tornado enters the dissipating stage its associated mesocyclone often weakens as well as the rear flank downdraft cuts off the inflow powering it sometimes in intense supercells tornadoes can develop  as the first mesocyclone and associated tornado dissipate the storm s inflow may be concentrated into a new area closer to the center of the storm and possibly feed a new mesocyclone if a new mesocyclone develops the cycle may start again producing one or more new tornadoes occasionally the old  occluded  mesocyclone and the new mesocyclone produce a tornado at the same time although this is a widely accepted theory for how most tornadoes form live and die it does not explain the formation of smaller tornadoes such as landspouts long-lived tornadoes or tornadoes with multiple vortices these each have different mechanisms which influence their developmenthowever most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one types
multiple vortex
main article  




a multiple-vortex  outside  on april 2 1957 

a multiple-vortex tornado is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate about their own axis and at the same time around a common center a multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation but is very often observed in intense tornadoes these vortices often create small areas of heavier damage along the main tornado path this is a phenomenon that is distinct from a  which is a smaller tornado which forms very near a large strong tornado contained within the same mesocyclone the satellite tornado may appear to   the larger tornado  hence the name  giving the appearance of one large multi-vortex tornado however a satellite tornado is a distinct circulation and is much smaller than the main funnel waterspout

a waterspout near the  in 1969 

a waterspout is defined by the  as a tornado over water however researchers typically distinguish  fair weather  waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common and are similar to  and  they form at the bases of  clouds over tropical and subtropical waters they have relatively weak winds smooth  walls and typically travel very slowly they occur most commonly in the  and in the northern  in contrast tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water they form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water since they form from  and can be far more intense faster and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts they are more dangerous in official tornado statistics waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land though some european weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together landspout
main article  
a landspout or dust-tube tornado is a tornado not associated with a mesocyclone the name stems from their characterization as a  fair weather waterspout on land  waterspouts and landspouts share many defining characteristics including relative weakness short lifespan and a small smooth condensation funnel which often does not reach the surface landspouts also create a distinctively laminar cloud of dust when they make contact with the ground due to their differing mechanics from true mesoform tornadoes though usually weaker than classic tornadoes they can produce strong winds which could cause serious damage similar circulations
gustnado
main article  
a gustnado or gust front tornado is a small vertical swirl associated with a  or  because they are not connected with a cloud base there is some debate as to whether or not gustnadoes are tornadoes they are formed when fast moving cold dry outflow air from a  is blown through a mass of stationary warm moist air near the outflow boundary resulting in a  rolling  effect  often exemplified through a   if low level  is strong enough the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground the result is a gustnado they usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage dust devil

a dust devil in 


a dust devil  also known as a whirlwind  resembles a tornado in that it is a vertical swirling column of air however they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes they form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day if there is enough low level wind shear the column of hot rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground they are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds however they can on occasion result in major damage fire whirls
main article  
small-scale tornado-like circulations can occur near any intense surface heat source those that occur near intense  are called fire whirls they are not considered tornadoes except in the rare case where they connect to a  or other cumuliform cloud above fire whirls usually are not as strong as tornadoes associated with thunderstorms they can however produce significant damage steam devils
main article  
a steam devil is a   between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke these formations do not involve high wind speeds only completing a few rotations per minute steam devils are very rare they most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant s smokestack  and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter faster-rotating steam devil to form the phenomenon can occur over water when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water

the united states has the most tornadoes of any country nearly four times more than estimated in all of europe excluding waterspouts this is mostly due to the unique geography of the continent north america is a large continent that extends from the  north into  areas and has no major east-west mountain range to block air flow between these two areas in the  where most tornadoes of the world occur the  block moisture and buckle the  forcing drier air at mid-levels of the  due to downsloped winds and causing  downwind to the east of the mountains increased westerly flow off the rockies force the formation of a  when the flow aloft is strong while the  fuels abundant low-level moisture in the southerly flow to its east this unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air the conditions that breed strong long-lived storms throughout the year a large portion of these tornadoes form in an area of the  known as  this area extends into  particularly  and the  although southeast  the interior of  and western  are also tornado-prone tornadoes also occur across northeastern mexico the united states averages about 1,200 tornadoes per year followed by canada averaging 62 reported per year noaa s has a higher average 100 per year in canada the netherlands has the highest average number of recorded tornadoes per area of any country  more than 20 or 0.0013 per sqmi  0.00048 per km2  annually  followed by the uk  around 33 or 0.00035 per sqmi  0.00013 per km2  per year  although those are of lower intensity briefer and cause minor damage 



intense tornado activity in the united states the darker-colored areas denote the area commonly referred to as

main article  
rigorous attempts to warn of tornadoes began in the united states in the mid-20th century before the 1950s the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground often news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm however with the advent of weather radar areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather the first public  were issued in 1950 and the first  and  in 1952 in 1953 it was confirmed that  are associated with tornadoes by recognizing these radar signatures meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away radar
see also   and 
today most developed countries have a network of weather radars which remains the main method of detecting signatures probably associated with tornadoes in the united states and a few other countries doppler weather radar stations are used these devices measure the velocity and radial   towards or away from the radar  of the winds in a storm and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than one hundred miles  160km  away when storms are distant from a radar only areas high within the storm are observed and the important areas below are not sampled data resolution also decreases with distance from the radar some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data doppler radar systems can detect  within the supercell of a thunderstorm this allows meteorologists to predict tornado formations throughout thunderstorms

storm spotting
in the mid-1970s the u.s national weather service  nws  increased its efforts to train  to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail damaging winds and tornadoes as well as damage itself and  the program was called  and the spotters were local sheriff s deputies state troopers firefighters ambulance drivers    now   spotters  and ordinary citizens when severe weather is anticipated local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather and report any tornadoes immediately so that the office can warn of the hazard usually spotters are trained by the nws on behalf of their respective organizations and report to them the organizations activate public warning systems such as  and the   eas  and forward the report to the nws there are more than 230,000 trained skywarn weather spotters across the united states in canada a similar network of volunteer weather watchers called  helps spot severe weather with more than 1,000 volunteers in europe several nations are organizing spotter networks under the auspices of  and the tornado and storm research organisation  torro  has maintained a network of spotters in the united kingdom since 1974 storm spotters are needed because radar systems such as  do not detect a tornado  merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado but  from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent the spotter s ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar chiefly due to curvature of earth and the beam also spreads out visual evidence

though tornadoes can strike in an instant there are precautions and preventative measures that people can take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado authorities such as the  advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued when a warning is issued going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival in tornado-prone areas many buildings have  on the property these underground refuges have saved thousands of lives some countries have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert of a possible tornado  such as  and  in the united states and canada   provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area though these are mainly available only in the united states unless the tornado is far away and highly visible meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far to the side of the road  so as not to block emergency traffic  and find a sturdy shelter if no sturdy shelter is nearby getting low in a ditch is the next best option highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass myths and misconceptions
main article  
folklore often identifies a green sky with tornadoes and though the phenomenon may be associated with severe weather there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes it is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado while there is a large drop in  inside a strong tornado it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado s damage a violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed 



the  disproved several misconceptions including the idea that tornadoes cannot occur in cities 

another commonly held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes this belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the  near  where a news crew and several other people take shelter under an overpass on the  and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by however a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events  the storm in question was a weak tornado the tornado did not directly strike the overpass and the overpass itself was of a unique design due to the  tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass indeed in the  of may 3 1999 three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes and at each of the three locations there was a fatality along with many life-threatening injuries by comparison during the same tornado outbreak more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed with another 7000 damaged and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes an old belief is that the southwest corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado the safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado s direction of approach  usually the northeast corner  or the central-most room on the lowest floor taking shelter in a basement under a staircase or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival there are areas which people believe to be protected from tornadoes whether by being in a city near a major river hill or mountain or even protected by  forces tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers climb mountains affect valleys and have damaged  as a general rule no area is safe from tornadoes though some areas are more susceptible than others ongoing research

meteorology is a relatively young science and the study of tornadoes is newer still although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery scientists have a fairly good understanding of the development of  and mesocyclones and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation however the step from  or other respective formative processes to  and the prediction of tornadic vs non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research also under study are the low-level mesocyclone and the  of low-level  which tightens into a tornado in particular what are the processes and what is the relationship of the environment and the convective storm intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft  rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis  and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone in particular the role of  particularly the  and the role of  boundaries are intense areas of study reliably predicting tornado intensity and longevity remains a problem as do details affecting characteristics of a tornado during its life cycle and tornadolysis other rich areas of research are tornadoes associated with  within linear thunderstorm structures and within tropical cyclones scientists still do not know the exact mechanisms by which most tornadoes form and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile  surface and aerial   and   passive and active  instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions  also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in  which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings many of which are otherwise unattainable importantly development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions research programs including field projects such as the   verification of the origins of rotation in tornadoes experiment  deployment of   the totable tornado observatory    dow  and dozens of other programs hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists universities government agencies such as the  private-sector meteorologists and the  are some of the organizations very active in research  with various sources of funding both private and public a chief entity being the  the pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken  gaps in information about the wind pressure and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere  and the computing power available for simulation solar storms similar to tornadoes have been recorded but it is unknown how closely related they are to their terrestrial counterparts gallery
