the military had been performing launch operations since 1949 at what would become  in december 1959 the  transferred 5,000 personnel and the missile firing laboratory to  to become the launch operations directorate under nasa s  president  s 1961 goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 required an expansion of launch operations on july 1 1962 the launch operations directorate was separated from msfc to become the launch operations center  loc  also cape canaveral was inadequate to host the new launch facility design required for the mammoth 363-foot  111m  tall 7,500,000-pound-force  33,000kn  thrust  rocket which would be assembled vertically in a large hangar and transported on a mobile platform to one of several launch pads therefore the decision was made to build a new loc site located adjacent to cape canaveral on  nasa began land acquisition in 1962 buying title to 131 square miles  340km2  and negotiating with the state of florida for an additional 87 square miles  230km2  the major buildings in ksc s industrial area were designed by architect  construction began in november 1962 and kennedy visited the site twice in 1962 and again just a week before  on november 22 1963 on november 29 1963 the facility was given its current name by president lyndon b johnson under  johnson s order joined both the civilian loc and the military cape canaveral station  the facilities of station no 1 of the atlantic missile range  under the designation  john f kennedy space center  spawning some confusion joining the two in the public mind nasa administrator  clarified this by issuing a directive stating the kennedy space center name applied only to the loc while the air force issued a general order renaming the military launch site cape kennedy air force station location 
located on  the center is north-northwest of  on the atlantic ocean midway between miami and  on florida s  due east of  it is 34 miles  55km  long and roughly six miles  9.7km  wide covering 219 square miles  570km2  ksc is a major central florida  and is approximately one hour s drive from the  area the  offers public tours of the center and cape canaveral air force station because much of the installation is a restricted area and only nine percent of the land is developed the site also serves as an important      and  are other features of the area center workers can encounter     the endangered   and  historical programs

a saturn v carrying  rolls out to pad 39a in 1971 on  

from 1967 through 1973 there were 13 saturn v launches including the ten remaining apollo missions after apollo 7 the first of two unmanned flights   apollo-saturn 501  on november 9 1967 was also the first rocket launch from ksc the saturn v s first manned launch on december 21 1968 was  s lunar orbiting mission the next two missions tested the     earth orbit  and   lunar orbit   launched from pad a on july 16 1969 made the first moon landing on july 20  followed four months later from 19701972 the apollo program concluded at ksc with the launches of missions 13 through 17 skylab 
on may 14 1973 the last  launch put the  space station in orbit from pad 39a by this time the cape kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the saturn ib were decommissioned and pad b was modified to launch three manned missions to skylab that year as well as the final apollo spacecraft for the  in 1975 space shuttle

 launching from pad 39a on  february 3 1994


as the space shuttle was being designed nasa received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than ksc which demanded study ksc had important advantages including  its existing facilities  location on the   and its southern latitude which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits disadvantages included  its inability to safely launch military missions into  since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the carolinas or cuba  corrosion from the salt air  and frequent cloudy or stormy weather although building a new site at  in new mexico was seriously considered nasa announced its decision in april 1972 to use ksc for the shuttle since the shuttle could not be landed automatically or by remote control the launch of  on april 12 1981 for its first orbital mission  was nasa s first manned launch of a vehicle that had not been tested in prior unmanned launches

in 1976 the vab s south parking area was the site of third century america a science and technology display commemorating the  concurrent with this event the u.s flag was painted on the south side of the vab during the late 1970s lc-39 was reconfigured to support the space shuttle two  were built near the vab as hangars with a third added in the 1980s ksc s 2.9-mile  4.7km    slf  was the orbiters  primary end-of-mission landing site although the first ksc landing did not take place until the tenth flight when  completed  on february 11 1984  the primary landing site until then was  in california subsequently used as a backup landing site the slf also provided a  option which was not utilized the slf is among the longest runways in the world after 24 successful shuttle flights challenger  73 seconds after the launch of  on january 28 1986  the first shuttle launch from pad 39b and the first u.s manned launch failure killing the seven crew members an  seal in the right booster rocket failed at liftoff leading to subsequent structural failures flights resumed on september 29 1988 with  after modifications to many aspects of the shuttle program on february 1 2003 columbia and her crew of seven were lost during  over texas during the  mission  the 113th shuttle flight  a vehicle breakup triggered by damage sustained during launch from pad 39a on january 16 when a piece of foam insulation from the orbiter s external fuel tank struck the orbiter s left wing during reentry the damage created a hole allowing hot gases to melt the wing structure like the challenger disaster the  interrupted shuttle flight operations at ksc for more than two years until the  launch on july 26 2005 the shuttle program experienced five  shutdowns at lc-39 all within four seconds before launch  and one   on july 29 1985 shuttle missions during nearly 30 years of operations included deploying satellites and interplanetary probes conducting space science and technology experiments  construction and servicing of the  deployment and servicing of the  and serving as a  the shuttle was retired from service in july 2011 after 135 launches constellation 
on october 28 2009 the  launch from pad 39b was the first unmanned launch from ksc since the skylab workshop in 1973 expendable launch vehicles  elvs 
beginning in 1958 nasa and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches  previously referred to as unmanned  cooperating as they broke ground in the field in the early 1960s nasa had as many as two robotic mission launches a month the frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles as engineers gathered data learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades in 1963 with the intent of ksc  work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities a separate atlas centaur organization was formed under nasa s lewis center  now   taking that responsibility from the launch operations center  aka ksc  though almost all robotics missions launched from the   ccafs  ksc  oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the cape  in 1965 ksc s unmanned launch operations directorate became responsible all nasa unmanned launch operations including those at  from the 1950s to 1978 ksc chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the u.s overseeing their near launch processing and checkout in addition to government missions ksc performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also though non-u.s government entities provided reimbursement nasa also funded ccafs launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements all this changed with the  after which nasa only coordinated its own and   noaa  elv launches companies were able to  operate their own launch vehicles  and utilize nasa s launch facilities payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of ksc reagan s 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from ksc to commercial companies that same year launch complexes on ccafs started transferring from nasa to air force management in the 1990s though ksc was not performing the hands-on elv work engineers still maintained understanding of elvs and had contracts allowing them insight in the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight ksc also worked on elv research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize ksc personnel as a resource for technical issues ksc with the payload and launch vehicle industries developed advances in automation of the elv launch and ground operations for the purpose of enabling competitiveness of u.s rockets against the global market in 1998 the   lsp  formed at ksc pulling together programs  and personnel  that already existed at ksc grc  and more to manage the launch of nasa and noaa robotic missions ccafs and vafb are the primary launch sites for lsp missions though other sites are occasionally used lsp payloads such as the  have been processed at ksc before being transferred to a launch pad on ccafs space station processing 
as the  modules design began in the early 1990s ksc began to work with other nasa centers and international partners to prepare for processing prior to launch on board the space shuttles ksc utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22  missions in the  to gather expectations of iss processing these experiences were incorporated into the design of the   sspf  which began construction in 1993 the space station directorate formed in 1996 ksc personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes from 1997 to 2007 ksc planned and performed   three multi-element integration testing  meit  sessions and the integration systems test  ist  numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on-orbit today ksc continues to process iss payloads from across the world prior to launch along with developing its own experiments for on orbit current programs and initiatives 
the following are current programs and initiatives at kennedy space center

since ksc s formation ten nasa officials have served as directors including three former astronauts  crippen bridges and cabana 

labor force 
when ksc separated from  in july 1962 it took 375 employees with it in may 1965 ksc had 7,000 employees and contractors move from rented space in cocoa beach to the new merritt island facilities the peak number of persons working on center was 26,000 in 1968  3,000 were civil servants  in 1970  announced intent to reduce cost of space operations and major cuts occurred at ksc by 1974 ksc s workforce was down to 10,000 employees  2,408 civil servants  a total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011 approximately 2,100 are employees of the federal government  the rest are contractors the average annual salary for an on-site worker in 2008 was  77,235 the end of the space shuttle program in 2011 preceded by the cancellation of  in 2010 produced a significant downsizing of the ksc workforce similar to that experienced at the end of the apollo program in 1972 as part of this downsizing 6,000 contractors lost their jobs at the center during 2010 and 2011 see also
