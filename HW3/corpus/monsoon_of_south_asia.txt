definition 
the word monsoon  derived from the arabic  mausam  meaning  season  although generally defined as a system of  characterized by a seasonal reversal of direction lacks a consistent detailed definition some examples are 

the  calls it a name for seasonal winds first applied to the winds blowing over the  from the northeast for six months and from the southwest for six months the term has since been extended to similar winds in other parts of the world the   ipcc  describes a monsoon as a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both surface winds and associated  caused by differential heating between a continental-scale land mass and the adjacent ocean the  defines it as the seasonal reversal of the direction of winds along the shores of the  especially in the arabian sea which blow from the southwest for half of the year and from the northeast for the other half colin stokes ramage in monsoon meteorology defines the monsoon as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation 
background 
observed initially by sailors in the arabian sea traveling between   and  the monsoon can be categorized into two branches based on their spread over the subcontinent

southwest monsoon clouds over  

alternatively it can be categorized into two segments based on the direction of rain-bearing winds 

southwest  sw  monsoon
northeast  ne  monsoon

based on the time of year that these winds bring rain to india the monsoon can also be categorized into two periods 

summer monsoon  may to september 
winter monsoon  october to november 

the complexity of the monsoon of south asia is not completely understood making it difficult to accurately predict the quantity timing and geographic distribution of the accompanying precipitation these are the most monitored components of the monsoon and they determine the water availability in india for any given year mechanism of the monsoon

monsoon over india


monsoons typically occur in tropical areas one area that monsoons impact greatly is india in india monsoons create an entire season in which the winds reverse completely various atmospheric conditions influence the monsoon winds the first condition is the differential heating and cooling of land and water this creates low pressure on the landmass while high pressure is created over the seas around during daytime but is reversed during the nighttime the second condition is the shift in the position of   itcz  in summer the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5n of the equator moves over the ganga plain creating a monsoon trough during the monsoon season the third condition is the presence of the high-pressure area that develops east of madagascar it is approximately at 20s over the indian ocean the intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the indian monsoon the fourth condition develops during the summer the tibetan plateau gets intensely heated resulting in strong vertical air currents and high pressure over the plateau about 9km above sea level the fifth condition develops during the summer due to the movement of the westerly jet streams to the north of the himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the indian peninsula changes in pressure over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons in certain years there is a reversal in the pressure conditions this periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the southern oscillation or so the southern oscillation is connected to el nino which is a warm ocean current that flows past the peruvian coast it flows every two to five years in place of the cold peruvian current the phenomenon is referred to as enso  el nino southern oscillations  in india the monsoon lasts for 100 to 120 days from early june and to mid-september the monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature and not steady the monsoon arrives with a sudden downpour of rainfall that continues for several days this is known as the burst of the monsoon the rainfall is a result of the convergence of wind flow from the  and reverse winds from the  the  of the monsoon occurs over the  in may arriving at the  by june and then the winds move towards the  by early september the monsoon starts to withdraw or retreat and is a more gradual process by mid-october it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula the withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of december to the first week of january this is the start of the winter season the retreating monsoon winds move over the arabian sea and the bay of bengal and collect moisture on the way these monsoon winds reach the southern states of india by october and are responsible for a second round of rainfall these are called the winter monsoons the winter monsoon is experienced in the states of karnataka tamil nadu kerala and andhra pradesh in the first week of january effect of geographical relief features 
although the southwest and northeast monsoon winds are seasonally reversible they do not cause precipitation on their own main article  
two factors are essential for  




additionally one of the  must happen in the case of the monsoon the cause is primarily  due to the presence of highlands in the path of the winds orographic barriers force wind to rise precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of  and condensation of the moist rising air main article  
the unique  features of the indian subcontinent come into play in allowing all of the above factors to occur simultaneously the relevant features in explaining the monsoon mechanism are as follows 

the presence of abundant water bodies around the subcontinent  the   and  these help moisture accumulate in the winds during the hot season the presence of abundant highlands like the  and the  right across the path of the southwest monsoon winds these are the main cause of the substantial  throughout the subcontinent 
the western ghats are the first highlands of india that the southwest monsoon winds encounter the western ghats rise abruptly from the  of the subcontinent making effective orographic barriers for the monsoon winds the himalayas play more than the role of orographic barriers for the monsoon they also help confine it to the subcontinent without them the southwest monsoon winds would blow right over the indian subcontinent into   and  without causing any rain for the northeast monsoon the highlands of the  play the role of orographic barrier

features of monsoon rains 
there are some unique features of the rains that the monsoon brings to the indian subcontinent  bursting 




 monsoon burst  over  

bursting of monsoon refers to the sudden change in weather conditions in india  typically from hot and dry weather to wet and humid weather during the southwest monsoon  characterized by an abrupt rise in the mean daily rainfall similarly the burst of the northeast monsoon refers to an abrupt increase in the mean daily rainfall over the affected regions rain variability  vagaries 
one of the most commonly used words to describe the erratic nature of the monsoon is  vagaries  used in newspapers magazines books  to  plans and india s budget discussions in some years it rains too much causing floods in parts of india  in others it rains too little or not at all causing droughts in some years the rain quantity is sufficient but its timing arbitrary sometimes despite average annual rainfall the daily distribution or geographic distribution of the rain is substantially skewed in the recent past rainfall variability in short time periods  about a week  were attributed to desert dust over the arabian sea and  ideal and normal monsoon rains 




annual average rainfall in india 

normally the southwest monsoon can be expected to  burst  onto the western coast of india  near   at the beginning of june and to cover the entire country by mid-july its withdrawal from india typically starts at the beginning of september and finishes by the beginning of october the northeast monsoon usually  bursts  around the 20th of october and lasts for about 50 days before withdrawing however a rainy monsoon is not necessarily a normal monsoon  that is one that performs close to  calculated over a long period a normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the average quantity of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence  mean spatial distribution  and over the entire expected time period  mean temporal distribution  additionally the arrival date and the departure date of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates the exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the  with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables a monsoon with excess rain can cause floods and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought  and economic losses therefore a normal monsoon with mean performance is the most desirable monsoon theories for mechanism of monsoon 
theories of the mechanism of the monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timing of their reversal traditional theory 
main article  
because of differences in the  of land and water  heat up faster than  consequently the  above  lands heats up faster than the air above seas this creates areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands this is known as  process of monsoon creation

also known as the thermal theory or the differential heating of sea and land theory the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale  it states that during the hot subtropical summers the massive  of the  heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas resulting in a  from south to north this causes the flow of moisture-laden winds from sea to land on reaching land these winds rise because of the geographical relief cooling  and leading to orographic rains this is the southwest monsoon the reverse happens during the winter when the land is colder than the sea establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea this causes the winds to blow over the indian subcontinent toward the  in a northeasterly direction causing the northeast monsoon because the southwest monsoon flows from sea to land it carries more moisture and therefore causes more rain than the northeast monsoon only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the bay of bengal picks up moisture causing rain in  and  during the winter months however many meteorologists argue that the monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory but a general weather phenomenon along the entire  of  this criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds but casts it as one of several factors rather than the only one dynamic theory 




the atmospheric circulation system with associated pressure belts and latitudes

the  of the  arise because of the difference in pressure at various  and act as means for distribution of  on the planet this pressure difference is because of the differences in  received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the  alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the  the two  the  and  circles and the two  giving rise to the  the  and the  however geophysical factors like  its rotation and its  cause these belts to shift gradually north and south following the  s seasonal shifts process of monsoon creation 
the dynamic theory explains the monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds according to this theory the monsoon is a result of the shift of the   itcz  under the influence of the  though the mean position of the itcz is taken as the equator it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the tropics of  and  during the  of the respective hemispheres   and   as such during the northern summer  may and june  the itcz moves north along with the vertical sun toward the tropic of cancer the itcz as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region is the target destination for the  of both hemispheres consequently with the itcz at the tropic of cancer the southeast trade winds of the southern hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it however because of the   which causes winds in the northern hemisphere to turn right whereas winds in the southern hemisphere turn left  these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the  transforming into southwest trades these pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the indian peninsula this results in the southwest monsoon the dynamic theory explains the monsoon as a global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one and when coupled with the traditional theory  based on the heating of sea and land  it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with orographic barriers jet stream theory 
main article  




jet streams of earth


this theory tries to explain the establishment of the northeast and southwest monsoons as well as unique features like  bursting  and variability the jet streams are systems of upper-air westerlies they give rise to slowly moving upper-air waves with 250 winds in some air streams first observed by  pilots they develop just below the  over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface the main types are the polar jets the subtropical westerly jets and the less common tropical easterly jets they follow the principle of  process of monsoon creation 




the  lies north of the  

over india a subtropical westerly jet develops in the winter season and is replaced by the tropical easterly jet in the summer season the high temperature during the summer over the  as well as over  in general is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the tropical easterly jet over india the mechanism affecting the monsoon is that the westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter this results in the north-to-south flow of the winds in the form of the northeast monsoon with the northward shift of the vertical sun this jet shifts north too the intense heat over the tibetan plateau coupled with associated  features like the high altitude of the plateau generate the tropical easterly jet over central india this jet creates a low-pressure zone over the  influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon theories for  bursting 
the  bursting  of the monsoon is primarily explained by the jet stream theory and the dynamic theory dynamic theory 
according to this theory during the summer months in the northern hemisphere the itcz shifts north pulling the southwest monsoon winds onto the land from the sea however the huge landmass of the himalayas restricts the low-pressure zone onto the himalayas themselves it is only when the tibetan plateau heats up significantly more than the himalayas that the itcz abruptly and swiftly shifts north leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the indian subcontinent the reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds leading to a second minor burst of rainfall over the eastern indian peninsula during the northern hemisphere winter months jet stream theory 
according to this theory the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of india toward the tibetan plateau this shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months the northward shift is not a slow and gradual process as expected for most changes in weather pattern the primary cause is believed to be the height of the himalayas as the tibetan plateau heats up the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north because of the lofty himalayas the westerly jet s movement is inhibited but with continuous dropping pressure sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the himalayas after a significant period as such the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the indian plains the reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon theories for monsoon variability
the jet stream theory also explains the variability in timing and strength of the monsoon timing  a timely northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet at the beginning of summer is critical to the onset of the southwest monsoon over india if the shift is delayed so is the southwest monsoon an early shift results in an early monsoon strength  the strength of the southwest monsoon is determined by the strength of the easterly tropical jet over central india a strong easterly tropical jet results in a strong southwest monsoon over central india and a weak jet results in a weak monsoon el nio-southern oscillation effect

effects of  on the weather of the subcontinent 

 is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of  that replaces the usual cold  the warm surface water moving toward the coast of peru with el nio is pushed west by the trade winds thereby raising the temperature of the southern pacific ocean the reverse condition is known as  southern oscillation a phenomenon first observed by  director general of observatories in india refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between  and  australia walker noticed that when pressure was high in tahiti it was low in darwin and  a southern oscillation index  soi  based on the pressure difference between tahiti and darwin has been formulated by the  to measure the strength of the oscillation walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the indian subcontinent was often negligible in years of high pressure over darwin  and low pressure over tahiti  conversely low pressure over darwin bodes well for precipitation quantity in india thus walker established the relationship between southern oscillation and quantities of monsoon rains in india ultimately the southern oscillation was found to be simply an atmospheric component of the el nio la nia effect which happens in the ocean therefore in the context of the monsoon the two together came to be known as the el nio-southern oscillation  enso  effect the effect is known to have a pronounced influence on the strength of the southwest monsoon over india with the monsoon being weak  causing droughts  during el nio years while la nia years bring particularly strong monsoons indian ocean dipole effect 
main article  
although the enso effect was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in india in recent decades its relationship with the indian monsoon seemed to weaken for example the strong enso of 1997 did not cause drought in india however it was later discovered that just like enso in the pacific ocean a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere system in the  was also in play this system was discovered in 1999 and named the   iod  an index to calculate it was also formulated iod develops in the equatorial region of the indian ocean from april to may and peaks in october with a positive iod winds over the indian ocean blow from east to west this makes the arabian sea  the western indian ocean near the african coast  much warmer and the eastern indian ocean around indonesia colder and drier in negative dipole years the reverse happens making indonesia much warmer and rainier a positive iod index often negates the effect of enso resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983 1994 and 1997 further the two poles of the iod  the eastern pole  around indonesia  and the western pole  off the african coast   independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon rains equatorial indian ocean oscillation 
as with enso the atmospheric component of the iod was later discovered and the cumulative phenomenon named equatorial indian ocean oscillation  equinoo  when equinoo effects are factored in certain failed forecasts like the acute drought of 2002 can be further accounted for the relationship between extremes of the indian summer monsoon rainfall along with enso and equinoo have been studied and models to better predict the quantity of monsoon rains have been statistically derived impact of climate change on the monsoon 
since 1950s the south asian summer monsoon underwent a gradual decline with a reduction of up to 10 over central india this is primarily due to a weakening monsoon circulation as a result of the rapid warming in the indian ocean and changes in land use and land cover since the strength of the monsoon is partially dependent on the temperature difference between the ocean and the land higher ocean temperatures in the indian ocean have weakened the moisture bearing winds from the ocean to the land the reduction in the summer monsoon rainfall have grave consequences over central india because at least 60 of the agriculture in this region is still largely  a recent assessment of the monsoonal changes indicate that the land warming has increased during 2002-2014 possibly reviving the strength of the monsoon circulation and rainfall future changes in the monsoon will depend on a competition between land and oceanon which is warming faster than the other meanwhile there has been a three-fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events during the years 1950 to 2015 over the entire central belt of india leading to a steady rise in the number of flash floods with significant socioeconomic losses widespread extreme rainfall events are those rainfall events which are larger than 150 mm day and spread over a region large enough to cause floods monsoon rain prediction models 
since the  in india various attempts have been made to predict monsoon rainfall at least five prediction models exist seasonal prediction of indian monsoon  spim 
the   cdac  at  facilitated the seasonal prediction of indian monsoon  spim  experiment on the  padma supercomputing system this project involved simulated runs of historical data from 1985 to 2004 to try to establish the relationship of five atmospheric general circulation models with monsoon rainfall distribution indian meteorological department model 
the department has tried to forecast the monsoon for india since 1884 and is the only official agency entrusted with making public forecasts about the quantity distribution and timing of the monsoon rains its position as the sole authority on the monsoon was cemented in 2005 by the   in 2003 imd substantially changed its forecast methodology model and administration a sixteen-parameter monsoon forecasting model used since 1988 was replaced in 2003 however following the 2009 drought in india  worst since 1972  the department decided in 2010 that it needed to develop an  indigenous model  to further improve its prediction capabilities significance

the monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for  in the indian subcontinent as such it affects the   and associated flora fauna and   agriculture society hydro-power production and geography of the subcontinent  like the availability of fresh water in water bodies and the underground water table  with all of these factors cumulatively contributing to the health of the economy of affected countries the monsoon turns large parts of india from semi-deserts into green grasslands see photos taken only three months apart in the western ghats geographical  wettest spots on earth 
 and  both in the indian state of  alternate as the wettest places on earth given the quantity of their rainfall though there are other cities with similar claims they receive more than 11,000 millimeters of rain each from the monsoon agricultural 
in india which has historically had a primarily agrarian economy the  recently overtook the  in terms of  contribution however the  sector still contributes 17-20 of gdp and is the largest employer in the country with about 60 of indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood about 49 of india s land is agricultural  that number rises to 55 if associated   areas etc are included because more than half of these farmlands are rain-fed the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation agricultural dependence on the monsoon remains far from insignificant therefore the agricultural calendar of india is governed by the monsoon any fluctuations in the time distribution spatial distribution or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts causing the agricultural sector to suffer this has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors the overall economy food inflation and therefore the general population s quality and cost of living economic 
the economic significance of the monsoon is aptly described by  s remark that the monsoon is the  real finance minister of india  a good monsoon results in better agricultural yields which brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces imports thus reducing  overall better rains also result in increased hydroelectric production all of these factors have positive ripple effects throughout the economy of india the down side however is that when monsoon rains are weak crop production is low leading to higher food prices with limited supply as a result the indian government is actively working with farmers and the nation s meteorological department to produce more drought resistant crops social 
  emphasized during a quarterly review of india s  that the lives of indians depend on the performance of the monsoon his own career prospects his emotional well-being and the performance of his monetary policy are all  a hostage  to the monsoon he said as is the case for most indians additionally farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities this crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city life travel 
in the past indians usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons but with the advent of globalization such travel is gaining popularity places like  and the western ghats get a large number of tourists both local and foreigners during the monsoon season kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in  treatments and massage therapy one major drawback of traveling during the monsoon is that most wildlife sanctuaries are closed also some mountainous areas especially in himalayan regions get cut off when roads are damaged by landslides and floods during heavy rains environmental 
the monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to the area the  are mostly rain-fed and non-perennial in nature depending primarily on the monsoon for water supply most of the  are also rain-fed and monsoon-dependent as such the flora fauna and entire  of these areas rely heavily on the monsoon

notes 


 the name of the wind is based on the direction that it blows from southwest winds blow onto the land from the southwest northeast winds flow from the northeast toward the southwest onto the land  the  mountains also lie in the path of the southwest monsoon but do not result in much precipitation because they are in the direction of the path of the southwest winds and not across them causing no  of the winds  other major highlands like the   and  that play active roles in the monsoon are considered major extensions of the western ghats and are thus not discussed separately  first the himalayas serve as orographic barriers to the southwest monsoon winds second they help confine the winds to the subcontinent hampering their northward progress third they contribute to the convergence of the bay of bengal branch and arabian sea branch of the southwest monsoon winds increasing the intensity of precipitation over the northern part of the subcontinent fourth they are a major factor in the bursting of the monsoon under the jet stream theory fifth they help determine the direction of the bay of bengal branch of the northeast monsoon their role is still a matter of active study and understanding of them is evolving regularly  when the southeast trade winds cross the equator they are perceived in the northern hemisphere as equatorial westerlies because they seem to blow from the equator toward the tropic of cancer similarly when the itcz is at the tropic of cancer the northeast trade winds are confined to the area north of the tropic of cancer  change of direction or origin of winds alters their nomenclature as noted above  geostrophic winds blow parallel to the  and keep low-pressure zones to their left in the northern hemisphere and to their right in the southern hemisphere the reversal is a result of the
