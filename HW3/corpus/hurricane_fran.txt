hurricane fran originated from a  that moved off the western coast of africa entering the atlantic ocean on august22 1996 not long after moving over water   formed around a developing  ships in the vicinity of the system confirmed that a surface circulation had formed later that day after further development the   nhc  initiated advisories on the system around 8 00am  on august23 designating it as tropical depression six at this time the depression was situated to the southeast of the  over the following several days little development took place as the system moved westward at 17mph  27km h  the westward motion and lack of development were attributed to the low-level inflow from  located roughly 850mi  1,370km  west-northwest of the depression by august26 the depression had become significantly disorganized prompting the nhc to issue their initial final advisory on the system the following day satellite imagery depicted an improved circulation leading to the re-issuance of advisories however post-storm analysis indicated that the system maintained tropical depression status during the 24hour span during the afternoon of august27 the depression intensified further becoming a tropical storm and receiving the name fran at this time tropical storm fran was located about 1,000mi  1,600km  east of the  following a similar track as edouard the newly named storm maintained a west-northwest track while gaining strength

following the development of deep convection around fran s center of circulation on august29 the nhc upgraded it to a  hurricane the lowest ranking on the  with winds of 75mph  120km h  however the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on august30 as it became less organized possibly due to an interaction with  to the north during this time the forward motion of the storm significantly decreased and it took a more northwestward track however this weakening was short-lived and fran re-attained hurricane status the following day as edouard moved towards the  the storm also resumed its west-northwest movement as a   to the north strengthened
