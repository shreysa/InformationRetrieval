the   nhc  began monitoring two  on september 13 the easternmost wave quickly spun up into what would become  while the western one continued moving generally westward with generally favorable conditions in the disturbance s path development into a tropical cyclone seemed likely during those two days the disturbance became better organized and by september 16  became established around a poorly organized circulation as the system was an imminent threat to land despite the center not being well-defined the nhc initiated advisories on it as  potential tropical cyclone fifteen  at 15 00utc in accordance with a policy change enacted at the start of the season a mid-level  anchored north of the disturbance steered it generally west-northwest into a region highly favorable for   of 84f  29c  low  and ample moisture were anticipated to foster strengthening to hurricane-status before the system reached the  as the disturbance continued to grow increasingly well-defined throughout the day it was later upgraded to a moderate-range tropical storm  based on satellite estimates  at 21 00utc that day  maria at that time maria was situated 620mi  1,000km  east-southeast of the lesser antilles 
a  and favorable  developed atop the center of circulation which enabled maria to become further organized throughout the early morning hours of september 17 after a brief intrusion of dry air exposed the circulation a convective burst occurred over the center and intensification resumed  investigating the system observed surface winds of 74mph  119km h  and a formative  feature accordingly the nhc upgraded maria to hurricane status at 21 00utc expansion of the central dense overcast and an increasingly complete eyewall signaled steady intensification throughout the overnight of september1718 considerable  activity was identified within the hurricane s core early on september 18 and statistical models indicated a high probability of  explosive strengthening took place shortly thereafter with aircraft reconnaissance finding surface winds of 120mph  195km h  and a central pressure of 959mbar  hpa  28.32inhg  making maria a category3 hurricane on the  and hence a major hurricane additionally radar data revealed a well-defined 12mi  19km  wide eye the eye contracted slightly to 9mi  14km  as intensification continued and the system reached category4 strength by 21 00utc

rapid intensification culminated late on september 18 with maria achieving category5 status just 15mi  25km  east-southeast of dominica hurricane hunters observed surface winds of 160mph  260km h  and a pressure of 925mbar  hpa  27.32inhg  at this time maria made  in dominica at 01 15utc on september 19 becoming the first category5 hurricane on record to strike the island nation interaction with the mountains of dominica imparted slight weakening of the hurricane to category4  however once over the  maria regained category5 intensity additional strengthening took place as the storm tracked northwest toward  despite the formation of concentric eyewallsthe larger one spanning 25 to 35mi  40 to 56km  and the smaller only 5mi  8.0km  signalling the start of an the inner violent core remained undisrupted through the afternoon maria attained its peak intensity around 04 00utc on september 20 roughly 30mi  45km  south of  sustained winds reached 175mph  280km h  and its central pressure bottomed out at 908mbar  hpa  26.85inhg  this ranks it as the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane since reliable records began

the hurricane made its closest approach to st croix around 05 00utc on september 20 passing within 20mi  30km  of the island  the storm s outer eyewall lashed the island while the more violent inner eye remained offshore hours later around 08 00utc the outer eyewall struck  an island off the eastern coast of puerto rico by this time the outer eye became dominant as the inner one decayed and the eyewall replacement cycle caused maria to weaken to category4 strength maria made landfall just south of  puerto rico around 10 15utc with sustained winds of 155mph  250km h  making it the strongest to hit the island since the  maria maintained a general west-northwest course across puerto rico emerging over the atlantic ocean shortly before 18 00utc interaction with the mountainous terrain resulted in substantial weakening  sustained winds fell to 110mph  175km h  and the central pressure rose to 957mbars  hpa  28.26inhg  with favorable environmental conditions maria steadily reorganized as it moved away from puerto rico a large eye 45mi  75km  wide developed with deep convection blossoming around it early on september 21 the system regained category3 intensity initially cooler waters  by  two weeks prior limited maria s reorganization during the afternoon of september 21 the system traversed the  and  banks north of the    from the region s shallow waters temporarily interfered with measurements of surface winds convection around the storm s eye deepened and its eye became better defined that night and the hurricane reached a tertiary peak with sustained winds of 125mph  205km h  an increase in southwesterly wind shear prompted gradual weakening of the hurricane starting with restriction of banding features and later degradation of the eyewall late on september 22 the hurricane turned north-northwest as it reached the western periphery of the ridge previously steering it northwest maria fluctuated in organization throughout september 23 with its eye periodically clearing and becoming cloud-filled  it maintained category3 hurricane strength during this phase despite a decreasing central pressure the storm finally weakened to category2 strength early on september 24 hurricane hunters observed flight-level winds of 116 to 135mph  187 to 217km h  however surface wind returns by the noaa s  were only 90mph  150km h  this indicated below-average mixing down of winds aloft by this time maria s trajectory shifted almost due north between the aforementioned ridge and a  over the eastern  weakening accelerated later on september 24 into september 25 as the hurricane traversed a cold wakewith sea surface temperatures of 7577f  2425c created by  a week prior maria degraded to category1 strength during this time early on september 25 maria s structure changed dramatically as its inner-core collapsed the low-level circulation became exposed to the northwest and most of the deep convection shifted to the eastern half of the storm maria further weakened into a tropical storm during the late afternoon of september 26 however a sustained convective burst resulted in maria s winds increasing to hurricane-force once again on september 27 with banding features evident on the eastern part of the circulation despite this northwesterly wind shear continued to impinge on the storm and maria once again weakened to a tropical storm early on september 28 simultaneously maria began to accelerate to the east-northeast as it became embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies gradually weakening maria soon began to move over sea surface temperatures of 73f  23c  and below causing most of its convection to dissipate late on september 30 maria transitioned into an  during the next couple of days maria s remnant accelerated towards the  while rapidly weakening maria s remnants later crossed the  into the western  on october 3 before being absorbed by another frontal system later on the same day

a rally for victims of the hurricane and puerto rico s status in general took place in  on october3


on october 3 2017 president trump visited puerto rico he compared the damage from hurricane maria to that of  saying   if you looked  every death is a horror but if you look at a real catastrophe like katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overbearing nobody has seen anything like this    what is your death count as of this morning 17  trump s remarks were widely criticized for implying that hurricane maria was not a  real catastrophe  while in puerto rico trump also distributed canned goods and paper towels to crowds gathered at a relief shelter and told the residents of the devastated island  i hate to tell you puerto rico but you ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we ve spent a lot of money on puerto rico and that s fine we saved a lot of lives 
on october 12 trump tweeted  we cannot keep fema the military   the first responders who have been amazing  under the most difficult circumstances  in p.r forever  prompting further criticism from lawmakers in both parties  mayor cruz replied  you are incapable of empathy and frankly simply cannot get the job done  in response to a request for clarification on the tweet from governor rossell  assured that no resources were being pulled and replied   our country will stand with those american citizens in puerto rico until the job is done
