the organization 
the world meteorological organization  wmo  is a specialized agency of the united nations it is the un system s authoritative voice on the state and behavior of the earth s atmosphere its interaction with the oceans the climate it produces and the resulting distribution of  wmo has a membership of  as of february 2014 the  was signed 11 october 1947 and established upon ratification on 23 march 1950 wmo became the specialized agency of the united nations in 1951 for meteorology  weather and climate  operational  and related geophysical sciences it originated from the   imo  which was founded in 1873 the wmo hierarchy 

the  the supreme body of the organization determines policy each member state and territory is represented by a permanent representative with wmo when congress meets every four years congress elects the president and vice-presidents of the organization and members of the executive council  and appoints the secretary-general the executive council  ec  implements congress decisions it coordinates programmes manages the budget considers and acts on resolutions and recommendations from the regional associations and technical commissions and studies and makes recommendations on matters affecting international meteorology and related activities the executive council normally hold a session at least once a year six regional associations  ra  are responsible for the coordination of meteorological hydrological and related activities within their respective regions they meet once every four years and elect a president and vice-president the president of each regional association is an ex officio member of the executive council  are responsible for studying meteorological and hydrological operational systems applications and research they establish methodology and procedures and make recommendations to executive council and the world meteorological congress  is headed by the secretary-general who is appointed by the world meteorological congress for a four-year term with a maximum tenure of 8 years the secretary-general appoints all staff including the deputy secretary-general and the assistant secretary-general the secretariat currently has around 300 staff

weather climate and the  shape almost every aspect of our lives they can be benevolent and bring abundance and well-being but they can also be dangerous and cause great damage  weather climate and water-related hazards account for nearly 90 of  natural  disasters these powerful natural forces do not recognize national borders thus global and regional cooperation is essential global data are needed to understand the behaviour of the earths atmosphere and its interaction with the land and oceans  whether it be to predict next weeks weather or next years climate forecasters must have timely quality-assured standardized information coming from all corners of the world even the accuracy of a two-day weather forecast relies on observations from far beyond national borders the world meteorological organization provides the framework for this essential international cooperation among the national meteorological and hydrological services of its 191 member states and territories weather 
thanks to the international coordination efforts of wmo national meteorological and hydrological services provide daily weather forecasts and early and reliable warnings of high-impact weather and climate events these warnings help to save countless lives and to protect property and the environment from damage they contribute to economic planning and decision-making and help minimize the harm that weather climate and water hazards can cause to socioeconomic development the organization also fosters collaboration between the national meteorological and hydrological services to furthers the application of meteorology to public weather services agriculture aviation shipping energy water resource management and many other economic sectors the first step in producing weather forecasts is to gather non-stop observations of the environment from around the world millions of observations are gathered worldwide every day by over 50 satellites 400 moored buoys 1 250 drifting buoys 4 000 aircraft from around 40 commercial aircraft companies 7 300 ships and 10 000 land-based observing stations wmo develops the technical standards for designing these and other observing instruments and for ensuring that the collected data are quality controlled and comparable data that pass the test are fed into the complex numerical weather prediction models that national meteorological services use to produce weather forecasts early warnings of storms and other natural hazards air-quality forecasts climate predictions and risk assessments these forecasts and related products are broadcast in real time to the public and myriads of users worldwide this enables governments to provide reliable and effective weather services to protect lives and property and ensure sustainable economic development and the general welfare of their citizens to achieve these objectives wmo advocates for broad open data policies and maintains standardized data and exchange mechanisms it also collaborates on the development of innovative data collection and delivery systems climate 
the stations of the wmo global atmosphere watch play a vital role in detecting climate variability and change by monitoring long-term changes in levels of greenhouse gases solar radiation and other atmospheric components to assess their effects on people climate regional and urban air quality and marine and terrestrial ecosystems they project the magnitude and rate of climate change and related impacts such as sea-level rise wmo publishes an annual  with details on atmospheric concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide the wmo-led   gfcs  guides the development of science-based climate information and services to support decision-making in climate-sensitive sectors gfcs coordinates actions at the national regional and global levels to enhance the quality quantity and use of climate services climate information empowers countries to implement the  on climate change and promotes sustainable development the gfcs enables public and private-sector decision-makers to plan and adapt their activities and projects in anticipation of changing conditions seasonal climate forecasts in particular are increasingly used for agriculture and food security disaster risk reduction energy public health water resources and other sectors the annually published  provides details of global regional and national temperatures and extreme weather events it also provides information on long-term climate change indicators include atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases sea level rise and sea ice extent the year 2016 was the hottest year on record with many weather and climate extremes according to the most recent wmo report the world meteorological organization further supports climate change assessments by providing data and models and by hosting and co-sponsoring the   ipcc  the   gcos  and the   wcrp  water 
water is essential for the production of virtually all of our goods and services it is the most important and widely used source of renewable energy  hydropower represents approximately 16 of total electricity production worldwide the world meteorological organization promotes water-resource assessments by national hydrological services which in turn provide the forecasts needed to plan water storage for domestic requirements agricultural activities hydroelectric power gener ation and urban development the organization also assists national hydrological services to establish and maintain systems for acquiring and disseminating accurate and timely information on the water cycle for formulating integrated water-resource management strategies equipped with better hydrological information assessments and forecasts countries are able to independently assess their water resources and respond to threats of floods and drought wmo strategic plan 
the  sets the directions and priorities to guide the activities of members and constituent bodies to enable the improvement of their core information products and services to maintain necessary infrastructures and to directly benefit from advancements in science and technology this plan emphasizes the following key priorities 

disaster risk reduction
the global framework for climate services  gfcs 
the wmo integrated global observing system  wigos 
aviation meteorological services
polar and high mountain regions
capacity development
governance

contributions to sustainable development goals 
the  serves as the centerpiece for national and international policymaking over the next 15 years it sets out 17 sustainable development goals  sdgs  that the wmo community can contribute to at the national and international levels national meteorological and hydrological services  nmhss  can benefit from the status of wmo as a specialized agency of the un to engage with the 2030 agenda they can also draw on the partnerships that the wmo community continues to build with other communities sectors and disciplines for example through national climate services and the  as policymakers and the general public gain a better understand of the  national meteorological and hydrological services can look forward to establishing an even stronger role in protecting life and property and in building weather and climate resilience meteorological codes 
in keeping with its mandate to promote the standardization of meteorological observations the wmo maintains numerous code forms for the representation and exchange of meteorological oceanographical and hydrological data the traditional code forms such as   and  are character-based and their coding is position-based newer wmo code forms are designed for portability extensibility and universality these are  crex and for gridded geo-positioned data  
the wmo and   unep  jointly created   ipcc  received the  in 2007  for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about   man-made  climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
