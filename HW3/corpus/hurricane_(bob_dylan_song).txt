background 
carter and a man named john artis had been charged with a triple  at the lafayette grill in  in 1966 the following year carter and artis were found guilty of the murders which were widely reported as racially motivated in the years that followed a substantial amount of controversy emerged over the case ranging from allegations of faulty evidence and questionable eyewitness testimony to an unfair trial in his autobiography carter maintained his innocence and after reading it dylan visited him in  in    dylan had written topical ballads such as   and bob wasn t sure that he could write a song  he was just filled with all these feelings about hurricane he couldn t make the first step i think the first step was putting the song in a total storytelling mode i don t remember whose idea it was to do that but really the beginning of the song is like stage directions like what you would read in a script   pistol shots ring out in a barroom night here comes the story of the hurricane  boom  titles you know bob loves movies and he can write these movies that take place in eight to ten minutes yet seem as full or fuller than regular movies  after meeting with carter in prison and later with a group of his supporters dylan began to write  hurricane  the song was one of his few   during the 1970s and proved to be his fourth most successful single of the decade reaching  33 on the  controversy and re-recording 
dylan first recorded the song in late july 1975  it featured  on  and  on  bellzouki  dylan was forced to re-record the song with altered lyrics in october 1975 after concerns were raised by  s lawyers that references to alfred bello and arthur dexter bradley  the two star witnesses of the case  as having  robbed the bodies  could result in a lawsuit bello and bradley had never been accused of such acts because there was too much leakage on the multitracks to make a vocal  punch in  dylan decided to re-record the entire song at this time he was already rehearsing for his upcoming tour and the musicians from the  were still at his disposal dylan took violinist rivera guitarist steven soles bassist rob rothstein drummer howie wyeth and percussionist luther rix back into the studio and a new faster version of  hurricane  was recorded with don devito again producing and  providing a harmony vocal  there is a noticeable mistake in the 8-minute recording at 4 02 where the backing singer  blakley  gets her line wrong she sings   remember you saw  said  you saw the getaway car  the final version of the song which runs over eight minutes was spliced together from two separate takes completed on october24 1975 even though some offending lyrics were removed the song still drew legal action from eyewitness patricia graham valentine who believed that it portrayed her as part of a conspiracy to frame carter however her lawsuit was dismissed by a  and the  affirmed the dismissal more generally even with the revised lyrics  hurricane  was accused of factual errors the song included a description of carter as the  number one contender  according to the may 1966 issue of  he was ranked ninth around the time of his arrest and had never been ranked higher than third reporters for the  a  newspaper published not far from the scene of the crime questioned dylan s objectivity at the time of the song s release and accused him of excessive poetic license dylan biographer  praised the song but noted  there was no reference to his antagonistic rhetoric criminal history or violent temper
