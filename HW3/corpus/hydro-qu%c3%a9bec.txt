19451959  beginnings and development 
in quebec advocates for the creation of a public hydroelectric utility protested against high costs poor  and the lack of french speakers in management positions in hydroelectricity companies in 1944  company was nationalised along with its subsidiary beauharnois power and hydro-qubec was created to manage the companies quebec premier  adopted a policy of investing 10 million dollars per year in rural electrification however in 1944 the government changed and the new premier  was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until 1960 and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydro-qubec mostly served the montreal area major projects included 

 completed in 1956 1,125 mw
 completed in 1959 845 mw
the  completed in 1961 1,903 mw  built 1959-1964 752 mw

between 1944 and 1962 hydro-qubec s installed capacity increased from 616 to 3,661 mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal area 19601979  the second nationalisation 




the spillway at the  can deal with a water flow twice as large as the saint lawrence river inaugurated in 1979 the 5,616 mw generating station was at the heart of a network of 8 hydroelectric stations known as the  

duplessis  conservative reign now known as the  ended when he died in office in 1959 the subsequent election of the  led by  marked the beginning of the  a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydro-qubec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in 1963 the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the  and the  hydro-qubec achieved province-wide scope all of the 46 rural coops accepted hydro-qubecs 1963 buyout offer except saint-jean-baptiste-de-rouville which still exists major projects during this period included 

manic-outardes project a 7-dam hydroelectric complex including the   1,145 mw    1,244 mw  and the   2,596 mw  originally named manic-2 manic-3 and manic-5 respectively because these stations were 700 kilometres away from the urban centers in southern quebec power was stepped up to 735 kv a world first led by engineer   5,428 mw the station is in  and the government of quebec refused to allow power to be transferred through quebec forcing the negotiation of a contract where hydro-qubec buys power from the project at 1969 prices until the year 2041 phase i of the  hydro-qubec worked with  to build the  equipped  which closed in 2012 
19801996  restructuring 
because of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early 1980s which led to structural changes at hydro-qubec it became a  whose sole shareholder is qubec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energy-related field in 1986 the  began bringing power from the james bay project 1,100 kilometers south to the boston area phase ii of the james bay project started in 1987 and took nine years to complete construction of the  began in 1994 1997present  renewed growth 
in the late  90s the wholesale electricity market opened up across north america and hydro-qubec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition both inside and outside its tranditional service area the u.s  granted hydro-qubec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices enabling hydro-qubec to expand its market hydro-qubec acquired a substantial share of  controller of natural gas distributor  to participate in that market in northeastern north america 



the rupert river diversion will channel part of the natural flow of the river  orange on the map  to the robert-bourassa reservoir 

in 2002 the  between the  and the quebec government made possible the development of the  the 5,000 million cad eastmain-1-a and sarcelle powerhouses and  diversion project this will provide water power to new turbines at eastmain-1 or eastmain-1-a and sarcelle powerhouses and will provide increased flow at the existing la grande-1 generating station as well as robert-bourassa or la grande-2-a output will be 918 mw other stations commissioned since 1997 are

in 1988 all of quebec and parts of  and  lost power because of an equipment failure at a substation on the  the  tripped  on the transmission network causing a nine-hour quebec-wide blackout in the  five days of  collapsed 600 kilometres  370mi  of  power lines and over 3,000 kilometres  1,900mi  of medium and  distribution lines in southern quebec up to 1.4 million customers were without power for up to five weeks corporate structure and financial results




hydro-qubec generation and main transmission network as of 2008 

like its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydro-qubec was reorganized in the late 1990s to comply with electricity  in the united states while still a  company hydro-qubec has created separate  dealing with the   and  aspects of the business the transmission division  was the first to be spun off in 1997 in response to the u.s  s publication of order 888 the restructuring was completed in the year 2000 with the adoption of bill 116 which amended the act respecting the rgie de l nergie to enact the functional separation of hydro-qubec s various business units this functional separation and the creation of a so-called  heritage pool    volume patrimonial  of electricity echoed a recommendation of a  study commissioned by the  government the january 2000 report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the  quebec social pact  namely low uniform and stable rates across the province  particularly in the residential sector  legislation passed in 2000 commits the generation division hydro-qubec production to provide the distribution division hydro-qubec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to 165 twh of energy plus ancillary servicesincluding an extra 13.9 twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of 34,342 mwat a set price of 2.79 per kwh order in council 1277-2001 specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the 8,760 hourly intervals which vary from 11,420 to 34,342 mw hydro-qubec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needsapproximately 8.2 twh in 2007  by calling for tenders for long-term contracts open to all suppliers including hydro-qubec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydro-qubec distribution launched calls for tenders in 2003 and 2005 for 1,000 and 2,000 mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in 2006 and the 23  under contract should be completely on-line by december 2015 the transnergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the rgie de l nergie du qubec  quebec energy board  an  established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a cost-of-service approach the rgie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distribution-related capital expenditure project exceeding c 10 million  approval of the terms of service and of long-term supply contracts  dealing with customer complaints  and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the  the generation division hydro-qubec production is not subject to regulation by the rgie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public hearing process conducted by the bureau d audiences publiques sur l environnement hydro-qubec employed 23,659 people in 2009 including 2,060 engineers making the company the largest employer of engineers in quebec 



financial results 

for the year ending on december 31 2011 hydro-qubec posted net earnings of c 2.611 billion up 3.8 from 2010 despite lower electricity prices on export markets and the high value of the   were down 3.8 in 2011 at c 12.392 billion while  amounted to c 7.284 billion down by c 159 million from 2010 mainly due to lower short-term electricity and fuel purchases and the repeal of quebec s capital tax the company has assets of c 69.637 billion c 56.901 billion of which are tangible assets its long-term debt stood at c 42.05 billion and the company reported a capitalization rate of 31.0 in 2011  issued by hydro-qubec are  by the quebec government on december 31 2011   of hydro-qubec were rated aa2 stable by  aa positive by  and a  by  in 2011 hydro-qubec paid a c 1.958 billion  to its sole shareholder the  between 2007 and 2011 the company paid a total of c 10.358 billion in dividends it took on  8b in debt during the same period privatization debate 




the  is a landmark of montreal s downtown 

in 1981 the  government redefined hydro-qubec s mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of 1944 the government issued itself 43,741,090 shares worth c 100 each and the amended statute stated that hydro-qubec would now pay up to 75 of its net earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydro-qubec act started an episodic debate on whether hydro-qubec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garciaboth associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institutehave often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower  without going as far as boyer and garcia  the head of the  briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydro-qubec during the  a  poll conducted in november 2008 found that a majority of quebec respondents  53  were opposed to his proposal to sell 7.5 of the company s  to quebec citizens and businesses while 38 were in favor commenting on the issue on  s  former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydro-qubec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydro-qubec is not for sale like many other economists yvan allaire from  business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the government s annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of  s  claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebec s natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices  for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vultures  left-wing academics such as  s lo-paul lauzon and gabriel sainte-marie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be short-selling itself by divesting of a choice asset for a minimal short term gain activities

the transnergie s network operates asynchronously from that of its neighbours on the  although quebec uses the same 60  frequency as the rest of north america its grid does not use the same phase as surrounding networks transnergie mainly relies on  converters to export or import electricity from other jurisdictions this feature of the quebec network allowed hydro-qubec to remain unscathed during the  with the exception of 5 hydro plants on the  radially connected to the ontario grid at the time a new 1250-mw back to back hvdc tie has been commissioned at the outaouais substation in  near the  border the new interconnection has been online since 2009 and the 315 kv line is fully operational since 2010 one drawback of the transnergie network involves the long distances separating the generation sites and the main consumer markets for instance the  substation links the james bay project plants to the nicolet station near  south of the saint lawrence over 1,200 kilometres  750mi  away investments 
in 2011 transnergie invested c 1.3 billion in capital expenditures including c 460 million to expand its network in addition to the new tie with ontario the company plans to build a new 1200-mw direct current link between the des cantons substation at  in quebec s  and  with an hvdc converter terminal built at  the us segment of the us 1.1 billion line would be built by northern pass transmission llc a partnership between   75  and   25  in order to go ahead the project must receive regulatory approval in quebec and the united states the proposed transmission line could be in operation in 2015 according to jim robb a senior executive from northeast utilities  could meet one third of its  commitments with the hydropower coming through this new power line alone distribution

the hydro-qubec quipement division acts as the company s main contractor on major construction sites with the exception of work conducted on the territory covered by the  which are assigned to the  subsidiary the construction of a complex of four hydroelectric generating stations on the romaine river  1,550 mw  began on may 13 2009 the plants are scheduled to be built and commissioned between 2014 and 2020 in his march 2009  quebec premier  announced that his government intends to further develop the province s hydroelectric potential the call for further development of hydroelectric and other renewable generating capacity has been implemented in the company s 2009-2013 strategic plan released on july 30 2009 hydro-qubec plans capacity upgrades at the   120 mw  and   210 mw  stations and a third unit at the sm-3 plant  440 mw  the company will also conduct technical and environmental studies and undertake consultations with local communities to build new facilities on the petit-mcatina  1,200 mw  and magpie  850 mw  rivers on the north shore and revive the tabaret project  132 mw  in the  region in western quebec international ventures 
hydro-qubec first forays outside its borders began in 1978 a new subsidiary hydro-qubec international was created to market the company s know-how abroad in the fields of distribution generation and transmission of electricity the new venture leveraged the existing pool of expertise in the parent company during the next 25 years hydro-qubec was particularly active abroad with investments in electricity transmission networks and generation  transelec in  the  in the  the consorcio transmantaro in  hidroelectrica rio lajas in   in  and the  in  it briefly held a 17 share in senelec  s electric utility when the senegalese government decided to sell part of the company to a consortium led by the french company elyo a subsidiary of  in 1999 the transaction was canceled in 2000 following the election of president  also in 1999 hydro-qubec international acquired a 20 stake in the meiya power company in  for c 83 million the company held this participation until july 2004 the company s expertise was sought by several hydroelectric developers throughout the world including the  where hydro s employees trained chinese engineers in the fields of management finance and dams hydro-qubec gradually withdrew from the international business between 2003 and 2006 and sold off all of its foreign investments for a profit proceeds from these sales were paid to the government s generations fund a trust fund set up by the province to alleviate the effect of public debt on future generations environment 




the   esox lucius  is more prevalent today in the  than it was before the flooding of the reservoir the increase of this population has been counterbalanced by a decline in the   stizostedion vitreum  population 

the construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydro-qubec s activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of  from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosion in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities since the early 1970s hydro-qubec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in 1972 the cancellation of champigny project a planned  plant in the  valley in 1973 and the james bay negotiations leading to the  in 1975 forced the company to reconsider its practices to address environmental concerns hydro-qubec established an environmental protection committee in 1970 and an environmental management unit in september 1973 its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific community effects on the natural environment 




the  population near major reservoirs in northern quebec has increased between 1970 and 2000 

in the late 1970s the company set up a network of 27 monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first 30 years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by 3 to 6 times over the first 5 to 10 years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after 20 to 30 years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a population s diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reduced-flow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir  zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the  have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded emissions of greenhouse gases  ghg  rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after 10 years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area fluctuate around 30,000 tonnes of co2 equivalent per twh of generated power hydro-qubec claims its hydroelectric plants release 35 times less ghg than comparable gas-fired plants and 70 times less than coal-fired ones and that they constitute the  option with the best performance  overall social effects and sustainable development

another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the  of the north shore and the  and  in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the 20th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the 1950s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the  some native communities particularly the crees have come to a point  where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south  notes an hydro-qubec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between 1970 and 2000 the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the 1990s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area  will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various players  after the strong rejection of the surot project and its subsequent cancellation in november 2004 hydro-qubec under the leadership of its new ceo  reaffirmed hydro-qubec s commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy since then hydro-qubec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company  projects must be cost effective environmentally acceptable and well received by the communities hydro-qubec has also taken part in a series of  initiatives since the late 1980s its approach is based on three principles  economic development social development and environmental protection since 2007 the company adheres to the  which governs the collection and publication of sustainability performance information the company employs 250 professionals and managers in the environmental field and has implemented ancertified environmental management system rates and customers

electric heating accounts for more than half of the electricity used by residential customers in quebec according to hydro-qubec 

the average consumption of residential and agricultural customers is relatively high at 16,857 kwh per year in 2011 because of the widespread use of electricity as the main source of   77  and   90  hydro-qubec estimates that heating accounts for more than one half of the electricity demand in the residential sector this preference for electric heating makes electricity demand more unpredictable but offers some environmental benefits despite quebec s very cold climate in winter  emissions in the residential sector accounted for only 5.5  4.65 mt co

the price of electricity for residences and farms includes a 40.64 daily subscription fee and two price levels depending on consumption the rates are all-included  power transmission and distribution costs but are subject to the   gst  and the   qst  as of april 1 2012 customers pay 5.32 kwh for the first 30 daily kwh while the remainder is sold at 7.51 kwh the average monthly bill for a residential customer was approximately c 100 in 2008 electric meter readings are usually conducted every two months and bills are bimonthly however the company offers an optional equalized payment plan allowing residential customers to pay their annual electricity costs in 12 monthly installments based on past consumption patterns of the current customer address and the average temperature in that location in 2007 hydro-qubec pulled out of a canadian government initiative to install  across the province stating that it would be  too costly to deliver real savings  since then hydro-qubec organized a 2-year pilot project involving 2,000 customers in 4 cities with  a report filed with the rgie de l nergie in the summer of 2010 concluded that the effect of  with three levels of pricing in the winter would lead to minimal load and energy savings the company intends to gradually phase-in   ami  between 2011 and 2017 early efforts will focus on meter data transfer connect-disconnect outage detection and theft reduction industrial customers

for more than a century industrial development in quebec has been stimulated by the abundance of hydroelectric resources energy represents a significant expenditure in the pulp and paper and aluminum sectors two industries with long-standing traditions in quebec in 2010 industrial customers purchased 68.4 twh from hydro-qubec representing 40.4 of all electricity sold by the company on the domestic market

the quebec government uses low electricity rates to attract new business and consolidate existing jobs despite its statutory obligation to sell electric power to every person who so requests the province has reserved the right to grant large load allocations to companies on a case by case basis since 1974 the threshold was set at 175 mw from 1987 to 2006 and was reduced to 50 mw in the government s 20062015 energy strategy large industrial users pay a lower rate than the domestic and commercial customers because of lower distribution costs in 2010 the largest industrial users the rate l customers were paying an average of 4.66 kwh whereas companies with special contracts paid 3.07 kwh in 1987 hydro-qubec and the quebec government agreed to a series of controversial deals with  giants  and  these risk sharing contracts set the price of electricity based on a series of factors including aluminum world prices and the value of the  those agreements are gradually being replaced by one based on published rates on may 10 2007 the quebec government signed an agreement with alcan the agreement which is still in force despite the company s merger with  renews the water rights concession on the saguenay and peribonka rivers in exchange alcan has agreed to invest in its quebec facilities and to maintain jobs and its corporate headquarters in montreal on december 19 2008 hydro-qubec and alcoa signed a similar agreement this agreement which expires in 2040 maintains the provision of electricity to alcoa s three  in the province located in   and  in addition the deal will allow alcoa to modernize the baie-comeau plant which will increase its production capacity by 110,000 tonnes a year to a total of 548,000 tonnes several economists including  s jean-thomas bernard and grard blanger have challenged the government s strategy and argue that sales to large industrial customers are very costly to the quebec economy in an article published in 2008 the researchers estimate that under the current regime a job in a new aluminum smelter or an expansion project costs the province between c 255,357 and c 729,653 a year when taking into consideration the money that could be made by selling the excess electricity on the new york market this argument is disputed by large industrial customers who point out that data from 2000 to 2006 indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase and vice versa  we find that the more we export the less lucrative it gets  said luc boulanger the head of the association representing quebec s large industrial customers in his opinion the high volatility of electricity markets and the transmission infrastructure physical limitations reduce the quantities of electricity that can be exported when prices are higher export markets

hydro-qubec sells part of its surplus electricity to neighbouring systems in canada and the united states under long term contracts and transactions on the new england new york and ontario  two subsidiaries hq energy marketing and hq energy services  u.s  are engaged in the electricity trade on behalf of the company in 2010 export sales of electricity brought in  1,513 million for a transaction volume of 23.3 twh despite  exceptionally low runoff  according to the company net exports accounted for a net income of  1,034 million and a net reservoir drawdown of 12.5 twh although most export sales are now short-term transactions hydro-qubec has entered into long-term export contracts in the past in 1990 the company signed a 328-mw deal with a group of 13 electric distributors in  exports from hydro-qubec account for 28 of all power used in the state on march 11 2010 vermont s two largest utilities green mountain power and central vermont public service entered into a tentative 26-year deal with hydro-qubec to purchase up to 225 mw of hydro power from 2012 to 2038 the memorandum of understanding provides for a price smoothing mechanism shielding vermont customers from market price spikes the deal is contingent upon the enactment designating large hydro as  renewable energy  the renewable energy law h.781 was adopted by both houses of the legislature and signed into law by governor  on june 4 2010 a second contract has been signed with cornwall electric a subsidiary of  a utility serving 23,000 customers in the   area the contract was renewed in 2008 and will be in force until 2019 the company has several advantages in its dealings in export markets first its costs are not affected by the fluctuations of  prices since  requires no fuel also hydro-qubec has a lot of flexibility in matching supply and demand so it can sell electricity at higher prices during the day and replenish its reservoirs at night when wholesale prices are lower third the quebec power grid peaks in winter because of heating unlike most neighboring systems where peak demand occur on very warm days in the summer due to the  needs of homes and offices the election of a supporter of    and the development of as  in  was seen as a positive development for the company s outlook despite the success of the previous policy of short-term sales on neighboring energy markets the quebec government asked hydro-qubec management to write a new strategic plan focusing on long-term sale agreements with us distributors as was the case after the commissioning of the james bay project the new plan was released in july 2009 hydro-qubec crews were also loaned to the  following  in october november 2012
