hurricane hilda was the most intense  of the  and ravaged areas of the  particularly  in addition to causing impacts inland the hurricane greatly disrupted offshore oil production and at its time was the costliest tropical cyclone for louisiana s offshore oil production due in part to flights made by the  hilda became one of the most well-documented storms meteorologically in the atlantic lasting for seven days as a tropical cyclone hilda caused us 126million in damage and 38deaths hilda developed over the southern shores of  on september28 as a  tracking westward in an area of favorable conditions and reaching  intensity the next day once situated in the  hilda strengthened into a hurricane and began a slow trawl northward  to its peak intensity with  of 150mph  240km h  on october1 making it a  equivalent slight weakening occurred as hilda made  on the southern louisiana coast on october3 after reaching land the hurricane took a sharp turn eastward and rapidly weakened as a result of land interaction and the presence of cool dry air the weakened remnants of hilda merged with a  a day after landfall and dissipated on october5 originating near cuba the cyclone intensified while moving through the gulf of mexico and became a category4 hurricane in the  before striking  in early october in combination with a  located across the southeast  the hurricane spread heavy rains through the south through the carolinas into the  hilda led to significant damage to oil platforms in the gulf of mexico as well as  126million  1964usd  in damage and 38 deaths

meteorological history 




storm path


the origins of hilda can be definitively traced back to a  that trekked across the western  during the last week of september however a loosely defined mass of clouds east of the  on september23 was potentially associated with the formation of hilda tracking westward the area of  gradually intensified with hints at a well-defined circulation as the system tracked over  on september27 by 1200utc on september28 the disturbance had become sufficiently defined to be classified as a  south of  tracking generally westward the depression crossed  on september29 intensifying to  strength in the meanwhile before moving into the northern  favorable conditions for  in the western caribbean including the presence of abnormally high  allowed for the further strengthening of hilda hilda s crossing of western cuba slightly disrupted the intensification of the tropical cyclone but strengthening resumed shortly thereafter upon reaching the  later of september29 hilda began to track very slowly at an average speed of 9mph  14km h  later meeting the threshold of hurricane intensity at 1200utc on september30 during that time atmospheric conditions over the gulf of mexico rapidly improved  a preexisting belt of strong  which would have inhibited further cyclonic strengthening disintegrated coincident with hilda s passage of the gulf  ensued on october1 and by 0600utc that day hilda became a major hurricane twelve hours later the hurricane reached its peak intensity with  of 150mph  240km h  and a minimum  of 941   27.79  based on  during this phase the storm was centered roughly 350mi  560km  south of  around the same time an abnormally strong  centered over  began to sharply curve the forward motion of hilda towards the north

following peak intensity further strengthening was inhibited due to the emergence of a  over the  the presence of this system injected dry air into hilda gradually weakening the hurricane the once prominent  of the storm clouded over as a result of this advection during the evening hours of october3 hilda made  on the central  coast with a minimum pressure of 950mbar  hpa  28.06inhg  and maximum sustained winds of 115mph  185km h  making it equivalent to a category3 hurricane on the modern-day  rapid weakening followed landfall as a result of the surrounding cold air  by 0600utc on october4 hilda had been downgraded to tropical storm intensity the same area of high pressure which had weakened the tropical cyclone later forced hilda eastward resulting in the storm s merging with a  and thus transitioning into an  later that day these extratropical remnants continued to track eastward before they were last noted near  on october5 preparations 
the first  issued by the weather bureau in association with hilda were issued on october1 when the agency issued a  for the coast of louisiana to  this prompted the  to issue a standby alert for the texas coast on october3 the weather bureau upgraded the watch to a  and expanded it to include the entire  eastward to mobile alabama as hilda neared the coast the scope of the warning was narrowed to include only areas of the louisiana gulf coast eastward to  and a gale warning for an extent of the united states gulf coast from  to  by the afternoon of october4 hurricane warnings were lowered but gale warnings remained in place evacuation of offshore  began as early as september29 the majority of the 2,000oil workers were evacuated on september30 and october1 along the united states gulf coast approximately 150,000people evacuated the u.s  and three companies of the  were assigned to areas of the coast expedite the evacuation process areas lining  were almost entirely evacuated re-purposed  were used to move 3,400evacuees northward from new orleans and  a mandatory evacuation order was placed for a 23mi  37km  section of the coast of  with shuttle buses assisting in evacuating refugees to  the  transported 10,000cots to evacuation centers in opelousas to serve the evacuees  and  were sites of mass exodus with hilda approaching the coast evacuation out of cameron was disrupted by the lack of a bridge across the  and thus had to be conducted via ferry heads of cattle were among those evacuating from  in fears of a repeat of  which had killed 35,000cattle similarly all residents of  were evacuated in  approximately 80%of the population evacuated though not directly at threat from hilda residents of  were evacuated to nearby towns in fears that roads linking the city to the mainland may be cut off by the hurricane s  a permanent off-shore drilling platform 30mi  48km  offshore of  was brought back to shore schools along the coast of louisiana including  and  were suspended in anticipation of the hurricane in  a federal disaster office was opened to coordinate preparation and relief efforts for  the  delayed a detonation of a  in the  near  the  scrammed planes from its air stations in  and new orleans louisiana in anticipation of hilda impact
the  cornelia b iii carrying a truck on deck encountered hilda s rough surf and winds as it traversed the gulf of mexico resulting in the truck being washed overboard as hilda tracked northward through the gulf of mexico the storm threatened an estimated  350million worth of offshore oil drilling facilities hilda would become the most destructive tropical cyclone to louisiana s offshore oil industry at the time of its impact accruing losses over  100million strong winds and heavy surf destroyed 13oil platforms and damaged 5beyond repair all but one of the lost oil rigs were built to withstand a   with the other constructed to withstand a  100-year storm   resulting from the impacted rigs released 11,869 of  into the gulf despite widespread evacuation of offshore drilling platforms the 14crewmembers of the ocean driller managed to ride out the storm at times withstanding winds as high as 120mph  190km h  united states gulf coast
the majority of deaths associated with hilda in louisiana were a result of  spawned by the hurricane in its outer peripheral  and  which began tracking across the region on october3 eight tornadoes occurred in louisiana due to the hurricane of which two were  despite tracking for only 11.5mi  1.62.4km  near  a tornado killed 22people and injured 165others destroying 35homes in the process automobiles in the path of the twister were also damaged debris picked up by the tornado was found 16mi  26km  away in  no other tornado in the state resulted in deaths though multiple twisters in the  caused extensive damage to several automobiles and buildings and injured five the same tornadoes also knocked down power lines knocking out  in localized areas  was knocked off the air as a result of these outages data from the hardest hit areas along the central louisiana coast remains sparse due to the small population density of the area  unofficially peaked at 10ft  3.0m  at the  at the mouth of the  tides reached as high as 6ft  1.8m  above  the strongest wind report was from  where a station clocked sustained winds of 120mph  190km h  near the coast in  a 125ft  38m  high  succumbed to hilda s strong winds and collapsed onto an adjacent town hall where civil defense personnel were operating the incident resulted in the deaths of eight and six injuries although there were no stations to report the intensity of winds in erath winds 6mi  9.7km  away in  reached 110mph  175km h  hilda s sharp curve eastward after landfall and the advection of cold air from the north resulted in gusty winds over the  area causing waves to break and spill over the seawall protecting the city from  the resulting waterfront flooding damaged fishing camps and other shoreline property elsewhere in southeastern louisiana strong winds stripped pecans and other nuts off of trees despite hilda s intensity at landfall much of the damage attributed to the hurricane was a result of heavy rains associated with the storm and its interaction with a nearby frontal boundary rainfall caused by the storm peaked at 17.71in  450mm  northwest of  the strong winds and rain caused extensive crop damage  98%of louisiana s sugar crop sustained some measure of damage although most of the state s cotton crop was harvested prior to hilda s landfall the heavy rains flattened unpicked cotton in southern louisiana resulting in us 10million in damage overall the effects of hilda in louisiana destroyed or heavily damaged nearly 2,600residences and inflicted minor damage on an additional 19,000 the  estimated that about 5,000people were injured and that of those 357were hospitalized elsewhere 

effects in  were minimal with gusts peaking at 45mph  72km h  near  and areas of the state receiving trace amounts of precipitation at most damage was limited to the portions of the coast which was impacted by minor storm surge peaking at 3.9ft  1.2m  above  at  some piers and arterial beach roads adjacent to the coast were damaged portions of  on the  were inundated by floodwater minor property damage occurred and no persons were injured in texas tracking across the southern areas of  hilda and later its remnants brought torrential rainfall to central and southern portions of the state the  received 12.57in  319mm  of rain the highest precipitation total statewide the heavy rains resulted in record rainfall totals for the month of october in several locations and  however the majority of damage in the state was a result of strong northerly winds which caused power outages and was destructive to the state s pecan and corn crops which had been nearing harvest cotton crops that were harvested prior to the passage of hilda were largely damaged power outages knocked out 460telephone circuits and over 30,000individual telephones strong winds also uprooted and felled trees and their limbs in addition to as well as a 200ft  61m  tall  near  as a result of hilda 20people were injured and damage exceeded  50,000 three of those injuries were a result of a tornado which impacted areas of  destroying a home two barns and a  across mississippi over 14,000homes were damaged of which 3,000were either heavily damaged or completely destroyed interacting with a cold front as it traversed  the remnants of hilda caused gusts as strong as 80mph  130km h  in  and  downing telecommunication lines uprooting trees and shattering windows piers lining  were either destroyed or damaged five people were injured in those two counties strong winds in  and  damaged or destroyed several buildings injuring four in addition to straight-line winds three tornadoes occurred across six counties in alabama with one injuring three people after damaging five homes a hospital and a  although rainfall peaked well inland at 8.91in  226mm  damage as a result of rain was limited to the coast where the combination of high tides and rain resulted in minor coastal inundation as the remnants of hilda moved across the  on october45 rough surf was produced with high tides causing minor tidal inundation along the florida coast one person drowned in the high surf produced by the storm off of  on october4 squalls in western and northern florida produced heavy rain with a maximum occurring in  which received 12.42in  315mm  the precipitation produced localized flooding in the  area the squalls also produced strong winds at times gusting to 60mph  97km h  near  a station at  clocked a 59mph  95km h  gust these winds caused minor damage limited to uprooted trees and broken limbs united states east coast 
rainfall from the remnants of hilda extended as far northeast as  as a result of the remnants interacting with a frontal boundary that extended across the united states east coast extremely torrential rains fell over  peaking at 12.73in  323mm  south of  the largest precipitation totals occurred in the state s northeastern extremities where widespread totals of 8in  200mm  or higher were reported the rains resulted in flash flooding causing extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure across georgia the excess floodwater caused streams to overflow their banks at least 30bridges were washed away by these swollen streams and several county roads were washed out the most considerable damage was reported in northeastern georgia coincident with the high rainfall totals there damage in  alone exceeded us 100,000 in addition to infrastructure damage thousands of acres of farmland were inundated torrential rainfall continued northeastwards into the  with statewide rainfall peaking at 11.66in  296mm  and 12.02in  305mm  in  and  respectively the rains in north carolina exacerbated preexisting flood conditions which had previously caused widespread agricultural and infrastructural damage as well as soil erosion though not directly a result of hilda s remnants they were likely influenced by the storm s interaction with a frontal boundary already overflowing rivers and streams rose even further reaching near-record levels  experienced severe flooding and roughly 4,000people were forced to evacuate their homes due to dangerous floodwaters two cars in mountainous regions were swept into inundated areas during the floods resulting in one death several tornadoes in six counties were also reported injuring two extensive wind damage was reported in  heavy rains in south carolina from october46 resulted in localized flash flooding particularly near streams in mountainous regions runoff from precipitation caused the   and tributaries of the  to swell inundated and causing substantial damage to adjacent agricultural land and roads in addition to breaching several small dams the flooding triggered landslides killing one person counties in the coastal plains of south carolina also experienced farmland road and residential damage due to the heavy rains retirement
