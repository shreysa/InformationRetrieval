a non-tropical  developed about 240miles  390km  south-southwest of  on april 18 through the interaction of an upper-level  and a surface frontal  the surface trough which extended from the gale center to  brought a plume of moisture northward from the  into the circulation which caused heavy rainfall in  the non-tropical low tracked generally northward with a  to its east and west and on april 19 the system began producing sporadic convection near its center  early that day satellite imagery indicated the presence of a tight inner core of winds after turning to the northwest it looped southeastward and gradually became separated from the surface frontal system due to the deepening of the upper-level trough over the system convection became better organized over the center and it is estimated the system developed into subtropical storm ana early on april 20 while located about 250miles  400km  west of bermuda operationally the  was not classified by the  until 21hours later the subtropical storm tracked east-southeastward and continued to organize and by late on april 20 an upper-level warm core was present over the system based on its organization ana is estimated to have become a tropical storm by 0000 on april 21 upon becoming a tropical storm ana attained a peak intensity of 60mph  95km h  which was based on estimates from the  and data from  shortly thereafter it made its closest point of approach to bermuda when it passed about 130miles  210km  southwest of the island operationally the cyclone was first classified by the national hurricane center around this time when it was considered a subtropical cyclone strong upper-level  removed much of the convection though a small area of thunderstorms persisted near the center the storm became completely separated from the upper-level system and the cyclone re-organized developing an  late on april 21 embedded within the flow of a cyclone to its north ana continued eastward and early on april 22 the wind shear again removed the convection from the center convection waxed and waned throughout the day and by april 23 the circulation had deteriorated in organization after turning to the northeast the circulation center merged with an approaching  on april 24 and tropical storm ana completed the transition into an  the extratropical storm accelerated east-northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on april 27 southeast of the  impact records and naming 




subtropical storm ana in the western atlantic ocean on april 20


prior to the development of ana the government of  issued a gale warning for the island upon its classification by the national hurricane center a  was issued for bermuda meandering near the island for several days while developing the storm dropped 2.63inches  67mm  of precipitation in a six-day period at the  winds on the island did not reach tropical storm force swells from the storm impacted the coast of  the combination of the swells and an outgoing tide caused a boat to capsize in  on april 20  two of its occupants drowned and the other two were rescued as an extratropical storm the remnants of ana dropped 0.87inches  22mm  of precipitation in the city of  in the  moisture from the remnants of ana also produced beneficial rainfall in the  two ships recorded tropical storm force winds in association with ana  the atlantic forest recorded 51mph  82km h  and a pressure of 998 on april 22 and the rosa delmas reported winds of 47mph  76km h  on april 23 on april 20 ana became the second  on record in the  in the month of april after a  in 1992 after attaining tropical characteristics it became the first tropical storm on record in the month of april and was among the earliest forming tropical or subtropical cyclones in the atlantic basin see also
