this article is about the class of poisonous substances for other uses see  a toxin  from      is a  substance produced within living cells or organisms  synthetic  created by artificial processes are thus excluded the term was first used by organic chemist ludwig brieger  18491919  toxins can be   or  that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by  interacting with biological  such as  or  toxins vary greatly in their  ranging from usually minor  such as a    to almost immediately deadly  such as

terminology 
toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents by their method of productionthe word toxin does not specify method of delivery  compare with  and the broader meaning of all substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms  it simply means it is a biologically produced poison there was an ongoing terminological dispute between  and the  over whether to call a toxin a  or  in which the nato opted for biological agent and the warsaw pact like most other countries in the world for chemical agent 
according to an  review of the   toxins are poisonous products of organisms  unlike biological agents they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves  and  since the signing of the constitition there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or toxins  according to    the term  toxin  means the  material or product of     including but not limited to     or   or infectious substances or a  or synthesized molecule whatever their origin and method of production 
a rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable

on a broader scale toxins may be classified as either  being excreted by an organism or  that are released mainly when bacteria are  biotoxins 
the term  biotoxin  is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin biotoxins are further classified into fungal biotoxins or short  microbial biotoxins plant biotoxins short  and animal biotoxins toxins produced by  are important  determinants responsible for microbial  and or evasion of the host  biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism and can be highly complex  the  of the  contains dozens of small  each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor  or relatively small protein biotoxins in nature have two primary functions

environmental toxins 
the term  environmental toxin  can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants such as industrial  and other artificially made  substances as this contradicts most formal definitions of the term  toxin  it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts environmental toxins from  that may be dangerous to human health include

finding information about toxins 
the toxicology and environmental health information program  tehip  at the   nlm  maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by tehip and by other government agencies and organizations this web site includes links to databases bibliographies tutorials and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources tehip also is responsible for the toxicology data network  toxnet  an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web  is a geographic information system  gis  that is part of toxnet toxmap uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the  s  epa   and  computational resources for prediction of toxic peptides and proteins 
one of the bottlenecks in peptide protein-based therapy is their toxicity recently in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins developed by  s group predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy the prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides the prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web server misuse of the term 
when used non-technically the term  toxin  is often applied to any  substance even though the term  would be more appropriate toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed  and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to  substances in general 
in the context of  and  the term  toxin  is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health this could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous  to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation   to food ingredients such as    msg  and  see also 












 feature or group within a  that is thought to be responsible for its toxic properties
