explanation 
a liquid crossing its standard freezing point will  in the presence of a  around which a  structure can form creating a solid lacking any such  the liquid  can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which  occurs homogeneous nucleation can occur above the  but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature an   non-crystalline  solid will form  normally freezes at 273.15  0c or 32f  but it can be  supercooled  at  down to its  at almost 224.8k  48.3c 55f  the process of supercooling requires that water be pure and free of  sites which can be achieved by processes like  or  but the cooling itself does not require any specialised technique if water is cooled at a rate on the order of 106k s the crystal nucleation can be avoided and water becomes a   that is an amorphous  non-crystalline  solid its  is much colder and harder to determine but studies estimate it at about 136k  137c 215f   can be heated up to approximately 150k  123c 189.4f  without nucleation occurring in the range of temperatures between 231k  42c 43.6f  and 150k  123c 189.4f  experiments find only crystal ice droplets of supercooled water often exist in  and   an  flying through such a cloud sees an abrupt crystallization of these droplets which can result in the formation of ice on the aircraft s wings or blockage of its instruments and probes unless the aircraft is equipped with an appropriate  system  is also caused by supercooled droplets the process opposite to supercooling the melting of a solid above the freezing point is much more difficult and a solid will almost always melt at the same  for a given  for this reason it is the melting point which is usually identified using   even when the subject of a paper is  freezing-point determination  the actual methodology is  the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice  it is possible at a given pressure to  a liquid above its  without it becoming gaseous supercooling is often confused with  supercooling is the cooling of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming solid freezing point depression is when a  can be cooled below the freezing point of the corresponding pure liquid due to the presence of the   an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when  is added to pure water constitutional supercooling 




constitutional supercooling  phase diagram concentration and temperature


constitutional supercooling which occurs during solidification is due to compositional solid changes and results in cooling a liquid below the freezing point ahead of the  when solidifying a liquid the interface is often unstable and the velocity of the solidliquid interface must be small in order to avoid constitutional supercooling supercooled zones are observed when the  temperature gradient at the interface is larger than the temperature gradient 


or



the slope of the liquidus phase boundary on the phase diagram is 
the concentration gradient is related to points  and  on the phase diagram 



for steady-state growth  and the partition function  can be assumed to be constant therefore the minimum thermal gradient necessary to create a stable solid front is as expressed below

the following paragraphs are about freezing-point depression they are not about supercooling the authors are confusing supercooling with freezing-point depression the paragraphs above warn about this confusion in order to survive extreme low temperatures in certain environments some animals use the phenomenon of freezing-point depression that allow them to remain unfrozen and avoid cell damage and death there are many techniques that aid in lowering the freezing point such as the production of  or afps which bind to ice crystals to prevent water molecules from binding and spreading the growth of ice the  is one such fish that utilizes these proteins to survive in its frigid environment noncolligative proteins are secreted by the liver into the bloodstream other animals use colligative antifreezes which increases the concentration of solutes in their bodily fluids thus lowering their freezing point fish that rely on supercooling for survival must also live well below the water surface because if they came into contact with ice nuclei they would freeze immediately animals that undergo supercooling to survive must also remove ice-nucleating agents from their bodies because they act as a starting point for freezing supercooling is also common in insects reptiles and other  with insects being able to survive in the coldest environments out of any supercooling animals it should be noted that supercooling is a last resort for animals the best option is to move to a warmer environment if possible as an animal gets farther and farther below its original freezing point the chance of spontaneous freezing increases dramatically for its internal fluids as this is a thermodynamically unstable state the fluids eventually reach the supercooling point which is the temperature at which the supercooled solution freezes spontaneously due to being so far below its normal freezing point animals unintentionally undergo supercooling and are only able to decrease the odds of freezing once supercooled even though supercooling is essential for survival there are many risks associated with it in plants 
as demonstrated by animals plants can also survive extreme cold conditions brought forth during the winter months many plant species located in northern climates can acclimate under these cold conditions by supercooling thus these plants survive temperatures up to40c although this supercooling phenomenon is poorly understood it has been recognized through  ice nucleation occurs in certain plant organs and tissues debatably beginning in the  tissue and spreading throughout the rest of the plant infrared thermography allows for droplets of water to be visualized as they crystalize in extracellular spaces supercooling inhibits the formation of ice within the tissue by ice nucleation and allows the cells to maintain water in a liquid state and further allows the water within the cell to stay separate from extracellular ice cellular barriers such as   and the cuticle inhibit ice nucleators and force water into the supercooled tissue the xylem and primary tissue of plants are very susceptible to cold temperatures because of the large proportion of water in the cell many boreal hardwood species in northern climates have the ability to prevent ice spreading into the shoots allowing the plant to tolerate the cold supercooling has been identified in the evergreen shrubs  and  as well as   and  species freezing outside of the cell and within the cell wall does not affect the survival of the plant however the extracellular ice may lead to plant dehydration applications 
one commercial application of supercooling is in  freezers can cool drinks to a supercooled level so that when they are opened they form a  another example is a product that can supercool the beverage in a conventional freezer  briefly marketed special  containing  in the uk and coke in singapore which stored the bottles in a supercooled state so that their content would turn to  upon opening supercooling was successfully applied to organ preservation at massachusetts general hospital   that were later transplanted into recipient animals were preserved by supercooling for up to 96 hours  4 days  quadrupling the limits of what could be achieved by conventional liver preservation methods the livers were supercooled to a temperature of 6c in a specialized solution that protected against freezing and injury from the cold temperature another potential application is drug delivery in 2015 researchers demonstrated the ability to crystallize membranes at a specific time liquid-encapsulated drugs can potentially be delivered to the site and with a slight environmental change the liquid rapidly changes into a crystalline form that releases the drug in 2016 a team at  proposed a method for  soldering without heat  by using encapsulated droplets of supercooled liquid metal to repair heat sensitive electronic devices see also
