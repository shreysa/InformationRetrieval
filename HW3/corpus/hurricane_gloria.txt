early in gloria s duration it threatened the northern lesser antilles prompting a  and later warning for the area gloria also threatened the bahamas prompting that government to issue hurricane watches and warnings while gloria was off the east coast of florida the nhc issued a hurricane watch from  to  virginia which was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1000utc on september26 or 19.5hours before landfall by later that day a hurricane watch was issued for the rest of the eastern united states to  by two hours before gloria s landfall on long island a hurricane warning was in effect for the same area after warnings were gradually extended further north officials anticipated higher winds and  than what occurred due to the hurricane weakening as it approached landfall officials in delaware and maryland declared a state of emergency before the storm struck and thousands of people from coastal communities evacuated to shelters schools closed in delaware and non-emergency workers were sent home along long island in new york hundreds of thousands of people evacuated their homes and a state of emergency was declared for several counties in connecticut about 20,000people evacuated along the coast and 7,300evacuated from neighboring rhode island residents also evacuated portions of  as gloria approached the  national hurricane center director  called it the  storm of the century  due to its intensity and potential track over the densely populated region of  such a track gathered the attention of many people and led to the evacuation of 380,000people along the coast from north carolina to connecticut in  officials implemented  to expedite the evacuation process a policy many other coastal states use officials advised 95,000 citizens along the  coastline an area that rarely experiences hurricanes to evacuate the most vulnerable part of the state and among the most susceptible in the entire countrywould require 36hours in 2005 to evacuate the 100,000citizens and 900,000tourists that were commonly present during busy summer weekends offices and classes of  closed only for the third time in the 20th century the previous cases being the  and the  although gloria s winds downed numerous trees and caused tens of thousands in damage in the area overall effects were much less than expected at the same time gloria was making landfall on long island a storm warning was issued for western new brunswick and nova scotia across atlantic canada the threat of hurricane gloria caused many citizens to rely on american media for storm coverage impact

hurricane gloria was a large hurricane that affected much of the  gloria brought strong wind gusts which downed trees and left hundreds of thousands without power overall damage was estimated at  900million and there were fourteen deaths gloria was the first significant hurricane to affect new england since  in 1960 carolinas and mid-atlantic 
while offshore the eastern united states the hurricane s strongest winds were on the eastern periphery which reduced the winds over land in north carolina where gloria made its first landfall the strongest winds were 74mph  119km h  at a station near  at the   office  a gust of 87mph  140km h  was also observed there at  located offshore sustained winds reached 98mph  158km h  with gusts to 120mph  190km h  a peak storm surge of 5.9ft  1.8m  was estimated at the  a minimal surge of around 1.3ft  0.4ft  occurred in neighboring south carolina where winds were below tropical storm force the highest rainfall related to gloria was 9.7in  250mm  recorded in  high waves and storm surge resulted in heavy coastal flooding and beach erosion along the outer banks and several new inlets were created coastal flooding damaged several homes in the outer banks damage in the state was estimated at  8.1million including  2.4million in crop damage there was one death in north carolina when a man was struck by a fallen tree throughout much of the mid-atlantic the winds remained generally below hurricane force  however winds reached 92mph  147km h  along the  in virginia and gusts to 89mph  144km h  in  the strongest winds in the region occurred after the center passed the area due to gloria s fast motion there was minimal coastal flooding because the highest storm surge occurred during low tide generally less than 4.9ft  1.5m  beach erosion was reported in both maryland and delaware the heaviest rainfall was west of the center statewide peaks included 9.17in  233mm  at  in pennsylvania 8.6in  220mm  in  and 7.19in  183mm  in  rainfall spread as far inland as west virginia high waves washed away 30ft  9.1m  of a fishing pier in  the rainfall caused minor flooding and high tides flooded coastal portions of the  region there was minor damage to trees roofs and signs in southeastern virginia the center of gloria passed about 30mi  48km  offshore eastern maryland in ocean city waves of 15ft  4.6m  severely damaged the boardwalk washing sand and debris a block inland downed trees left about 150,000people in maryland high winds forced the  to close and there was little damage outside of eastern maryland high waves in delaware eroded beaches wrecked dunes and damaged oceanfront buildings and boardwalks storm flooding closed several highways including  damage was heaviest in  although the storm damaged corn and soybean crops in northern delaware monetary damage totaled over  500,000 in the state in neighboring pennsylvania wind gusts reached 56mph  90km h  in  which knocked down many trees and left thousands without power heavy rainfall flooded many streams which closed or damaged several highways bridges and rail lines about 3,000houses were flooded forcing thousands to evacuate while just off the new jersey coast gloria produced strong winds peaking at 81mph  130km h  in  where a gust of 101mph  162km h  was also reported in the town an  tornado was reported damaging a house rainfall in the state reached 6.00in  152mm  at the charlotteburg reservoir near  heavy beach erosion occurred along the coast and several coastal towns sustained damage to boardwalks strong winds downed trees and power lines which damaged homes and cars one person was killed in  after touching a downed power line though gloria moved quickly through the region it dropped moderate rainfall in locations including 6.04inches  153mm  at  in addition some unofficial reports in southeastern  indicated amounts of up to 8inches  200mm  of rain because much of the mid-atlantic experienced the western weaker side of this hurricane damage was relatively light high winds downed numerous trees throughout the area leaving hundreds of thousands without power including 237,000 in new jersey 124,000 in maryland and 56,000 in virginia extreme rainfall in  resulted in  5.5million  1985usd  in damage intense flood waters split  in half for a period of time long island and new york

while moving across new england gloria was a weakened hurricane that passed quickly through the area though still a large hurricane gloria hit at low tide resulting in low to moderate storm surges of 5feet  1.5m  in  6feet  1.8m  in  and 3feet  1m  in  the high waves caused heavy beach erosion in connecticut and rhode island the highest sustained winds were reports of 83mph  135km h  in  and  in massachusetts although neither location is at sea level gusts peaked at 110mph  176km h  in  and widespread areas across new england reported hurricane-force gusts it is estimated that hurricane-force winds occurred in connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire rainfall in the region peaked at 6.90in  175mm  at borden brook reservoir in  in connecticut gloria crossed from westport along the long island sound passed near  and exited into massachusetts wind gusts peaked at 92mph  148km h  in  and also reached 82mph  132km h  in hartford the winds downed thousands of trees many of which knocked down power lines this left about 727,000residents without power setting a record for the state related to a weather event high waves damaged or sunk hundreds of boats along the coast and several beachfront homes and docks were damaged light rainfall caused some minor flooding mostly in northwestern connecticut statewide there was about  6million in crop damage damage was heaviest near hartford and overall storm damage was estimated at  91million fallen trees contributed to two of the three deaths in the state as well as several other injuries hurricane-force gusts affected rhode island peaking at 92mph  148km h  in  the winds uprooted thousands of trees and caused widespread roof damage about 300,000people statewide lost power the greatest since the  coastal flooding was minimized due to the storm striking at low tide although were high enough in  to damage docks and hundreds of boats damage in the state was estimated at  20million including the cost for restoring the power outages there were two deaths in rhode island  one was related to a fallen tree and one occurred when a man was trying to secure his boat in massachusetts the hurricane moved from connecticut through the  area there was a small f1 tornado in  that damaged trees high winds knocked over thousands of trees and about 500,000people statewide lost power heavy rainfall caused stream flooding although the heaviest damage was from the winds the hurricane destroyed a radio tower in  and damaged hundreds of homes in the eastern portion of the state along the coast the storm tide caused minor coastal flooding and damaged hundreds of boats across massachusetts damage was estimated at  61million including  6million from crop damage by the time gloria reached new hampshire it had weakened and was becoming extratropical although hurricane-force wind gusts were reported across the state on the top of mount washington wind gusts reached 127mph  204km h  the winds were strong enough to knock down large trees many over 50years old and 50ft  15m  downed trees cut power lines which left 97,116people without power mostly along the coast fallen trees also damaged 16homes and several vehicles high rainfall damaged portions of  although water damage was generally minor there was one death in the state when an elderly woman was knocked over by the strong winds and died two weeks later there was about  2.5million in crop damage mostly to the apple crop in neighboring maine about 600,000people lost power due to the storm the most since the passage of hurricanes  and  in 1954 winds in maine reached 86mph  138km h  and the storm knocked down about 100power poles in addition to the downed lines downed trees blocked roads and damaged houses and cars the winds damaged roofs including the 127yearold spire of a church in  crop damage to the apple crop was estimated at  3million high waves along the coast damaged lobster traps and dozens of boats many of which were driven ashore gloria s high winds downed numerous trees across new england causing minor to moderate damage in the region connecticut received the worst of the hurricane where tree and structural damage was greatest along the coastline storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers and some roadways were underwater during the storm s passage  was affected only slightly from the hurricane and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding in  damage was more severe where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees high winds across new england resulted in significant power outages leaving 250,000 in maine in all seven deaths occurred in new england many of which occurred from falling tree limbs while the remnants of gloria were moving through atlantic canada they produced rainfall to the north of the track reaching as high as 4.53in  115mm  in quebec the highest winds in the country were 58mph  93km h  peaking in the  and to the northeast of  the remnants of gloria caused wind and wave damage in nova scotia wind gusts of 55mph  89km h  in  new brunswick knocked down power lines affecting more than 1,800people aftermath

on long island thousands were left without power for over a week until the last outages were restored two weeks after the storm on october8 the long duration without electricity forced hundreds of schools to close extended train times by six hours due to lack of powered crossings and  on food ice and generators the lack of power led to a general disdain for the   lilco  which increased further when the company left the  40million  1985usd  repair bill to the ratepayers citing the company s lack of hurricane insurance citizens quickly protested lilco s decision and within years the publicly owned  was formed residents in both massachusetts and connecticut were also without power for up to one week which caused many food products to spoil due to lack of refrigeration the states brought in workers from other states although the delay in restoring the widespread outages caused many schools to remain closed in connecticut one man was electrocuted while repairing downed power lines about 477,000  customers in the state lost power a record that was surpassed by the 754,000 who lost power during  in 2011 later in 2011 a  left over 830,000people statewide without power also breaking the record set by gloria in new hampshire most power outages were quickly restored and all were restored within six days in maine all power outages were restored in 11days in maine most citizens remained indoors during the passage of the hurricane one police officer noted that even the criminals stayed home in the  area restaurants experienced a great surge in business during the power outage after the storm several businesses stored frozen goods for houses without a generator after the storm president  declared several counties in new jersey pennsylvania new york rhode island connecticut and massachusetts as federal disaster areas this declaration allowed those counties to apply for disaster assistance in canada the damage was less than expected but confusion related to the storm threat prompted  to research the need for a dedicated hurricane centre in 1986 the following year the  was established with offices on both the atlantic and pacific coasts due to its impact the name gloria was retired from the atlantic tropical storm naming list it will never again be used for an  it was replaced with grace in the  see also
