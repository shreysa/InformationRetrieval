etymology and history of cloud science and nomenclature 
main article  
etymology 
the origin of the term cloud can be found in the  clud or clod meaning a hill or a mass of rock around the beginning of the 13th century it was extended as a  to include rain clouds as masses of evaporated water in the sky because of the similarity in appearance between a mass of rock and a cumulus heap cloud over time the metaphoric term replaced the original old english weolcan to refer to clouds in general aristotle and theophrastus 
ancient cloud studies were not made in isolation but were observed in combination with other  elements and even other natural sciences in about 340 bc the greek philosopher  wrote  a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science including weather and climate for the first time precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation fell were called meteors which originate from the greek word meteoros meaning  high in the sky  from that word came the modern term  the study of clouds and weather meteorologica was based on intuition and simple observation but not on what is now considered the scientific method nevertheless it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics first comprehensive classification 
after centuries of speculative theories about the formation and behavior of clouds the first truly scientific studies were undertaken by  in england and  in france howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the latin language and used his background to classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802 he believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and had come up with a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of  because it used unusual french names for cloud types his system of nomenclature included twelve categories of clouds with such names as  translated from french  hazy clouds dappled clouds and broom-like clouds by contrast howard used universally accepted latin which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803 as a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme the german dramatist and poet  composed four poems about clouds dedicating them to howard an elaboration of howard s system was eventually formally adopted by the international meteorological conference in 1891 this system covered only the tropospheric cloud types but the discovery of clouds above the troposphere during the late 19th century eventually led to the creation separate classification schemes for these very high clouds tropospheric 
for a comprehensive listing of over 90 combinations of genera divided into species and subdivided into varieties with latin etymologies see  tropospheric classification is based on a hierarchy of categories with physical forms and altitude levels at the top these are cross-classified into a total of ten genus types most of which can be divided into species and further subdivided into varieties which are at the bottom of the hierarchy physical forms 
clouds in the troposphere assume five physical forms based on structure and process of formation these forms are commonly used for the purpose of satellite analysis they are given below in approximate ascending order of instability or  activity two of the forms are each divided into several genera that are differentiated mainly by altitude range or level the other three comprise just one genus type for each form stratiform 
non-convective stratiform clouds appear in stable airmass conditions and in general have flat sheet-like structures that can form at any altitude in the troposphere very low stratiform cloud results when  is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions the stratiform group is divided by altitude range into the genera   high-level    mid-level    low-level  and   multi-level  cirriform 
cirriform clouds are generally of the genus  and have the appearance of detached or semi-merged filaments they form at high tropospheric altitudes in air that is mostly stable with little or no convective activity although denser patches may occasionally show buildups caused by limited high-level  where the air is partly unstable stratocumuliform 
clouds of this structure have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics in the form of rolls ripples or patches they generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer if the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop tops in the form of turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups the stratocumuliform group is divided into   high-level    mid-level  and   low-level  cumuliform 
cumuliform clouds generally appear in isolated heaps or tufts they are the product of localized but generally free-convective lift where there are no inversion layers in the atmosphere to limit vertical growth in general small cumuliform clouds tend to indicate comparatively weak instability larger cumuliform types are a sign of moderate to strong atmospheric instability and convective activity depending on their vertical size clouds of the  genus type may be low-level or multi-level with moderate to towering vertical extent cumulonimbiform

the largest free-convective clouds comprise the genus  which are multi-level because of their towering vertical extent they occur in highly unstable air and often have complex structures that include cirriform tops and multiple accessory clouds levels and genera

tropospheric clouds form in any of three levels  formerly called   based on altitude range above the earth s surface the grouping of clouds into levels is commonly done for the purposes of   and  the base-height range for each level varies depending on the latitudinal  each altitude level comprises two or three genus types differentiated mainly by physical form the standard levels and genus-types are summarised below in approximate descending order of the altitude at which each is normally based multi-level clouds with significant vertical extent are separately listed and summarized in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity high-level 




high  and   see also  species and varieties  section  upper-left merging into  with some higher  upper right


high clouds form at altitudes of 3,000 to 7,600m  10,000 to 25,000ft  in the  5,000 to 12,200m  16,500 to 40,000ft  in the  and 6,100 to 18,300m  20,000 to 60,000ft  in the  all cirriform clouds are classified as high and thus constitute a single genus cirrus  ci  stratocumuliform and stratiform clouds in the high altitude range carry the prefix cirro yielding the respective genus names cirrocumulus  cc  and cirrostratus  cs  when limited-resolution satellite images of high clouds are analysed without supporting data from direct human observations it becomes impossible to distinguish between individual forms or genus types which are then collectively identified as high-type  or informally as cirrus-type even though not all high clouds are of the cirrus form or genus  
genus cirrus  ci 


these are mostly fibrous wisps of delicate white cirriform ice crystal cloud that show up clearly against the blue sky cirrus are generally non-convective except castellanus and floccus subtypes which show limited convection they often form along a high altitude  and at the very leading edge of a frontal or low-pressure disturbance where they may merge into cirrostratus these high clouds do not produce precipitation 

genus cirrocumulus  cc 





a large field of cirrocumulus stratiformis



this is a pure white high stratocumuliform layer of limited convection it is composed of ice crystals or supercooled water droplets appearing as small unshaded round masses or flakes in groups or lines with ripples like sand on a beach cirrocumulus occasionally forms alongside cirrus and may be accompanied or replaced by cirrostratus clouds at the very leading edge of an active weather system 

genus cirrostratus  cs 


cirrostratus is a thin non-convective stratiform ice crystal veil that typically gives rise to halos caused by refraction of the sun s rays the sun and moon are visible in clear outline.cirrostratus often thickens into altostratus ahead of a warm front or low-pressure area 
mid-level

non-vertical clouds in the middle level are prefixed by alto yielding the genus names altocumulus  ac  and altostratus  as  these clouds can form as low as 2,000m  6,500ft  above surface at any latitude but may be based as high as 4,000m  13,000ft  near the poles 7,000m  23,000ft  at mid latitudes and 7,600m  25,000ft  in the tropics as with high clouds it is not possible to distinguish between individual forms or genera using satellite photography alone without the support of human observations these clouds are usually collectively identified as middle-type on satellite images 
genus altocumulus  ac 


this is a mid-level stratocumuliform cloud layer of limited convection that is usually appears in the form of irregular patches or more extensive sheets arranges in groups lines or waves altocumulus near the top of its range may resemble cirrocumulus but is usually thicker and composed of water droplets so that the bases show at least some light-grey shading opaque altocumulus associated with a weak frontal or low-pressure disturbance can produce virga very light intermittent precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground if the altocumulus is mixed with moisture-laden altostratus the precipitation may reach the ground 

genus altostratus  as 





altostratus translucidus near top of photo merging into altostratus opacus near bottom



altostratus is a mid-level opaque or translucent non-convective veil of grey blue-grey cloud that often forms along warm fronts and around low-pressure areas altostratus is usually composed of water droplets but may be mixed with ice crystals at higher altitudes widespread opaque altostratus can produce light continuous or intermittent precipitation precipitation commonly becomes heavier and more widespread if it thickens into nimbostratus 
low-level 
low clouds are found from near surface up to 2,000m  6,500ft  genus types in this level either have no prefix or carry one that refers to a characteristic other than altitude clouds that form in the low level of the troposphere are generally of larger structure than those that form in the middle and high levels so they can usually be identified by their forms and genus types using satellite photography alone

genus stratocumulus  sc 


this genus type is a stratocumuliform cloud layer of limited convection usually in the form of irregular patches or more extensive sheets similar to altocumulus but having larger elements with deeper-gray shading opaque stratocumulus can produce very light intermittent precipitation this cloud often forms under a precipitating deck of altostratus or high-based nimbostratus associated with a well-developed warm front slow-moving cold front or low-pressure area this can create the illusion of continuous precipitation of more than very light intensity falling from stratocumulus 

genus cumulus  cu  species humilis  little vertical extent 


these are small detached fair-weather cumuliform clouds that have nearly horizontal bases and flattened tops and do not produce rain showers 

genus stratus  st 





stratus nebulosus translucidus



this is a flat or sometimes ragged non-convective stratiform type that sometimes resembles elevated fog only very weak precipitation can fall from this cloud  usually drizzle or snow grains  although heavier rain or snow may fall through a stratus layer from a higher precipitating cloud deck when a low stratiform cloud contacts the ground it is called  if the prevailing surface visibility is less than 1 kilometer although radiation and advection types of fog tend to form in clear air rather than from stratus layers if the visibility increases to 1 kilometer or higher in any kind of fog the visible condensation is termed  
multi-level  low to mid-level cloud base 




moderate to deep vertical nimbostratus cloud covering the sky with a scattered layer of low stratus fractus pannus  see also  species  and  supplementary features  sections 


these clouds have low to middle level bases that form anywhere from near surface to about 2,400m  8,000ft  and tops that can extend into the high altitude range nimbostratus and some cumulus in this group usually achieve moderate or deep vertical extent but without towering structure however with sufficient airmass instability upward-growing cumuliform clouds can grow to high towering proportions although genus types with vertical extent are often informally considered a single group the  distinguishes towering vertical clouds more formally as a separate group or sub-group it is specified that these very large cumuliform and cumulonimbiform types must be identified by their standard names or abbreviations in all aviation observations  metars  and forecasts  tafs  to warn pilots of possible severe weather and turbulence multi-level clouds are of even larger structure than low clouds and are therefore identifiable by their forms and genera  and even species in the case of cumulus congestus  using satellite photography

genus nimbostratus  ns 


this is a diffuse dark-grey non-convective stratiform layer with great horizontal extent and moderate to deep vertical development it lacks towering structure and looks feebly illuminated from the inside nimbostratus normally forms from mid-level altostratus and develops at least moderate vertical extent when the base subsides into the low level during precipitation that can reach moderate to heavy intensity it commonly achieves deep vertical development when it simultaneously grows upward into the high level due to large scale frontal or cyclonic lift the nimbo prefix refers to its ability to produce continuous rain or snow over a wide area especially ahead of a warm front this thick cloud layer may be accompanied by embedded towering cumuliform or cumulonimbiform types meteorologists affiliated with the   wmo  officially classify nimbostratus as mid-level for synoptic purposes while informally characterizing it as multi-level independent meteorologists and educators appear split between those who largely follow the wmo model and those who classify nimbostratus as low-level despite its considerable vertical extent and its usual initial formation in the middle altitude range 

genus cumulus  cu  species mediocris  moderate vertical extent 


these cumuliform clouds of free convection have clear-cut medium-grey flat bases and white domed tops in the form of small sproutings and generally do not produce precipitation they usually form in the low level of the troposphere except during conditions of very low relative humidity when the clouds bases can rise into the middle altitude range moderate cumulus is officially classified as low-level and more informally characterized as having vertical extent that can involve more than one altitude level 

towering vertical

these clouds are sometimes classified separately from the other vertical or multi-level types because of their ability to produce severe turbulence 
genus cumulus  cu  species congestus  great vertical extent 


increasing airmass instability can cause free-convective cumulus to grow very tall to the extent that the vertical height from base to top is greater than the base-width of the cloud the cloud base takes on a darker grey coloration and the top commonly resembles a cauliflower this cloud type can produce moderate to heavy showers and is designated towering cumulus  tcu  by  

genus cumulonimbus  cb 

for information about the life-cycle or stages of a cumulonimbus see  



isolated cumulonimbus cloud over the  releasing a heavy shower



this genus type is a heavy towering cumulonimbiform mass of free convective cloud with a dark-grey to nearly black base and a very high top in the form of a mountain or huge tower cumulonimbus can produce  local very heavy downpours of  that may cause  and a variety of types of  including cloud-to-ground that can cause  other convective severe weather may or may not be associated with thunderstorms and include heavy  showers  strong   and  of all these possible cumulonimbus-related events lightning is the only one of these that requires a thunderstorm to be taking place since it is the lightning that creates the thunder cumulonimbus clouds can form in unstable airmass conditions but tend to be more concentrated and intense when they are associated with unstable  
species and varieties 




 forming over mountains in wyoming with lower layer of cumulus mediocris and higher layer of cirrus spissatus


genus types are commonly divided into subtypes called species that indicate specific structural details which can vary according to the stability and windshear characteristics of the atmosphere at any given time and location despite this hierarchy a particular species may be a subtype of more than one genus especially if the genera are of the same physical form and are differentiated from each other mainly by altitude or level there are a few species each of which can be associated with genera of more than one physical form the species types are grouped below according to the physical forms and genera with which each is normally associated the forms genera and species are listed in approximate ascending order of instability or convective activity genus and species types are further subdivided into varieties whose names can appear after the species name to provide a fuller description of a cloud some cloud varieties are not restricted to a specific altitude level or form and can therefore be common to more than one genus or species species 
stable or mostly stable of the stratiform group high-level cirrostratus comprises two species cirrostratus nebulosus has a rather diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail cirrostratus fibratus is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional to or from cirrus mid-level altostratus and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species low stratus is of the species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus   see below  cirriform clouds have three non-convective species that can form in mostly stable airmass conditions cirrus fibratus comprise filaments that may be straight wavy or occasionally twisted by non-convective wind shear the species uncinus is similar but has upturned hooks at the ends cirrus spissatus appear as opaque patches that can show light grey shading stratocumuliform genus-types  cirrocumulus altocumulus and stratocumulus  that appear in mostly stable air have two species each the stratiformis species normally occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective activity clouds of the lenticularis species tend to have lens-like shapes tapered at the ends they are most commonly seen as orographic mountain but can occur anywhere in the troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure these two species can be found in the high middle or low level of the troposphere depending on the stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given time ragged the species fractus shows variable instability because it can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics this subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets  stratus fractus  or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability  cumulus fractus  when they form at low altitudes stratiform and cumuliform genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes with or without brisk or gusty winds they are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name pannus  see section on supplementary features  partly unstable these species are subdivisions of genus types that occur in partly unstable air the species castellanus appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability usually in the morning or afternoon this results in the formation of cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base castellanus resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus tufted clouds of the more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure they are sometimes seen with cirrus and with tufted cirrocumulus altocumulus and stratocumulus low and mid level castellanus or floccus can resemble cumulo and cumulonimbogenitus formations  see  mother clouds  section  however the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building a newly recognized species of stratocumulus or altocumulus has been given the name volutus a roll cloud that can occur ahead of a cumulonimbus formation there are some volutus clouds that form as a consequence of interactions with specific geographical features rather than with a parent cloud perhaps the strangest geographically specific cloud of this type is the  a rolling cylindrical cloud that appears unpredictably over the  in  associated with a powerful  ripple  in the atmosphere the cloud may be  surfed  in  aircraft unstable or mostly unstable more general airmass instability in the troposphere tends to produce clouds of the more freely convective cumulus genus type whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant vertical development of the clouds a cumulus cloud initially forms in the low level of the troposphere as a cloudlet of the species humilis that shows only slight vertical development if the air becomes more unstable the cloud tends to grow vertically into the species mediocris then congestus the tallest cumulus species which is the same type that the international civil aviation organization refers to as  towering cumulus  with highly unstable atmospheric conditions large cumulus may continue to grow into cumulonimbus calvus  essentially a very tall congestus cloud that produces thunder  then ultimately into the species capillatus when supercooled water droplets at the top of the cloud turn into ice crystals giving it a cirriform appearance varieties 
opacity-based

all cloud varieties fall into one of two main groups one group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus  thin translucent  perlucidus  thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks  and opacus  thick opaque  these varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity all three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus however only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent or in the case of cirrus spissatus always opaque similarly these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque pattern-based

a second group describes the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer  cloud fields usually being visible only from a significant altitude above the formations  these varieties are not always present with the genera and species with which they are otherwise associated but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus they are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties the variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon it is sometimes seen with the fibratus and uncinus species of cirrus the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus and with the genus altostratus

another variety duplicatus  closely spaced layers of the same type one above the other  is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis the variety undulatus  having a wavy undulating base  can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis and with altostratus it is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus the variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes in the form of a honeycomb or net it is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis castellanus and floccus and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus combinations it is possible for some species to show combined varieties at one time especially if one variety is opacity-based and the other is pattern-based an example of this would be a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks the full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus which would identify respectively its genus species and two combined varieties accessory clouds supplementary features and other derivative types 
see also  
supplementary features and accessory clouds are not further subdivisions of cloud types below the species and variety level rather they are either hydrometeors or special cloud types with their own latin names that form in association with certain cloud genera species and varieties supplementary features whether in the form of clouds or precipitation are directly attached to the main genus-cloud accessory clouds by contrast are generally detached from the main cloud precipitation-based supplementary features 
one group of supplementary features are not actual cloud formations but precipitation that falls when water droplets or ice crystals that make up visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft virga is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground these being of the genera cirrocumulus altocumulus altostratus nimbostratus stratocumulus cumulus and cumulonimbus when the precipitation reaches the ground without completely evaporating it is designated as the feature praecipitatio this normally occurs with altostratus opacus which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development of the latter upward-growing cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier more extensive precipitation towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds cumulonimbus the largest of all cloud genera has the capacity to produce very heavy showers low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga cloud-based supplementary features 
incus is the most type-specific supplementary feature seen only with cumulonimbus of the species capillatus a  cloud top is one that has spread out into a clear anvil shape as a result of rising air currents hitting the stability layer at the  where the air no longer continues to get colder with increasing altitude the mamma feature forms on the bases of clouds as downward-facing bubble-like protuberances caused by localized downdrafts within the cloud it is also sometimes called mammatus an earlier version of the term used before a standardization of latin nomenclature brought about by the world meterorological organization during the 20th century the best-known is  but the mamma feature is also seen occasionally with cirrus cirrocumulus altocumulus altostratus and stratocumulus a tuba feature is a cloud column that may hang from the bottom of a cumulus or cumulonimbus a newly formed or poorly organized column might be comparatively benign but can quickly intensify into a funnel cloud or tornado an  feature is a roll cloud with ragged edges attached to the lower front part of cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that forms along the leading edge of a squall line or thunderstorm outflow a large arcus formation can have the appearance of a dark menacing arch several new supplementary features have been formally recognized by the   wmo  the feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear and instability when wave-like clouds of the variety undulatus break into regularly spaced crests this variant is sometimes known informally as a  this phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets and even in the sun s atmosphere another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with the undulatus variety has been given the latin name asperitus the supplementary feature cavum is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or cirrocumulus fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude this type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes a murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes a cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm accessory clouds 
supplementary cloud formations detached from the main cloud are known as  the heavier precipitating clouds nimbostratus towering cumulus  cumulus congestus  and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the pannus feature low ragged clouds of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus a group of accessory clouds comprise formations that are associated mainly with upward-growing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection pileus is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus cloud whereas a velum feature is a thin horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around the middle or in front of the parent cloud an accessory cloud recently officially recognized the world meteorological organization is the flumen also known more informally as the beaver s tail it is formed by the warm humid  of a super-cell thunderstorm and can be mistaken for a tornado although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk it is similar in appearance to pannus or  clouds and does not rotate mother clouds 




cumulus partly spreading into stratocumulus cumulogenitus over the port of  in greece


clouds initially form in clear air or become clouds when fog rises above surface level the genus of a newly formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content if these characteristics change over time the genus tends to change accordingly when this happens the original genus is called a mother cloud if the mother cloud retains much of its original form after the appearance of the new genus it is termed a genitus cloud one example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift if the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus it is considered to be a mutatus cloud

other genitus and mutatus clouds 
the genitus and mutatus categories have been expanded to include certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds the term flammagenitus  latin for  fire-made  applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions smaller low-level  pyrocumulus  or  fumulus  clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus  latin for  man-made   formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling any of the high cloud genus-types and are now officially designated as cirrus cirrostratus or cirrocumulus homogenitus if a homogenitus cloud of one genus changes to another genus type it is then termed a homomutatus cloud stratus cataractagenitus  latin for  cataract-made  are generated by the spray from waterfalls silvagenitus  latin for  forest-made  is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor is added to the air above a forest canopy stratocumulus fields 
stratocumulus clouds can be organized into  fields  that take on certain specially classified shapes and characteristics in general these fields are more discernible from high altitudes than from ground level they can often be found in the following forms

along with adiabatic cooling that requires a lifting agent there are three major non-adiabatic mechanisms for lowering the temperature of the air to its dew point conductive radiational and evaporative cooling require no lifting mechanism and can cause condensation at surface level resulting in the formation of  there are several main sources of water vapor that can be added to the air as a way of achieving saturation without any cooling process  water or moist ground precipitation or virga and  from plants

global cloud cover averaged over the month of october 2009  composite satellite image 






these maps display the fraction of earth s area that was cloudy on average during each month from january 2005 to august 2013 the measurements were collected by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer  modis  on nasa s terra satellite colors range from blue  no clouds  to white  totally cloudy  like a digital camera modis collects information in gridded boxes or pixels cloud fraction is the portion of each pixel that is covered by clouds colors range from blue  no clouds  to white  totally cloudy   click for more detail 


although the local distribution of clouds can be significantly influenced by topography the global prevalence of cloud cover tends to vary more by  it is most prevalent globally in and along low pressure zones of surface atmospheric convergence which encircle the earth close to the  and near the 50th parallels of latitude in the northern and southern  the adiabatic cooling processes that lead to the creation of clouds by way of lifting agents are all associated with convergence  a process that involves the horizontal inflow and accumulation of air at a given location as well as the rate at which this happens near the equator increased cloudiness is due to the presence of the low-pressure   itcz  where very warm and unstable air promotes mostly cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds clouds of virtually any type can form along the mid-latitude convergence zones depending on the stability and moisture content of the air these extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the  where  of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin this leads to the formation of weather-making  composed of cloud systems that may be stable or unstable to varying degrees according to the stability characteristics of the various airmasses that are in conflict divergence along high pressure zones

divergence is the opposite of convergence in the earth s atmosphere it involves the horizontal outflow of air from the upper part of a rising column of air or from the lower part of a subsiding column often associated with an area or ridge of high pressure cloudiness tends to be least prevalent near the poles and in the subtropics close to the 20th parallels north and south the latter are sometimes referred to as the  the presence of a large-scale high-pressure  on each side of the equator reduces cloudiness at these low latitudes similar patterns also occur at higher latitudes in both hemispheres luminance reflectivity and coloration 
the luminance or brightness of a cloud is determined by how light is reflected scattered and transmitted by the cloud s particles its brightness may also be affected by the presence of haze or photometeors such as halos and rainbows in the troposphere dense deep clouds exhibit a high reflectance  70 to 95  throughout the  tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out giving a cloud its characteristic white color especially when viewed from the top cloud droplets tend to  light efficiently so that the intensity of the  decreases with depth into the gases as a result the  can vary from a very light to very-dark-grey depending on the cloud s thickness and how much  is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer high thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white appearance however a thick dense ice-crystal cloud appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater reflectivity as a tropospheric cloud matures the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets if the droplets become too large and heavy to be kept aloft by the air circulation they will fall from the cloud as  by this process of accumulation the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud if the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart a percentage of the light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look a simple example of this is one s being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog this process of   is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black striking cloud colorations can be seen at any altitude with the color of a cloud usually being the same as the incident light during daytime when the sun is relatively high in the sky tropospheric clouds generally appear bright white on top with varying shades of grey underneath thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their  or background red orange and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere when the sun is just below the horizon low-level clouds are gray middle clouds appear rose-colored and high clouds are white or off-white clouds at night are black or dark grey in a moonless sky or whitish when illuminated by the moon they may also reflect the colors of large fires city lights or auroras that might be present a cumulonimbus cloud that appears to have a greenish or bluish tint is a sign that it contains extremely high amounts of water  hail or rain which scatter light in a way that gives the cloud a blue color a green colorization occurs mostly late in the day when the sun is comparatively low in the sky and the incident sunlight has a reddish tinge that appears green when illuminating a very tall bluish cloud supercell type storms are more likely to be characterized by this but any storm can appear this way coloration such as this does not directly indicate that it is a severe thunderstorm it only confirms its potential since a green blue tint signifies copious amounts of water a strong updraft to support it high winds from the storm raining out and wet hail  all elements that improve the chance for it to become severe can all be inferred from this in addition the stronger the updraft is the more likely the storm is to undergo tornadogenesis and to produce large hail and high winds yellowish clouds may be seen in the troposphere in the late spring through early fall months during  season the yellow color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke yellowish clouds are caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide and are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels

the role of tropospheric clouds in regulating  and  remains a leading source of uncertainty in  projections this uncertainty arises because of the delicate balance of processes related to clouds spanning scales from millimeters to planetary hence interactions between large-scale weather events   and clouds becomes difficult to represent in global models the complexity and diversity of clouds as outlined above adds to the problem on the one hand white-colored cloud tops promote cooling of earth s surface by reflecting short-wave radiation from the sun most of the sunlight that reaches the ground is absorbed warming the surface which emits radiation upward at longer infrared wavelengths at these wavelengths however water in the clouds acts as an efficient absorber the water reacts by radiating also in the infrared both upward and downward and the downward long-wave radiation results in some warming at the surface this is analogous to the  of  and  high-level genus-types particularly show this duality with both short-wave  cooling and long-wave greenhouse warming effects on the whole though ice-crystal clouds in the upper troposphere tend to favor net warming however the cooling effect is dominant with mid-level and low clouds made of very small water droplets with an average radius of about 2m  0.00008in  especially when they form in extensive sheets that block out more of the sun small-droplet aerosols are not good at absorbing long-wave radiation reflected back from earth so there is a net cooling with almost no long-wave effect this effect is particularly pronounced with low clouds that form over water measurements taken by nasa indicate that on the whole the effects of low and mid-level clouds that tend to promote cooling are outweighing the warming effects of high layers and the variable outcomes associated with or vertically developed clouds low and vertical heaps of cumulus towering cumulus and cumulonimbus are made of larger water droplets ranging in radius from 5 to about 15m nimbostratus cloud droplets can also be quite large up to 15m radius these larger droplets associated with vertically developed clouds are better able to trap the long-wave radiation thus mitigating the cooling effect to some degree however these large often precipitating clouds are variable or unpredictable in their overall effect because of variations in their concentration distribution and vertical extent as difficult as it is to evaluate the effects of current cloud cover characteristics on climate change it is even more problematic to predict the outcome of this change with respect to future cloud patterns and events as a consequence much research has focused on the response of low and vertical clouds to a changing climate leading global models can produce quite different results however with some showing increasing low-tage clouds and others showing decreases for global brightening see  above the troposphere




stratospheric nacreous clouds over antarctica


 show little variation in structure and are limited to a single very high range of altitude of about 15,00025,000m  49,20082,000ft  so they are not classified into altitude levels genus types species or varieties in the manner of tropospheric clouds polar stratospheric clouds form in the lowest part of the stratosphere during the  at the altitude and during the season that produces the coldest temperatures and therefore the best chances of triggering condensation caused by adiabatic cooling they are typically very thin with an undulating cirriform appearance moisture is scarce in the stratosphere so nacreous and non-nacreous cloud at this altitude range is rare and is usually restricted to polar regions in the winter where the air is coldest polar mesospheric

 form at a single extreme altitude range of about 80 to 85km  50 to 53mi  and are consequently not classified into more than one level they are given the latin name  because of their illumination well after sunset and before sunrise they typically have a bluish or silvery white coloration that can resemble brightly illuminated cirrus noctilucent clouds may occasionally take on more of a red or orange hue they are not common or widespread enough to have a significant effect on climate however an increasing frequency of occurrence of noctilucent clouds since the 19th century may be the result of climate change noctilucent clouds are the highest in the atmosphere and form near the top of the mesosphere at about ten times the altitude of tropospheric high clouds from ground level they can occasionally be seen illuminated by the sun during deep  ongoing research indicates that convective lift in the mesosphere is strong enough during the polar  to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapour to the point of saturation this tends to produce the coldest temperatures in the entire atmosphere just below the mesopause these conditions result in the best environment for the formation of polar mesospheric clouds there is also evidence that smoke particles from burnt-up meteors provide much of the condensation nuclei required for the formation of noctilucent cloud distribution in the mesosphere is similar to the stratosphere except at much higher altitudes because of the need for maximum cooling of the water vapor to produce noctilucent clouds their distribution tends to be restricted to polar regions of earth a major seasonal difference is that convective lift from below the mesosphere pushes very scarce water vapor to higher colder altitudes required for cloud formation during the respective summer seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres sightings are rare more than 45 degrees south of the north pole or north of the south pole
