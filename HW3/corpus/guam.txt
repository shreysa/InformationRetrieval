two aspects of indigenous pre-hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule  and inafa maolek chenchule  is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of chamorro society it is rooted in the core value of inafa maolek historian lawrence cunningham in 1992 wrote  in a chamorro sense the land and its produce belong to everyone  or interdependence is the key or central value in chamorro culture inafa maolek depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing this is the armature or core that everything in chamorro culture revolves around it is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than  and private property rights 
the core culture or pengngan chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect  from sniffing over the hands of the elders  called mangnginge in chamorro  the passing down of legends chants and courtship rituals to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds other practices predating spanish conquest include  canoe-making making of the   a string musical instrument made from a gourd  fashioning of cho  atupat slings and slingstones tool manufacture  burial rituals and preparation of herbal medicines by  master craftsmen and women specialize in weavings including plaited work   andleaf baskets mats bags hats and food containments  loom-woven material   and banana fiber skirts belts and burial shrouds  and body ornamentation  bead and shell necklaces bracelets earrings belts and combs made from tortoise shells and   the cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern guam poses challenges for chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation the increasing numbers of chamorros especially chamorro youth relocating to the u.s mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of chamorro identity  while only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms the resurgence of interest among the chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the chamorro people sports

in 1899 the local postage stamps were overprinted  guam  as was done for the other former spanish colonies but this was discontinued shortly thereafter and regular u.s postage stamps have been used ever since because guam is also part of the u.s postal system   gu   9691096932  mail to guam from the u.s mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required private shipping companies such as fedex ups and dhl however have no obligation to do so and do not regard guam as domestic the speed of mail traveling between guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year light first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland but larger first-class or priority items can take a week or two fourth-class mail such as magazines are transported by sea after reaching hawaii most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available incoming mail not from the americas should be addressed to  guam  instead of  usa  to avoid being routed the long way through the u.s mainland and possibly charged a higher rate  especially from asia  the commercial port of guam is the island s lifeline because most products must be shipped into guam for consumers it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii-based shipping line  whose container ships connect guam with honolulu hawaii los angeles california oakland california and seattle washington the port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000 customers throughout the micronesian region the port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the island s u.s department of defense installations andersen air force base and commander naval forces marianas and eventually the third marine expeditionary force guam is served by the  which is a hub for  the island is outside the united states customs zone so guam is responsible for establishing and operating its own customs and quarantine agency and jurisdiction therefore the  only carries immigration  but not customs  functions since guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction passengers arriving directly from the united states skip immigration and proceed directly to guam customs and quarantine however due to the  for certain countries an eligibility pre-clearance check is carried on guam for flights to the states for travel from the northern mariana islands to guam a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to guam on flights from guam to the northern mariana islands no immigration check is performed traveling between guam and the states through a foreign point however does require a passport most residents travel within guam using personally owned vehicles the local government currently outsources the only public bus system   and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locations
ecology







believed to be a  on a u.s military transport near the end of world war ii the   boiga irregularis  was accidentally introduced to guam which previously had no native species of snake it nearly eliminated the native bird population the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island the brown tree snake known locally as the kulebla is native to northern and eastern coasts of   and the  it is slightly venomous but relatively harmless to human beings  it is nocturnal although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam residents rarely see them the  has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island s cargo flow the  also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region s islands before the introduction of the brown tree snake guam was home to several endemic bird species among them were the   or ko ko  bird in chamorro  and the  both common throughout the island today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction according to many elders ko ko  birds were common in guam before world war ii other bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the  the  and the  though populations are present on other islands including rota guam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands because their natural predators birds are severely diminished and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of

efforts have been made to protect guam s coral reef habitats from pollution eroded silt and overfishing problems that have led to decreased fish populations  since guam is a significant vacation spot for  this is important  in recent years the department of agriculture division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists before adopting  standards portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests tumon bay has since been made into a preserve a federal  in northern guam protects the decimated  population in addition to a small colony of  harvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on guam before world war ii the   chelonia mydas  was harvested legally on guam before august 1978 when it was listed as threatened under the endangered species act the   eretmochelys imbricata  has been on the endangered list since 1970 in an effort to ensure protection of sea turtles on guam routine sightings are counted during aerial surveys and nest sites are recorded and monitored for hatchlings
