intermittent assertions proving program correctness paper explores technique proving correctness termination programs simultaneously approach intermittent-assertion method involves documenting program assertions true time control passes point need true time method introduced Burstall, promises provide valuable complement conventional methods intermittent-assertion method presented number examples correctness termination proofs proofs markedly simpler conventional counterparts hand shown proof correctness termination conventional techniques rephrased directly proof intermittent assertions Finally, shown intermittent-assertion method applied prove validity program transformations correctness continuously operating programs cacm February, 1978 Manna, Z.
