lake ontario is the easternmost of the great lakes and the smallest in surface area  7,340sqmi 18,960km2  although it exceeds  in volume  393 cumi 1,639km3  it is the  when its islands are included the lake has a shoreline that is 712 miles  1,146km  long as the last lake in the great lakes  hydrologic chain lake ontario has the lowest mean surface elevation of the lakes at 243 feet  74m  above sea level  326 feet  99m  lower than its  its maximum length is 193   311   168   and its maximum width is 53 statute miles  85km  46nmi  the lake s average depth is 47  1 foot  283ft  86 m  with a maximum depth of 133 fathoms 4 feet  802ft  244 m  the lake s primary source is the  draining lake erie with the st lawrence river serving as the outlet the drainage basin covers 24,720squaremiles  64,030km2  as with all the great lakes water levels change both within the year  owing to seasonal changes in water input  and among years  owing to longer term trends in precipitation  these water level fluctuations are an integral part of lake ecology and produce and maintain extensive wetlands the lake also has an important freshwater fishery although it has been negatively affected by factors including over-fishing water pollution and invasive species  built by prevailing winds and currents have created a significant number of  and sheltered harbors mostly near  but not limited to   and the easternmost shores perhaps the best-known example is  chosen as the site of the   ontario  capital for its strategic harbour other prominent examples include    and  the bars themselves are the sites of long beaches such as  and  these sand bars are often associated with large  which support large numbers of plant and animal species as well as providing important rest areas for migratory birds presqu ile on the north shore of lake ontario is particularly significant in this regard one unique feature of the lake is the z-shaped  which separates prince edward county from the ontario mainland save for a 2-mile  3.2km  isthmus near trenton  this feature also supports many wetlands and aquatic plants as well as associated fisheries major rivers draining into lake ontario include the niagara river         and the  geology

the lake basin was carved out of soft weakage rocks by the  ice sheet during the last  the action of the ice occurred along the pre-glacial  valley which had approximately the same orientation as today s basin  that was pushed southward by the ice sheet left landforms such as   and  both on the modern land surface and the lake bottom reorganizing the region s entire drainage system as the ice sheet retreated toward the north it still dammed the st lawrence valley outlet so that the lake surface was at a higher level this stage is known as  during that time the lake drained through present-day syracuse new york into the  thence to the hudson river and the atlantic the shoreline created during this stage can be easily recognized by the  now dry   and wave-cut hills 10 to 25 miles  15 to 40km  from the present shoreline when the ice finally receded from the st lawrence valley the outlet was below  and for a short time the lake became a  of the atlantic ocean in association with the  gradually the land  from the release of the weight of about 6,500 feet  2,000m  of ice that had been stacked on it it is still rebounding about 12inches  30cm  per century in the st lawrence area since the ice receded from the area last the most rapid rebound still occurs there this means that the lake bed is gradually tilting southward inundating the south shore and  both north and south shores experience shoreline erosion but the tilting amplifies this effect on the south shore causing loss to property owners history

the name ontario is derived from the  word ontar io which means  great lake  the lake was a border between the  people and the  confederacy in the  in the 1600s the iroquois drove out the huron from southern ontario and  when the iroquois withdrew and the  moved in from the north to southern ontario they retained the iroquois name it is believed that the first european to reach the lake was  in 1615 as was their practice the french explorers introduced other names for the lake in 1632 and 1656 the lake was referred to as lac de st louis or lake st louis by  and   respectively  likely for   in 1660  historian  coined the name lacus ontarius in a map drawn in the relation des jsuites  16621663  the lake bears the legend  lac ontario ou des iroquois  with the name  ondiara  in smaller type a french map produced in 1712  currently in the   created by military engineer  identified lake ontario as  lac frontenac  named after louis de buade comte de frontenac et de palluau he was a french soldier courtier and governor general of new france from 1672 to 1682 and from 1689 to his death in 1698 artifacts which are believed to be of  origin have been found in the area of  indicating the possibility of trading by the indigenous peoples with norse explorers on the east coast of north america a series of trading posts were established by both the british and french such as   kingston  in 1673  in 1722   toronto  in 1750 after the  all forts around the lake were under british control the united states did not take possession of forts on present-day american territory until the signing of the  in 1794 permanent non-military european settlement began during the  as the easternmost and nearest lake to the atlantic seaboard of canada and the united states population centres here are among the oldest in the great lakes basin with  formerly the  dating to the 1670s  fort frontenac  the lake became a hub of commercial activity following the  with canal building on both sides of the border and heavy travel by lake steamers steamer activity peaked in the mid-19th century before competition from railway lines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries a type of scow known as a stone hooker was in operation on the north-west shore particularly around  and   was the practice of raking flat fragments of dundas shale from the shallow lake floor of the area for use in construction particularly in the growing city of toronto ecology and environmental concerns 




wetlands on a lakeshore


the great lakes watershed is a region of high biodiversity and lake ontario is important for its diversity of birds fish reptiles amphibians and plants many of these special species are associated with shorelines particularly sand dunes lagoons and wetlands the importance of wetlands to the lake has been appreciated and many of the larger wetlands have protected status however these wetlands are changing in part because the natural water level fluctuations have been reduced many wetland plants are dependent upon low water levels to reproduce when water levels are stabilized the area and diversity of the marsh is reduced this is particularly true of meadow marsh  also known as wet meadow wetlands  for example in eel bay near alexandria bay regulation of lake levels has resulted in large losses of wet meadow often this is accompanied by the invasion of  which displace many of the native plant species and reduce plant diversity  may accelerate this process by providing nitrogen and phosphorus for the more rapid growth of competitively dominant plants similar effects are occurring on the north shore in wetlands such as  which have interdunal wetlands called  with high plant diversity and many unusual plant species most of the forests around the lake are  dominated by trees including maple oak beech ash and basswood these are classified as part of the  by environment canada or as the  by the united states environmental protection agency or as the great lakes ecoregion by the nature conservancy deforestation in the vicinity of the lake has had many negative impacts including loss of forest birds extinction of native salmon and increased amounts of sediment flowing into the lake in some areas more than 90 percent of the forest cover has been removed and replaced by agriculture certain tree species such as hemlock have also been particularly depleted by past logging activity guidelines for restoration stress the importance of maintaining and restoring forest cover particularly along streams and wetlands the open water is less-affected by shoreline features such as wetlands and more affected by nutrient levels that control the production of algae algae are the basis of the open water food web and the source of primary production that ends up as lake trout and walleye at the top of the open water food web 



lake sturgeon were abundant in 1860 and had been driven to near extinction by 1960 

like the other great lakes lake ontario used to have an important commercial fishery it has been largely destroyed mostly by over-fishing consider the  as but one example lake sturgeon are huge fishthey can grow up to three meters long and exceed 190kg in weight the females mature slowly and require decades to reach sexual maturity it was once an abundant species in lake ontario  in 1860 this species taken on incidental catches of other fishes was killed and dumped back in the lake piled up on shore to dry and be burned fed to pigs or dug into the earth as fertilizer  it was even stacked like cordwood and used to fuel steamboats once its value was realized  they were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trapnets poundnets and gillnets  over 5 million pounds were taken from adjoining lake erie in a single year the fishery collapsed largely by 1900 they have never recovered like most sturgeons the lake sturgeon is rare now and is protected in many areas populations in the oswego river are being actively managed for recovery 



lake ontario food web


this food web has been damaged not only by over-fishing and changes in nutrient levels but also by other types of pollution from industrial chemicals agricultural fertilizers untreated sewage  from laundry detergents and pesticides some pollutant chemicals that have been found in the lake include   and other pesticides        and  the international joint commission has identified areas where pollution is particularly intense  point sources  and mapped them as  a remedial action plan has been developed for each area some lake ontario areas of concern include the  and rochester embayment on the american side and  and toronto on the canadian side 
by the 1960s and 1970s the increased pollution caused frequent  to occur in the summer these blooms killed large numbers of  and left decomposing piles of  and dead fish along the shores at times the blooms became so thick that waves could not break fish eating birds such as osprey bald eagle and cormorant were being poisoned by contaminated fish since the 1960s and 1970s environmental concerns have forced a cleanup of industrial and municipal wastes cleanup has been accomplished through better treatment plants tighter environmental regulations  and increased public awareness today lake ontario has recovered some of its pristine quality  for example  a fish species considered as a marker of clean water are now found however regional airshed pollution remains a concern the lake has also become an important sport  although with introduced species   and   rather than the native species bald eagle and osprey populations are also beginning to recover  are a problem for lake ontario particularly  and  lamprey are being controlled by poisoning in the juvenile stage in the streams where they breed zebra mussels in particular are difficult to control and pose major challenges for the lake and its waterways climate 
the lake has a natural  rhythm of eleven minutes the seiche effect normally is only about 34 inches  2cm  but can be greatly amplified by earth movement winds and atmospheric pressure changes because of its great depth the lake as a whole never freezes in winter but an ice sheet covering between 10 and 90 of the lake area typically develops depending on the severity of the winter ice sheets typically form along the shoreline and in slack water bays where the lake is not as deep during the winters of 1877 and 1878 the ice sheet coverage was up to 95100 in most of the lake in the  the ice cover was stable enough that the american naval commander stationed at sackets harbor feared a british attack from  over the ice when the cold winds of winter pass over the warmer water of the lake they pick up moisture and drop it as  snow since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake is referred to as the  in some winters the area between oswego and  may receive twenty or more feet  600cm  of snowfall also impacted by lake-effect snow is the  an area of elevated land that is about 20 miles  32km  east of lake ontario creating ideal conditions for lake-effect snowfall the  hill  as it is often referred to typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern united states as a result tug hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as  with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the united states other cities in the world receive more snow annually such as  which averages 135 inches  340cm  and   which receives 250 inches  640cm  each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world foggy conditions  particularly in fall  can be created by thermal contrasts and can be an impediment for recreational boaters in a normal winter lake ontario will be at most one quarter ice-covered in a mild winter almost completely unfrozen lake ontario has completely frozen over on five recorded occasions  from about january 20 to about march 20 1830  in 1874  in 1893  in 1912  and in february 1934 lake breezes in spring tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past and in the autumn delay the onset of fall frost particularly on the south shore cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season protecting them from possible frost damage such  effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area     and  are grown in many commercial  around rochester between  and  on the niagara peninsula is a  the  extends over the international border into  and  counties apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake s north shore around  settlements
