tropical cyclone 07p 

on january 6 the npmoc reported that tropical cyclone 07p had developed out of an area of low pressure that had persisted for several days near  with peak windspeeds of 55km h  35mph  equivalent to a tropical depression during the next day the depression remained broad and poorly organized as it moved towards the southeast later that day 07p moved across tonga s northern islands before the npmoc issued their final advisory on january 8 as the system weakened into a remnant low 
severe tropical cyclone sarah 

on january 18 a weak low pressure area developed to the north of fiji within a trough of low pressure that extended from a weakening cyclone rewa to the northwest of fiji over the next few days the low moved towards the west and passed between the vanuation islands of vila and santo on january 21 once the low had moved into the coral sea it started to rapidly develop further with both rsmc nadi and the jtwc reporting early on january 22 that the low had developed into a tropical cyclone with the latter naming it sarah

tropical cyclone usha 

late on march 24 the newly developed tropical cyclone usha moved into the south pacific basin as a category 1 tropical cyclone 
tropical depression 29p 

on april 20 the jtwc started to monitor an area of low pressure that located over the solomon islands about 155km  95mi  to the north of  during that day the disturbance moved towards the southeast and passed over several of the solomon islands before emerging into the australian basin over the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed further while moving towards the southwest before re-curving and moving southeastwards on april 24 as it moved back into the south pacific basin the jtwc initiated advisories on the disturbance designating it as tropical cyclone 29p with peak windspeeds equivalent to a tropical depression as the system was classified it recurved again and started to move slowly towards the northwest and started to feel the effects of a high amount of vertical windshear as a result of the windshear the center became exposed and displaced from the deep convection before the jtwc issued their final advisory on april 25 as 29p weakened into an area of low pressure before dissipating later that day about 600km  375mi  to the southwest of honiara 
season effects 
this table lists all the storms that developed in the south pacific basin during the 199394 season it includes their intensity on the  duration name areas affected deaths and damages for most storms the data is taken from tcwc nadi and wellingtons archives however data for 07p and 29p has been taken from the jtwc and the npmoc archives as opposed to tcwc nadi brisbane and wellingtons and thus the winds are over 1-minute as opposed to 10-minutes
