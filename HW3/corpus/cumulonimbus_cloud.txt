cumulonimbus from the  cumulus  heap  and nimbus  rainstorm   storm cloud  is a dense towering vertical  associated with  and  forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents if observed during a storm these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads cumulonimbus can form alone in clusters or along  these clouds are capable of producing  and other dangerous severe weather such as  cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped  and may further develop as part of a  cumulonimbus is abbreviated cb

appearance 
towering cumulonimbus clouds are typically accompanied by smaller  clouds the cumulonimbus base may extend several miles across and occupy low to middle altitudes formed at altitude from approximately 200 to 4,000m  700 to 10,000ft  peaks typically reach to as much as 40,000ft  12,000m  with extreme instances as high as 70,000ft  21,000m  or more well-developed cumulonimbus clouds are characterized by a flatlike top  anvil dome  caused by wind shear or  near the  the shelf of the anvil may precede the main cloud s vertical component for many miles and be accompanied by  occasionally rising air parcels surpass the equilibrium level  due to momentum  and form an  culminating at the  when vertically developed this largest of all clouds usually extends through all three cloud regions even the smallest cumulonimbus cloud dwarfs its neighbors in comparison species

effects

cumulonimbus storm cells can produce torrential  of a  nature  often in the form of a   and  as well as  most storm cells die after about 20minutes when the  causes more downdraft than updraft causing the energy to dissipate if there is enough  in the  however  on a hot summer s day for example  the moisture from one storm cell can  rapidlyresulting in a new cell forming just a few miles from the former one this can cause thunderstorms to last for several hours cumulonimbus clouds can also bring dangerous winter storms  called   which bring lightning thunder and torrential snow however cumulonimbus clouds are most common in tropical regions life cycle or stages 
in general cumulonimbus require moisture an unstable air mass and a lifting force  heat  in order to form cumulonimbus typically go through three stages  the developing stage the mature stage  where the main cloud may reach  status in favorable conditions  and the dissipation stage the average thunderstorm has a 24km  15mi  diameter depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go through
