taipei 101 is designed to withstand the  winds and earthquake tremors that are common in the area east of taiwan evergreen consulting engineering the structural engineer designed taipei 101 to withstand gale winds of 60 metres per second  197ft s   216km h or 134mph  as well as the strongest earthquakes in a 2,500-year cycle taipei 101 was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant because while flexibility prevents structural damage resistance ensures comfort for the occupants and for the protection of glass  and other features most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing because of the height of taipei 101 combined with the surrounding area s geologythe building is located just 660ft  200m  away from a major fault linetaipei 101 used high-performance steel construction and 36 columns including eight  mega-columns  packed with 10,000psi  69mpa  concrete outrigger trusses located at eight-floor intervals connect the columns in the building s core to those on the exterior these features combined with the solidity of its  made taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed the foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven 80m  262ft  into the ground extending as far as 30m  98ft  into the bedrock each pile is 1.5m  5ft  in diameter and can bear a load of 1,0001,320   1,1001,460   during construction on 31 march 2002 a 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked taipei  two construction cranes from the 56th floor the highest floor at the time toppled five people died in the accident but an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction soon resumed  designed a 660-tonne  728-short-ton  steel pendulum that serves as a  at a cost of nt 132million  us 4million  suspended from the 92nd to the 87th floor the pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts its sphere the largest damper sphere in the world consists of 41 circular steel plates of varying diameters each 125mm  4.92in  thick welded together to form a 5.5m  18ft  diameter sphere two additional tuned mass dampers each weighing 6 tonnes  7 short tons  are installed at the tip of the spire which help prevent damage to the structure due to strong wind loads on 8 august 2015 strong winds from  swayed the main damper by 100 centimetres  39in  the largest movement ever recorded by the damper the damper has become such a popular tourist attraction the city contracted  to create a mascot  the damper baby four versions of the damper baby   rich gold   cool black   smart silver  and  lucky red  were designed and made into figurines and souvenirs sold in various taipei 101 gift shops damper baby with its cute all-ages appeal has become a popular local icon with its own comic book and website structural faade

taipei 101 s characteristic blue-green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed offer heat and  protection sufficient to block external heat by 50 percent and can sustain impacts of 7 tonnes  8 short tons  the faade system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined moment-resisting lattices contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega-columns with one-story high trusses at every eighth floor this faade system is therefore able to withstand up to 95mm  4in  of seismic lateral displacements without damage the original corners of the faade were tested at  in  a simulation of a 100-year storm at rwdi revealed a vortex that formed during a 3-second 105 miles per hour  169km h  wind at a height of 10 meters or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large   a double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation resulting in the final design s  double stairstep  corner faade architect c.y lee also used extensive faade elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued these faade elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors a  and a money box symbol between the two faade sections among others taipei 101 s own roof and faade recycled water system meets 20 to 30 percent of the building s water needs in july 2011 taipei 101 was certified  the world s tallest green building  under  standards symbolism 




taipei 101 in the skyline 

the height of 101 floors commemorates the renewal of time  the new century that arrived as the tower was built  100 1  and all the new years that follow  1 january   1-01  it symbolizes high ideals by going one better on 100 a traditional number of perfection the number also evokes the  used in digital technology the main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each in chinese-speaking cultures the number  is associated with  the repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an asian   a tower linking earth and sky also evoked in the petronas towers  a stalk of   an icon of learning and growth  and a stack of ancient chinese ingots or money boxes  a symbol of abundance  popular humor sometimes likens the building s shape to a stack of  as used in   of course the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes the four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins the emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient design with central holes shaped to imply the  1-0-1 the structure incorporates many shapes of squares and circles to reach a balance between yin and yang curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design  though the shape of each ruyi at taipei 101 is traditional its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern the ruyi is a  of ancient origin associated in art with  it connotes healing protection and fulfillment it appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights the sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the taipei 101 tower stands at least 8m  26ft  tall at night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts taipei 101 in the role of a candle or  upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome from 6 00 to 10 00 each evening the tower s lights display one of seven colours in the  the colors coincide with the days of the week
