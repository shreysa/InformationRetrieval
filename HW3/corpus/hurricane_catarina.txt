on march12 a  stationary upper-level  became established offshore of southern brazil a disturbance formed within the trough on the 19th and moved east-southeastward until the 22nd when a  to its southeast kept it stationary with exceptionally favorable upper level winds and slightly below average if marginally warm water temperatures from 24 to 26  75 to 79f  it gradually developed resembling a subtropical storm by the 24th located 630mi  1,015km  east-southeast of  it headed slowly westward and appeared to become a tropical storm on march25 a compact storm it continued westward while steadily intensifying the structure of the storm continued to improve and due to a definite  feature showing on satellites the storm was determined to have become a hurricane-equivalent cyclone on march26 a brazilian newspaper had a headline  furaco catarina   i.e  hurricane  catarina  partly because of this headline the storm was unofficially named catarina it continued to encounter favorable conditions and reached a peak of 100mph  155km h  estimated sustained winds on the 28th which made the storm the equivalent of a  on the  gusts peaked at around 120mph  195km h  the hurricane hit the southern coast of  and northeastern  with winds up to 195km h overnight after making landfall catarina rapidly dissipated over land in the normal manner of a tropical cyclone naming

further information  
brazilian meteorologists named the storm catarina for its proximity to  and eventual  near  the state of  although government forecasters initially denied that the storm which clearly had an open  and various other tropical morphologies was a hurricane at all more than a year after the storm made landfall brazilian meteorologists finally classified the storm as a  north american forecasters however surprised as they were considered this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence since catarina had a clear eyewall structure bounded by deep convective dense central overcast well-defined spiral outer bands and outflow structure warm water temperatures of 79f  26c  little shear a warm core low overall tropical characteristics and occurred in march  equivalent to september in the northern hemisphere the peak of hurricane season  it was considered to be a hurricane by the  in the  though it is most commonly known as catarina all names for this storm are  unofficial  in that noaffiliated meteorological agency that monitors hurricanes named it  tropical cyclone names are predetermined by an international committee of the   it has also been unofficially called  aldona  and the advisory names for it were  01t-alpha  from the  s  and  50l-noname  from the    which keeps it well outside normal designation which start at 01l for named storms and use 90l to 99l for  rare formation 
typically tropical cyclones do not form in the south  due to strong upper level shear cool water temperatures and the lack of a convergence zone of convection occasionally though as seen in  and  conditions can become slightly more favorable for catarina it was a combination of climatic and atmospheric anomalies water temperatures on catarina s path ranged from 24 to 25c slightly less than the 26.5c temperature of a normal tropical cyclone but sufficient for a storm of baroclinic origin to this day catarina is the only  tropical cyclone ever observed in the   since 1970 other systems have been observed in this region  however none have reached hurricane strength and no  were seen on satellite imagery or radar while catarina formed in an unusual area its relation to  or any other type of global climatic change is still up for debate the   attributed it to  climatic changes and atmospheric anomalies  while other researchers have indicated that it could be the result of the  or other seasonal variations in weather within the  again linked to global changes in climate however more research in the area is still needed to make a conclusion impact

like normal tropical cyclones catarina brought heavy flooding with it despite the uncertainty in the future of the storm brazilian officials took the appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the residents who lived along the coastline a successful evacuation was executed for numerous residents along the coast though some people decided to ride out the storm in their own homes the storm damaged around 40,000 homes and destroyed 1,500  40 of the rice crop were also lost total damages were estimated at  350 million  2004   444million 2017usd  it also killed at least three and injured at least 75 at least 2,000 people were left homeless following the storm at passo de torres many shipyards were destroyed as they were not designed to withstand the  differentials caused by catarina s winds  widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well near the  a house was blown about 50meters  165ft  upstream literally landing in another state  it originally was built in the torres municipality of  yet it ended up in passo de torres within santa catarina in rural areas the   and  fields received the most damage although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses as they had harvested before catarina made landfall overall almost 36,000residences were damaged as a result of catarina s onslaught  of those 993 collapsed completely the commercial sector fared slightly better as only 2,274buildings were damaged and 472 collapsed finally 397public buildings were damaged and three were destroyed these account for 26 of the total buildings in the region and property damage of  25.6million  2004 usd  325million 2017usd  four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse most of the damage was blamed on the low quality of the construction  brick residences typically lacked   or  for example the areas affected the most were those inhabited by low-income families usually with annual family salaries of less than  400usd see also
