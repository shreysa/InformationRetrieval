hurricane diane originated in a  first observed as a tropical depression on august7 between the  and  the system moved generally to the west-northwest intensifying into a tropical storm on august9 by the time the  first classified the storm on august10 diane was south of the  a semi-permanent  just east of  ships in the region of the storm reported winds of 45mph  72km h  during the next day the  reported no increase in strength and diane initially remained disorganized the storm interacted with  to its northwest in a process known as the  in which diane turned toward the north quick intensification ensued potentially due to interaction with a  that increased  on august12 the storm  into a hurricane the intensification was so quick that a ship southeast of the center believed diane was undergoing a loop due to a steady drop in  despite moving away from the hurricane at its peak diane developed a well-defined  about 30mi  48km  in diameter described by  as taking the shape of an  inverted teacup  the strongest winds were located in the northeast quadrant where there was a secondary pressure minimum located 62mi  100km  northeast of the eye after moving to the north for about a day diane resumed its westward motion on august13 after hurricane connie to the northwest had weakened that day diane reached its lowest pressure of 969mbar  28.6inhg  and peak winds of 105mph  170km h  originally the hurricane was analyzed to reach peak winds of 120mph  195km h  although the large size and slow forward speed suggested the lower winds it maintained its peak winds for about 12hours after which it weakened due to cooler air in the region by august15 the eye had become poorly defined and winds steadily weakened as it approached land its center deteriorated with minimal precipitation near the center  the eye was observed on a radar installed in july 1955 on august17 diane made  on the coast of  near  pressure at landfall was estimated at 986 millibars  29.1inhg  accompanied by winds just under hurricane intensity diane struck the state only five days after hurricane connie struck the same general area diane quickly weakened as a tropical storm over the mountainous terrain of central north carolina the associated area of precipitation expanded and spread away from the center to the north and northeast the weakening system turned to the north and recurved toward the northeast through virginia after a ridge built in from the west it did not interact much with the non-tropical  and as a result it remained a distinct tropical cyclone over land convection redeveloped as the storm approached the atlantic coast once again diane passed through the  exiting new jersey on august19 into the atlantic ocean southeast of new york city paralleling the southern coast of  the storm later accelerated east-northeastward becoming  on august21 passing south and east of  the remnants of diane accelerated and restrengthened slightly while moving to the northeast late on august23 the storm dissipated between greenland and iceland

rainfall totals from hurricane diane


late on august14 more than two days before diane made landfall the  issued a hurricane alert from georgia through north carolina on august15 the agency issued a  from  to wilmington north carolina although the warning was later extended to the south and north to  and  respectively the agency also issued storm warnings southward to  and northward to  including the  and  bays throughout the warned region small ships were advised to remain at port before diane made landfall the north carolina national guard assisted in evacuating people near the  and 700residents left their homes near   thousands of tourists also evacuated the threat of the hurricane forced the planned retirement ceremony for   to be transferred from an aircraft carrier in  to an academy dormitory all aircraft at  were flown to safer locations further inland all hurricane warnings were dropped after diane moved inland forecasters downplayed the threat of diane after it weakened over virginia  the weather bureau agreed they did not foresee the extent of the rain that would occur instead calling for just  some local flooding  the agency later admitted they  goofed  in downplaying the storm s destructive potential after weakening noting their lack of experience with extreme rainfall events once the storm moved ashore the weather bureau transferred official forecasting duties to regional offices and local newspapers also issued their own forecasts the  in massachusetts noted that  moderate rains  possible  in its daily weather forecast ahead of the storm still flood warnings were issued with stream flooding forecasts of over 12hours in advance along smaller rivers including the   and  forecasts were issued every few hours in the summer of 1955 the eastern united states experienced generally hot and dry weather leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels when hurricane connie struck its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the mid-atlantic and new england hurricane diane struck north carolina just five days later and affected the same general area after floods in 1936 the united states federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods although they made no progress by the time connie and diane struck in 1955 along the delaware river in the 1930s state legislatures in new jersey and pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water but the legislators and commission blocked federal help comparing it to european   this was in contrast to the federally funded  which mitigated flooding along the  impact 
hurricane diane s path over the eastern united states brought heavy rainfall fueled by unusually moist air resulting from abnormally high  the worst flooding was in eastern pennsylvania northern new jersey southeastern new york and southern new england of the 287 in the region 129reported record levels during the course of the event many streams reported  rates of more than double the previous records most of the flooding occurred along small rivers that rose to flood stage within hours largely impacting populated areas  there were around 30million people in the region affected by the floods overall 813houses were destroyed with 14,000 heavily damaged the floods severed infrastructure and affected several summer camps damage to public utilities was estimated at  79million flooding in rural areas resulted in landslides in the mountains while destroyed crops cost an estimated  7million hundreds of miles of roads and bridges were also destroyed accounting for  82million in damage damage from diane s winds were generally minor the hurricane caused  754,706,000 in damage  1955  of which  600million was in new england making it the costliest hurricane in american history at the time taking into account indirect losses such as loss of wages and business earnings diane was described as  the first billion dollar hurricane  this contributed to 1955 being the costliest  on record at the time overall there were at least 184deaths potentially as many as 200 carolinas 
the strongest  associated with diane s landfall in north carolina reached 50mph  80km h  in  with gusts to 74mph  119km h  in wilmington any hurricane-force gusts were likely very sporadic and isolated in nature tides ran 6 to 8ft  1.8 to 2.4m  above normal near wilmington and waves 12ft  3.7m  in height struck the coast the resultant  damaged beach houses flooded coastal roads and destroyed seawalls damaged by hurricane connie a few days prior the center of the hurricane passed over wilmington without much of a decrease in winds suggesting the eye was disorganized or even nonexistent little precipitation fell in and around the city though precipitation was more substantial elsewhere in the state peaking at 7.04in  179mm  in new bern at  in neighboring south carolina rainfall amounted to 2.39in  61mm  mid-atlantic

aftermath 




rainfall totals in new england from diane


in diane s immediate aftermath one of the first priorities in response was to distribute adequate inoculations for  amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water the united states army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters after the floods of hurricane diane more than 100,000people fled to shelter or away from their houses the  quickly provided aid to the affected residents using churches and public buildings to house homeless people in the two weeks after the storm americans donated about  10million to the red cross the countries of great britain netherlands australia canada france austria and venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims sending emergency supplies additional flooding affected new england in september and october 1955 although neither was as major as those caused by hurricane diane following diane hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future   declared eight states as disaster areas making them eligible for federal aid the  opened 18temporary offices in the eastern united states for people to take out disaster loan applications in the months after the storm both the united states federal government and the american red cross had difficulty raising enough funds for the storm victims  collectively the red cross the small business administration and  raised  37million which was less than 8 of diane s damage total throughout 1955 the red cross assisted about 10,000families in new england and the mid-atlantic states  some of the families received aid to move to a new house not in a flood zone the small business administration provided about 1,600loans totaling  25million for small businesses   proposed a  12billion  in 1956 the  passed the federal flood insurance act but the program was not enacted due to lack of funding a nationwide flood program was not enacted until the passage of the  after the floods from diane the american federal government provided funding for the  to construct dams and reservoirs throughout new england to mitigate future flooding in about 14years the corps built 29dams in connecticut alone at the cost of  70million including three along the connecticut river the federal government restored plans from the 1930s to build dams along the delaware river one of which along  a  arose there due to the 40mi  64km  long reservoir the dam would have created causing 600families to be displaced the project was canceled in 1975 and the acquired lands became the  in pennsylvania washed-out rail lines prevented operation along the delaware lackawanna and western railroad for several weeks and lines reopened after about two months the expense of reopening and the loss of being closed led to the railroad merging with the  to become the  in 1960 one stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people flooding along the lehigh river destroyed 15industrial plants which left more than 15,000people near allentown pennsylvania without work temporarily the mayor of  declared a state of emergency due to the floods ordering all businesses to close  soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply elsewhere the  was on duty on streets in damaged towns including 50 to prevent looting in upper black eddy which was one of the hardest hit towns helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at camp davis where many deaths occurred during the storm statewide thousands of people were left homeless in stroudsburg there was a food shortage and officials enacted a curfew after reports of looting in the same city water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims which later inspired a  proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack the state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage which lasted for about two years  this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the  the two taxes each an increase of 1 totaled  71million a part of which was set aside for future disasters the experience of the storm s aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for  in 1972 in new jersey   declared the floods as at the time the state s worst natural disaster after the naugatuck river flood in connecticut cut off communications and bridges the state was effectively cut in two the state s  used helicopters to rescue people governor  visited areas affected by the flooding due to the damage connecticut was declared a federal disaster area on august20 the declaration allocated  25million in assistance to the state governor ribicoff requested  34million in funds to rebuild and produce future flood mitigation projects  the state s funding was paid by a combination of  and tax increases including subsequent storms the 1955 floods cumulatively killed 91people and left 1,100families homeless flooding occurred in 67towns resulting in damage to 20,000families about 86,000people were left unemployed after the floods in winsted the buildings that were washed away along the south side of main street were never rebuilt massachusetts governor  also issued a state of emergency due to the widespread flooding damage as a result the state s national guard and the army corps assisted in cleanup and most roads took three weeks to clear residents in areas affected by diane s flooding were advised to boil water and not to use gas cooking equipment diane s historic rainfall resulted in the wettest month on record in boston with a total of 17in  430mm  a record that stands as of 2010  boston s 24hour total of 8.4in  210mm  remained the highest daily total as of 1996 following diane s floods cities in massachusetts enlarged  and improved draining systems as well as constructing   these systems helped mitigate against future flooding the name diane was  from the  naming list due to the damage from hurricanes in 1954 and 1955 including diane public outcry over storm damage led to the creation of the  in 1956 using a monetary  in 2010 united states dollars the damage from diane would be about  7.4billion which would have been the 17th highest in the united states accounting for inflation changes in personal wealth and population changes it is estimated diane would have caused  18billion in damage in 2010 or the 15th highest for a united states hurricane see also
