 as   former us army special forces soldier and a current cia contractor who has been   identified as an unreliable or dangerous agent  and now finds himself in his hometown of miami unable to leave with his assets frozen he is forced to live off his wits and any small investigative jobs he can find while he searches for answers about who has burned him and why highly skilled and extremely clever he can think on his feet often improvising electronic devices and using ordinary items ranging from duct tape to cake frosting in highly unorthodox ways to complete a job he has two  or as he puts it in one episode  thirty years of karate  and is  rated with anything that fires a bullet or holds an edge  he has an uncanny ability to assume cover identities working in numerous regional dialects and international accents  however he cannot speak spanish fluently he believes that his unhappy childhood largely at the hands of an abusive father has helped to make him into a natural covert operative while also making close relationships difficult for him he has a younger brother nate   who appeared in several episodes before being killed by a sniper in season 6 michael presents himself as a cynic hardened by experience but occasionally reveals a soft and sometimes vulnerable side his favorite food is  which is featured or eaten by at least one of the characters in each episode he has a romantic relationship with fiona in the series finale he and fiona are living in ireland raising charlie  nate s son  as their own child  as   a former  operative and westen s ex-girlfriend fiona reenters michael s life when he is dumped in miami and she decides to stay quickly making herself valuable to him aside from serving as his firearms and explosives expert she provides support to him on his investigations and at times assists him in missions to find out who burned him in the pilot episode she speaks with an irish accent in the second episode she changes to an american accent along with a change in her style of dress in an effort to distance herself from her past and blend in showing her own ability to adapt she is both a complement to michael and his match in many ways both intellectually and tactically series creator  has said about michael and fiona s relationship 




the thing about the relationship with fiona is...they are two people who really don t have anybody else they can be with anybody else is going to be afraid of what michael does and it sort of turns her on and anybody else for michael is going to be uninteresting he is attracted to her but part of what we explore over the first season is they really are attracted with each other and yet there is a reason they broke up she is an incredibly chaotic person who just thrives on disorder violence is foreplay for her matt nix




where michael is concerned fiona is not entirely willing to let go of their past relationship which continues to simmer in the latter half of season 3 it is shown that the two of them are close to reigniting their relationship as season 5 starts the two move in together but tension in their romantic relationship remains however she is accused of the  bombings as the antagonist anson fullerton tricks her into confessing to a crime she did not commit anson uses this leverage over michael and forces him to do work for himself to remove this leverage fiona eventually surrenders and is  by the  as michael watches in vain in the series finale she and michael are living happily and raising charlie as their son 

 as   an aging semi-retired covert operative and former  with a low amount of cash-on-hand to his name sam spends most of his time sleeping with rich older miami women in exchange for food and shelter he and westen are old buddies  sam is also westen s last tenuous contact in the official spy community he presents himself as  the guy who knows a guy  and michael frequently relies on sam s seemingly inexhaustible list of contacts sam also uses the alias   frequently during jobs it is revealed in the pilot that he is also an  informant reporting on westen under duress knowing this westen is able to pass false information to the fbi through sam who is glad to become his  at some point in the past sam foiled fiona s attempt to sell a large shipment of weapons to a libyan arms dealer costing her a good deal of money as a result fiona initially is very hostile towards him but the two eventually become very antagonistic friends sam will occasionally ask her for advice concerning his relationships with women and michael has said that the two of them make a good team  as   michael s mother  maddie  is a  retiree although attempting to keep a sense of gravitas and self-importance she is family-oriented and fully supports both of her sons in times of need as well as helping michael with his clients in the mid-season finale of the third season she considers leaving miami but realizes her significance to his business until the events that start the series she had only infrequent communication with michael noting in the pilot that michael has missed his father s funeral  by eight years  during the first few seasons michael does not relish her company but he gradually grows to appreciate her strength and love despite this her appeals for help are michael s one great weakness and she has the ability to persuade him to do as she wishes  as   seasons   a counterintelligence expert whom michael unwittingly burns when michael went looking for some classified files on a terrorist about whom jesse had information he comes to michael for help hoping to find and kill the people responsible for burning him and gradually becomes part of michael s team he briefly considers killing michael after discovering it was michael who burned him but instead grudgingly continues to work with the team as he and michael slowly reconcile he is eventually reinstated but soon finds he can no longer tolerate the  red tape  to do government work and takes a job with a private security firm while remaining a vital component of michael s team
