naomi was the first cyclone of the 1993 94 season forming early on 15 december 1993 the storm moved south and strengthened into a  before making landfall there was moderate damage and a fishing boat was disabled during the storm there were no deaths 
severe tropical cyclone rewa 

main article  
cyclone rewa formed on 26 december 1993 it looped around the coral sea for almost a month crossed new caledonia and the solomon island and dissipated on 21 january rewa was the longest-lived south pacific tropical cyclone on record lasting 25 days from 26 december to 21 january 
tropical cyclone oscar 

cyclone oscar was a weak system and only barely reached cyclone strength on 3 january 1994 for about a 12-hour period it moved on a generally west-southwest course parallel to the  and  coasts 
severe tropical cyclone pearl-farah 

on january11 a tropical low formed northwest of  it was named pearl a few hours later by the  the cyclone continued westward and reached a peak intensity of 155km h  100mph  as the system moved west of 90e mfr took over warning responsibility on january18 and renamed the cyclone farah at that time mfr estimated winds of about 120km h  75mph  after having moved westward due to a ridge to the south farah turned to the south upon entering the basin due to an approaching trough which previously absorbed edmea high wind shear caused rapid weakening and by january19 there was little remaining convection the next day farah weakened to tropical depression status and turned to the southeast the ridge built behind the trough causing the depression to stall and drift northward and by february22 farah dissipated 

severe tropical cyclone quenton 

tropical cyclone quenton began as a tropical low to the east of  on 22 january 1994 the low moved slowly west then on 25 january intensified to cyclone strength and moved southward across the indian ocean by early on the 29th the cyclone had dissipated 
tropical cyclone sadie 

early on 29 january the bom reported that a tropical low had developed within the monsoon trough about 50km  30mi  to the north of the  in the  during that day the low rapidly developed further as it moved south-eastwards before early on 29 january tcwc brisbane reported that the low had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it sadie as the system started to move southwards later that day the jtwc initiated advisories on cyclone sadie and designated it as tropical cyclone 14p while the system started to move towards the east and was near its peak 1-minute maximum sustained windspeeds of 85km h  50mph  early the next day cyclone sadie made landfall to the north of near normanton after tcwc brisbane had reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 85km h  50mph  after making landfall the system moved towards the south-southeast before weakening and degenerating into a tropical low rain depression later that day 
severe tropical cyclone theodore 

severe tropical cyclone theodore existed from 22 february to 28 february 
severe tropical cyclone sharon 

tropical cyclone sharon was the most intense cyclone in the western australian region during the 1993 94 season it formed about 1100km north of northwest cape on 12 march 1994 then rapidly intensified during the 14th while moving on a south-southwest path towards the west  coast during the 16th the cyclone rapidly weakened due to movement into a region of strong westerly wind shear cyclone warnings were issued for the west pilbara and upper west coast on the 16th but were cancelled on the morning of the 17th continued shearing and subsequent movement over cooler waters weakened the storm to below cyclone strength by the morning of the 18th 
tropical cyclone tim 

tropical cyclone tim was a very small weak system that moved on a generally westward path from south of sumatra to the  from 28 march to 3 april 1994 it passed about 100km to the south of  but its effects other than a wind shift were barely recognizable on the island 
severe tropical cyclone vivienne 

tropical cyclone vivienne formed from a tropical low that had moved westward across the timor sea it intensified rapidly during the afternoon and night of 5 april 1994 reaching maximum intensity on 8 april when it was located 550km to the north-northwest of broome its development from here on was hampered by vertical wind shear and vivienne moved on a generally west-southwest path parallel to but well offshore from the western australian coastline it dissipated on 13 april and no watches or warnings were issued 
tropical depression 29p 

on 20 april the jtwc started to monitor an area of low pressure that located over the solomon islands about 155km  95mi  to the north of  during that day the disturbance moved towards the southeast and passed over several of the solomon islands before emerging into the australian basin over the next couple of days the disturbance gradually developed further while moving towards the southwest before re-curving and moving southeastwards on 24 april as it moved back into the south pacific basin the jtwc initiated advisories on the disturbance designating it as tropical cyclone 29p with peak windspeeds equivalent to a tropical depression as the system was classified it recurved again and started to move slowly towards the northwest and started to feel the effects of a high amount of vertical windshear as a result of the windshear the center became exposed and displaced from the deep convection before the jtwc issued their final advisory on 25 april as 29p weakened into an area of low pressure before dissipating later that day about 600km  375mi  to the southwest of honiara 
tropical cyclone willy 

willy was a category 1 cyclone lasting from 26 april to 1 may 1994 that passed about 80km west of the cocos islands 
other systems 
during march 23 a weak tropical low developed within the south pacific convergence zone near papua new guinea s  within an area of favourable surface and upper air conditions for further development over the next day the system moved eastwards and gradually developed further before tcwc port moresby reported that the system had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the australian scale and named it usha during the next day as it moved out of the australian region season effects
