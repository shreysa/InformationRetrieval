most of the lexicon of portuguese is derived directly or through other romance languages from latin nevertheless because of its original  heritage and later the participation of portugal in the  it has some  words and adopted  from all over the world a number of portuguese words can still be traced to the  which included the    and  most of these words derived from  and are very often shared with  since both languages share a common origin in the medieval language of galician-portuguese a few of these words existed in latin as loanwords from a  source often  altogether these are over 1,000 words some verbs and toponymic names of towns rivers utensils and plants in the 5th century the iberian peninsula  the    was conquered by the   and  as they adopted the roman civilization and language however these people contributed with some 500  words to the lexicon many of these words are related to warfaresuch as espora  spur  estaca  stake  and guerra  war  from   spara  stakka and  wirro respectively the  influence also exists in  and  borne by visigoth sovereigns and their descendants and it dwells on placenames such has   and  where sinde and sende are derived from the germanic  sinths   military expedition  and in the case of resende the prefix re comes from germanic  reths   council  other examples of portuguese names surnames and town names of germanic  origin include henrique  vermoim mandim calquim baguim gemunde guetim sermonde and many more are quite common mainly in the old  and later  dominated regions covering today s northern half of portugal and  between the 9th and early 13th centuries portuguese acquired nearly 800 words from  by influence of  they are often recognizable by the initial  and include many common words such as aldeia  village  from  alai a  or from    aldias  alface  lettuce  from  alkhass armazm  warehouse  from  almakhzan and azeite  olive oil  from  azzait starting in the 15th century the portuguese maritime explorations led to the introduction of many loanwords from asian languages for instance catana  cutlass  from  katana and ch  tea  from   from the 16th to the 19th centuries because of the role of portugal as intermediary in the  and the establishment of large portuguese colonies in angola mozambique and brazil portuguese acquired several words of african and  origin especially names for most of the animals and plants found in those territories while those terms are mostly used in the former colonies many became current in european portuguese as well from  for example came kifumate   cafun  head caress   brazil  kusula   caula  youngest child   brazil  marimbondo  tropical wasp   brazil  and kubungula   bungular  to dance like a wizard   angola  from south america came batata   from   anans and abacaxi from  nan and  ib cati respectively  two species of   and pipoca   from  and tucano   from  tucan finally it has received a steady influx of loanwords from other european languages especially french and  these are by far the most important languages when referring to loanwords there are many examples such as  colchete croch  bracket crochet  palet  jacket  batom  lipstick  and fil filete  steak slice  rua  street  respectively from french crochet paletot bton filet rue  and bife  steak  futebol revlver stock estoque folclore from english beef football revolver stock

dry-cured presunto cru  and castelhano  castilian  from spanish melena  mane  fiambre and castellano before the last four decades brazilians adopted a greater number of loanwords from japanese and other european languages  due to the  affecting their demographics  and they were and are also more willing to adopt foreign terms that come from  than the portuguese while the degree of african tupian and other amerindian lexicon in brazilian portuguese is shown to be surprisingly lesser than that commonly expected of the said variant by the local africanist and indianist academia  that also has to some degree influenced the common sense of what gives a different cultural identity of brazilians in relation to the portuguese  so that its lexicon is almost identical  about 99  to that of european portuguese many portuguese settlers to colonial brazil were from northern and insular portugal apart from some historically important  from elsewhere in europe such as galicia france and the netherlands it should be noted that brazil received more european immigrants in its colonial history than the  between 1500 and 1760 700,000 europeans  overwhelmingly portuguese  settled in brazil

like  and  portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables  isolated vowels tend to be  and in some cases centralized when unstressed consonants 

phonetic notes

semivowels contrast with unstressed high vowels in verbal conjugation as in  eu  rio  i.u  and  ele  riu  iw  phonologists discuss whether their nature is vowel or consonant in most of brazil and angola the consonant hereafter denoted as   is realized as a    which  the vowel that precedes it    122  proposes that portuguese possesses labio-velar stops  k  and   as additional phonemes rather than sequences of a velar stop and  w  the consonant hereafter denoted as   has a variety of realizations depending on dialect in europe it is typically a    however a pronunciation as a    may be becoming dominant in urban areas there is also a realization as a    and the original pronunciation as an   also remains very common in various dialects a common realization of the word-initial  r  in the lisbon accent is a voiced uvular trill fricative   in brazil   can be   or  and may be voiceless unless between voiced sounds  it is usually pronounced as a   a   see also   s  and  z  are normally  as in english however a number of dialects in northern portugal pronounce  s  and  z  as    sounding somewhat like a soft   as in the romance languages of northern iberia a very few northeastern portugal dialects still maintain the medieval distinction between apical and laminal sibilants  written s ss and c z respectively  as a phoneme  t  only occurs in loanwords with a tendency for speakers to substitute in   however  is an  of  t  before  i  in a number of brazilian dialects similarly  is an allophone of  d  in the same contexts in northern and central portugal the voiced stops  b   d    are usually lenited to      and   respectively except at the beginning of words or after nasal vowels  a  occurs in spanish 
grammar 
main article  
a notable aspect of the grammar of portuguese is the verb morphologically more verbal inflections from classical latin have been preserved by portuguese than by any other major  the portuguese and spanish grammars are very close it also has some innovations not found in other romance languages  except galician and the fala 

the  has an iterative sense unique to the galician-portuguese language group it denotes an action or a series of actions that began in the past and are expected to keep repeating in the future for instance the sentence tenho tentado falar com ela would be translated to  i have been trying to talk to her  not  i have tried to talk to her  on the other hand the correct translation of the question  have you heard the latest news  is not  tem ouvido a ltima notcia  but ouviu a ltima notcia  since no repetition is implied  portuguese still uses the future  which developed from medieval  and in present-day spanish and galician has almost entirely fallen into disuse the future subjunctive appears in dependent clauses that denote a condition that must be fulfilled in the future so that the independent clause will occur english normally employs the present tense under the same circumstances 


se eu for eleito presidente mudarei a lei if i should be elected president i will change the law 

quando fores mais velho vais entender when you grow older you will understand 

the personal   infinitives can  according to their subject in  and  often showing who is expected to perform a certain action  cf  melhor voltares  it is better  to go back   melhor voltarmos  it is better  to go back  perhaps for this reason infinitive clauses replace subjunctive clauses more often in portuguese than in other romance languages 
writing system 

main article  
portuguese is written with 26 letters of the  making use of five  to denote stress vowel height contraction nasalization and etymological       and   the  was also formerly used in brazilian portuguese and can still be encountered in words derived from proper names in other languages such as anhangera and mlleriano accented characters and  are not counted as separate letters for  purposes spelling reforms
