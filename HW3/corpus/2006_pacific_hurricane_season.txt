seasonal forecast 


on may 22 2006 the  s  noaa    cpc  released their forecasts for the 2006  and pacific hurricane seasons the pacific season was expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in  which generally increased  across the basin noaa predicted a below-normal level of activity in the eastern pacific with 1216named storms of which 68 were expected to become hurricanes and 13 expected to become major hurricanes the  s  was also expected to be below average with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area they expected that neither  nor la nia would affect conditions significantly on may 15 the hurricane season began in the eastern pacific basin which is the area of the northern  east of 140 on june 1 the season began in the central pacific warning zone  between 140 and the   however no storms occurred in the region until july seasonal summary

on may27 12days into the season tropical depression one formed about 190miles  305km  south of acapulco it slowly organized and became a tropical storm with 45mph  75km h  sustained winds while named tropical cyclones in may are infrequent events aletta marked the seventh consecutive year to have a named cyclone form in may the storm moved toward the  coast in southwestern mexico prompting the mexican government to issue  between  and  aletta then became stationary over the  and  coastlines but it later turned to the west and dissipated on may30 aletta produced moderate rainfall across mexico including a 24-hour rainfall total of 3.94inches  100mm  in jacatepec oaxaca on may30 and 3.78inches  96mm  in la calera guerrero the next day there were no reports of damage flooding or casualties 
tropical depression two-e 

main article  
on the day after aletta dissipated a new area of disturbed weather developed off the southwest mexican coast high shear slowed the development of the system although it gained enough convection and organization to be classified as a tropical depression on june3 the depression strengthened to near tropical storm status as it approached the coast of southwestern mexico  however shear persisted over the system and it weakened before dissipating on june4 despite never becoming a named storm heavy rain occurred including a total of 19.13inches  486mm  measured in a 48hour period in acapulco mudslides and flash flooding were reported forcing 72people from their homes no deaths or serious damage was reported 
hurricane bud 
main article  

on july11 after over a month of inactivity a disturbance off the  developed into a tropical depression it moved west-northwestward for its entire duration quickly intensifying into a tropical storm and hurricane a clear well-defined  developed and bud became the first  of the season on july13 the hurricane attained peak winds of 125mph  205km h  although cooler waters and stable air caused a marked weakening trend by july15 bud weakened to tropical depression status and the next day it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area the remnants of bud produced light rainfall across  
hurricane carlotta 

a tropical wave exited africa on june30 and moved across the atlantic ocean without development on july9 while crossing central america into the eastern north pacific ocean thunderstorm activity increased and the system organized into tropical depression four-e early on july12 about 290mi  465km  south of   the large depression moved quickly to the west-northwest to the south of a  over northwestern mexico and its outer rainbands moved across the coast rainfall totals were less than 1inch  25mm  the depression intensified into tropical storm carlotta just six hours after forming by late on july12 the storm developed  and early on july13 carlotta attained hurricane status about 430mi  700km  south of the southern tip of the  as carlotta intensified the system became more compact and it reached peak winds of 85mph  140km h  on july13 an  formed in the center and the hurricane was briefly forecast to attain  status or a category3 on the  however carlotta weakened due to increased wind shear from  to its west and the eye and convection deteriorated carlotta briefly weakened to tropical storm status late on july14 although a decrease in shear allowed it to reintensify into a hurricane this was short-lived as the center moved into the area of cooler waters and carlotta again weakened to tropical storm status late on july15 the circulation became separated from the convection and carlotta weakened to tropical depression status on july16 and the next day generated into a remnant low the circulation continued generally westward dissipating on july20 about 1500mi  2400km  east of the hawaiian islands 
hurricane daniel 

main article  
on july16 a tropical disturbance formed far to the south of the  and quickly increased in convective activity and organization becoming a tropical depression the system continued to organize and was designated as a tropical storm the next day on july18 daniel attained hurricane status and two days later underwent rapid intensification  it reached  and was later upgraded further to category4 status on the  its peak intensity was 150mph  240km h  the hurricane underwent  which are internal mechanisms that occur in most intense hurricanes daniel later became an  which allowed it to maintain category4 status for longer than it otherwise would have it crossed over into the central pacific early on july24 and was predicted to affect hawaii as a tropical storm  however daniel encountered weak steering currents in the open ocean causing it to slow down considerably it rapidly degenerated to a tropical depression on july25 and the cphc issued its last advisory on july26 while the storm was still well to the east of hawaii its remnants later moved across the hawaiian islands dropping heavy rainfall and causing flooding west wailuaiki on maui recorded 3.87inches  98mm  in one day which was the highest daily rainfall total from the hurricane 
tropical storm emilia 

main article  
the origins of emilia were from a  that developed into a tropical depression on july21 a short distance off the coast of  it moved generally north-northwestward reaching tropical storm status on july22 and passing about 175mi  280km  southwest of  an  began to form that day and emilia reached peak winds of 65mph  105km h  it briefly weakened due to  although restrengthening occurred as the storm turned toward the  on july26 emilia again reached peak winds of 65mph  105km h  and shortly thereafter it passed about 60mi  95km  southwest of the southern tip of baja california it weakened as it turned into cooler waters first to tropical depression status on july27 and then to a convective-less remnant low on july28 the remnants dissipated on july31 about 495mi  800km  west-southwest of  in southwestern mexico emilia produced tropical storm force winds along the coastline rainfall in the southern portion of the baja california peninsula caused minor flooding and gusty winds caused damage to buildings and power lines moisture from emilia reached the southwestern united states thunderstorms and rainfall occurred across arizona causing flooding in southern california the storm dropped light rainfall which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire 
tropical storm fabio 

a tropical wave crossed the west coast of africa on july15 and entered the pacific on july25 convection increased on july28 and at 1800utc on july31 the system became tropical depression seven-e about 980miles  1,580km  southwest of the southern tip of the  six hours later the depression was upgraded to tropical storm fabio it moved westward due to a ridge to its north and on august1 fabio reached peak winds of 50mph  85km h  later the storm began weakening due to increased  and dry air on august3 fabio deteriorated to tropical depression status and later that day it degenerated into a remnant  the remnants continued westward moving across  on august7 although fabio did not impact land its remnants produced heavy rainfall in hawaii in a 24-hour period 2.89inches  73mm  of rainfall was recorded at  on the island of   this was the highest daily rainfall total for the month on the island however the heaviest precipitation fell on  on  where 15.08inches  383mm  fell in 24hours  this total alone was greater than all other monthly rainfall totals in the state the heavy rainfall flooded the  which forced the closure of the kuhio highway when a bridge was inundated on  the rainfall caused ponding on roadways and flooding along streams one flooded stream stranded 24hikers along a trail all of whom required rescue by helicopter 
tropical storm gilma 

on july17 a  exited africa and crossed the atlantic without developing on july25 it entered the eastern pacific gradually developing an area of organized convection despite marginally favorable upper-level winds the system organized enough to be declared a tropical depression on august1 several hundred miles southwest of  initially the depression tracked west-northwestward despite wind shear in the area the depression was upgraded to tropical storm gilma later on august1 the wind shear prevented further strengthening or organization and gilma weakened to a tropical depression early on august2 the depression turned westward and gilma degenerated into a remnant low by august4 
hurricane hector 

a tropical wave exited africa on july31 and after no development in the atlantic it crossed central america into the northeastern pacific ocean on august10 convection gradually increased and a broad  developed about 375miles  605km  south of  on august13 the system continued to become organized and it developed into a  around 1800 on august15 about 650mi  1,045km  south-southwest of the southern tip of  it moved west-northwestward located south of a  that extended westward from northern mexico westward into the pacific the depression quickly intensified into tropical storm hector early on august16 hector was able to steadily strengthen reaching hurricane status at 0600utc on august17 it is estimated that hector reached its peak intensity of 110mph  175km h  at 0600utc on august18 while centered about 1,035mi  1,665km  southwest of the southern tip of baja california hector remained a  for about 24hours shortly thereafter it encountered cooler waters and westerly shear and hector steadily weakened until becoming a tropical storm by august20 shortly thereafter the storm reached a weakness in the  which caused it to move slowly to the northwest by august21 deep convection was confined to the northeast portion of the circulation the shear was not strong enough to completely weaken the tropical cyclone and hector remained a tropical storm with 50mph  85km h  winds for about 24hours after the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity dissipated on august22 the cyclone turned westward in response to the low-level easterly wind flow hector weakened to a tropical depression at 0000utc on august23 and to a  sixhours later the remnant circulation of hector dissipated on august24 about 750mi  1,210km  east of the  
hurricane ioke 

main article  
the cyclone developed from the  on august20 far to the south of  encountering warm waters little  and well-defined  ioke intensified from a tropical depression to  status within 48hours late on august22 it rapidly weakened to category2 status before crossing over  two days later favorable conditions again allowed for  and ioke attained category5 status on august 25before crossing the international date line at the time its  was estimated at 915 thus becoming the strongest hurricane on record in the central pacific as it continued westward its intensity fluctuated and on august31 it passed near  with winds of 155mph  249km h  ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward and by september6 it had transitioned into an  by then the cyclone had lasted 19days reaching the equivalent of  status on the  three times the remnants of ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into  ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the central pacific or western pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon a crew of 12people stayed in a hurricane-proof bunker on  during the hurricane s passage  the crew estimated winds reached over 100mph  160km h  which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the island s bird population the hurricane left moderate damage on  totaling  88million  2006usd  which resulted from blown off roofs and damaged buildings although the infrastructure of the island was left intact all military personnel were evacuated from the island the first full-scale evacuation of the island since typhoon sarah in  later the extratropical remnants of ioke produced a severe storm surge along the  coastline causing beach erosion 
hurricane ileana 

main article  
the origins of hurricane ileana were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of africa on august8 it entered the eastern north pacific on august16 and developed into a tropical depression on august21 near  the depression strengthened into tropical storm ileana six hours after forming ileana continued to strengthen becoming a hurricane in 24hours and a major hurricane a day after that ileana reached its peak intensity of 120mph  195km h  before beginning a slow weakening phase on august24 when it encountered cooler waters ileana weakened a tropical depression on the morning of august27 and quickly degenerated into a remnant low dissipating on august29 as ileana was heading north along the mexican coastline slight rainfall was recorded along the coast there were also reports of hurricane-force winds on  one fatality was reported when a man drowned in heavy surf near  
hurricane john 

main article  
on august28 a persistent area of low pressure southwest of  mexico developed into a tropical depression later that day it strengthened into a tropical storm and it reached hurricane strength 24hours later on august29 john underwent rapid intensification and reached category3 intensity later that day and category4 on august30 hours later the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle and subsequently weakened to category3 status as it paralleled the mexican coastline a short distance offshore potentially due to its eyewall replacement cycle or its interaction with land hurricane john weakened to a 105mph hurricane by late on august31 but restrengthened to a major hurricane shortly after it made landfall near the southern tip of the  as a category2 hurricane on september1 john continued northwestward along the eastern baja california peninsula weakening to tropical depression status by september3 and dissipating on september4 in the  along the southwestern coast of mexico hurricane john produced heavy surf strong winds and heavy rainfall which flooded roads caused mudslides and downed trees along the baja california peninsula the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall with a 24-hour peak of 10.8inches  276mm  in los planes the heavy rainfall caused flooding closed roads and caused a dam to overflow the winds and rainfall destroyed thousands of flimsy houses across the region across mexico five people were killed and damage amounted to  663million  2006  60.8million 2006  moisture from the remnants of john produced flooding across texas which closed a mile  800m  portion of  in el paso in southern new mexico the rainfall caused widespread street flooding and some minor damage tropical moisture from the storm also produced rainfall in  and southern  where eight separate mudslides occurred trapping 19vehicles but causing no injuries 
hurricane kristy 
main article  

on august30 a tropical wave located about 525miles  850km  south-southwest of  became more organized and was designated as the twelfth tropical depression of the 2006season it strengthened into tropical storm kristy and became hurricane kristy the next day it did not retain this status for long partly due to its proximity to hurricane john there was a possibility of a  between both systems causing kristy to weaken or perhaps be absorbed into the circulation of john this did not occur however kristy weakened steadily after its peak intensity and looked to be close to dissipating but on september3 and again on september5 convection flared up and it returned to tropical storm strength after oscillating between storm and depression strength the system degenerated into a remnant low on september7 which dissipated on september8 without affecting land 
hurricane lane 

main article  
on september13 a tropical disturbance located about 125miles  200km  west-southwest of  mexico gradually became better organized and was designated the thirteenth tropical depression of the 2006season the depression intensified in a favorable environment and was upgraded to tropical storm lane later that night as it moved parallel to the mexican coast it continued to strengthen and became a hurricane on september15 and a major hurricane early the next day hurricane lane reached peak winds of 125mph  205km h  before it made landfall on the coast of  on september16 it quickly weakened over land and dissipated on september17 tropical storm lane produced heavy rainfall and high seas along the west coast of mexico including  where flood waters reached 16inches  40cm  in depth the acapulco airport also experienced flooding though service was not interrupted throughout mexico the hurricane caused four deaths and  2.2billion  2006mxn  203million 2006usd  in damage half of which in  where heavy crop damage was reported an estimated 4,320homes were affected by the hurricane and 19,200miles  30,000km  of roads and highways were damaged to some degree including some destroyed bridges 
tropical storm miriam 

a disturbance associated with a northerly extension of the  and a tropical wave developed a closed circulation on september15 it moved northeastward due to the influence from nearby hurricane lane and organized enough to be declared tropical depression fourteen-e on september16 while located about 500miles southwest of  mexico it quickly strengthened and organized into tropical storm miriam later that day after reaching a peak intensity of 45mph  70km h  vertical wind shear and cooler waters rapidly weakened the storm and the circulation decoupled from the convection on september17 after turning more towards the north miriam weakened to tropical depression status and on september18 it degenerated to a remnant low the remnant circulation turned to the northwest then to the east and dissipated on september21 a short distance west of  no deaths are damage are associated with miriam and only one ship recorded winds of over tropical storm force near the center 
tropical depression two-c 

on september19 an area of disturbed weather associated with the  became sufficiently organized to be designated tropical depression two-c initially it was thought that the depression formed from the remnants of  although subsequent analysis confirmed they were two separate systems initially the depression was in an area of favorable conditions with little wind shear and warm waters as a result the cphc predicted significant strengthening to at least hurricane status instead a high pressure system to its north increased wind shear over the depression causing the convection to become removed from the center the depression weakened into a remnant low on september20 never reaching tropical storm status 
tropical depression three-c 

during september  conditions became established across the pacific which produced an area of warmer waters along the international date line a few days after tropical depression two-c dissipated another area of disturbed weather formed and although it was disorganized it was also persistent the cphc initiated advisories on tropical depression three-c on september26 after a circulation was evident in the system strong wind shear prevented any development and the system dissipated on september27 
tropical storm norman 

main article  
early in october a low pressure system began to organize to the west of the mexican coast and on october9 it developed into tropical depression fifteen-e it strengthened into a tropical storm the next day but strong wind shear and low sea-surface temperatures hindered development norman slowly began to weaken and on october11 it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area turning eastward the system combined with a new tropical disturbance off the southwest mexican coast and slowly began to reorganize the system was re-designated a tropical depression on october15 just south-southeast of  although within a few hours it again dissipated the storm brought heavy rainfall to southwestern mexico peaking at 6.35inches  161mm  in  the rainfall caused flooding and mudslides around acapulco affecting 170homes of which 20 were destroyed about 300hectares  740acres  of crop fields sustained damage initially there were two people missing  however a subsequent report indicated there were no casualties associated with the storm 
tropical storm olivia 

on september18 a  exited  and later crossed into the eastern  on september29 without development convection increased in the pacific along the wave axis spawning a broad  on october5 despite the presence of  it organized enough for the nhc to initiate advisories on tropical depression sixteen-e on october9 about 1,360 miles  2,190km  to the west-southwest of the southern tip of  influenced by a  the depression drifted northward six hours after being upgraded to a tropical storm olivia attained peak winds of 45mph  75km h  although the convection was limited to its northern side due to wind shear on october 11 the convective activity diminished and olivia weakened to tropical depression status olivia deteriorated into a remnant low on october13 it moved towards the east-southeast and on october15 was absorbed into the remnants of  olivia never affected land 
tropical depression four-c 

in the middle of october the intertropical convergence zone extended across the central pacific ocean resembling an extension of the  an area of disturbed weather formed well to the southwest of hawaii organizing slowly for several days late on october13 after the development of a low-level circulation and persistent convection the cphc classified the system as tropical depression four-c about 750mi  1,200km  southwest of  upon being classified the depression was located in an unusual  that caused it to track eastward due to the approach of an upper-level  it was expected to dissipate quickly from  although forecasters noted the possibility for the trough to provide an  channel which might allow strengthening on october14 strong wind shear removed the convection completely from the center and the system degenerated into a remnant low the remnant circulation continued slowly eastward dissipating on october16 concurrently the convection tracked northeastward ahead of the upper-level trough which contributed to heavy rainfall and flooding on the island of  on october17 the rainfall event coincided with an  striking the area 
hurricane paul 

main article  
hurricane paul developed from an area of disturbed weather on october21 and slowly intensified as it moved into an area of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear paul attained hurricane status on october23 and later that day it reached its peak intensity of 105mph  165km h  a strong category2 hurricane on the  a strong trough turned the hurricane to the north and northeast into an area of strong vertical shear and paul weakened to a tropical storm on october24 later passing just south of the baja california peninsula paul weakened to a tropical depression on october25 a short distance off the coast of  and after briefly turning away from the coast it made landfall on northwestern  on october26 paul was the third hurricane to threaten western mexico in the season the others being  and  rough surf killed two people along  while two deaths from flooding were reported in  paul dropped moderate rainfall across mainland mexico including a 24-hour total of 2.28inches  58mm  in   damage totaled more than  35million  2006  3.2million 2006  
tropical depression eighteen-e 

the origins of tropical depression eighteen-e were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of africa on october7 it briefly spawned a low-pressure area as the wave continued westward without development on october20 the wave entered the pacific ocean developing an area of thunderstorms about four days later by 1200utc on october26 a tropical depression formed about 155mi  260km  south of manzanillo initially tropical depression eighteen-e was located in an area of light wind shear and the nhc anticipated further organization and strengthening to near hurricane status the tropical depression initially maintained a steady westward motion away from the mexican coastline due to a ridge north of the cyclone by october17 convection had decreased and the depression was not forecast to intensify as much possibly due to intrusion of dry air the circulation became exposed from the thunderstorms and having weakened it turned to a southward drift by 0000utc on october28 the system had weakened to a non-convective remnant low which dissipated the following day 
tropical storm rosa 

a tropical wave exited western africa on october22 and continued westward into the pacific on november2 spawning a tropical depression on november8 about 440mi  710km  south of  environmental conditions appeared favorable although wind shear removed the convection from the circulation throughout its duration the storm maintained a northwest track through a weakness in a  by november9 a new area of convection persisted near the center and a  formed despite the shear the depression was upgraded to tropical storm rosa although the shear prevented intensification beyond its peak of 40mph  65km h  rosa remained a tropical storm for only 18hours becoming a tropical depression early on november10 and dissipating later that day rosa was the first tropical storm in the basin to develop during november since 2000 and was also the first tropical depression to form in the month since 2002 s  no impact was reported from the storm 
tropical depression twenty-e 

a tropical wave moved off the western coast of africa on october21 briefly developing two weak low pressure areas before the wave crossed into the pacific ocean on november1 thunderstorm activity slowly increased as the wave interacted within the intertropical convergence zone after a curved band of convection developed it is estimated the system formed into tropical depression twenty-e around 0000utc on november11 about 550mi  1,050km  southwest of manzanillo throughout its duration the depression never completely separated from the intertropical convergence zone when the nhc issued its first advisory on the depression the agency predicted slight intensification to tropical storm status and for the depression to last at least two days this was due to a forecast of gradually increasing wind shear after the first 24hours instead the circulation became very elongated  it is estimated the cyclone degenerated into a trough by late on november11 
hurricane sergio 

main article  
just days after tropical depression twenty-e degenerated into an open trough tropical depression twenty one-e developed from a  on november13 about 460miles  740km  south of  it steadily intensified as it tracked southeastward reaching peak winds of 110mph  175km h  on november15 subsequently it began to weaken due to increased  as it turned to the north sergio later turned to the west remaining well off the coast of  and it dissipated on november20 about 320miles  515km  west-northwest of where it originally formed sergio produced light rainfall along the coast of mexico though its effects were minimal the formation of sergio marked the 2006 season as the most active in 12years and the second season in which more than one tropical storm formed in november after  sergio set records for the month of november in the basin at the time it was considered the strongest hurricane to form in the month  although it has since dropped to third after  and  it is however still considered the longest-lived november  with a duration of seven days

the cyclone at peak intensity in the northeast pacific on november 1 

main article  
on october 28 2006 a cut-off extratropical cyclone stalled over the northeast pacific ocean and began to strengthen by october 31 the storm had acquired tropical characteristics including an  convection and a warmer-than-average core the system reached peak intensity on november 1 before slowly weakening and looping towards the  the system made landfall in  on november 3 before rapidly weakening and dissipating on the next day during the duration of the storm the system was known as storm 91c  or invest 91c  the storm s true nature still remains controversial among meteorologists today due to disputes over the storm s exact structure and whether or not it had obtained tropical or subtropical characteristics because the storm was not within the area of responsibility of the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane center the storm was never assigned a name 
storm names 
the following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast pacific in 2006 this is the same list that was used in the  there were no names retired from the northeast pacific list therefore the same list was reused in the  
for storms that form in the  s area of responsibility encompassing the area between  and the  all names are used in a series of  the next four names that were slated for use in 2006 are shown below however only the name  was used 
retirement 
the name ioke was  from the north-central pacific list by the  in the spring of 2007 and replaced with iopa during the 61st interdepartmental hurricane conference the hawaii state civil defense requested the retirement of the name daniel citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat of damage however the request was denied as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list season effects 
this is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2006 pacific hurricane season it includes their duration names landfall s  denoted in parentheses damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect  an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident  but were still related to that storm damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical a wave or a low and all the damage figures are in 2006 usd
