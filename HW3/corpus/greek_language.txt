in the modern era the greek language entered a state of   the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language what came to be known as the  was a polarization between two competing varieties of    the vernacular form of modern greek proper and  meaning  purified  a compromise between dimotiki and  which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed greek state in 1976 dimotiki was declared the official language of greece having incorporated features of katharevousa and giving birth to  which is used today for all official purposes and in education historical unity 




the distribution of major modern greek dialect areas 

the historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the greek language is often emphasised although greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages never since classical antiquity has its cultural literary and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language it is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages according to one estimation  homeric greek is probably closer to demotic than 12-century middle english is to modern spoken english

spread of greek in the united states 

greek is spoken by about 13 million people mainly in   and  but also worldwide by the large  there are traditional greek-speaking settlements and regions in the neighbouring countries of   and  as well as in several countries in the  area such as      and  and around the        and ancient coastal towns along the  the language is also spoken by greek emigrant communities in many countries in  especially the united kingdom and germany canada the united states      and others official status 
greek is the  of greece where it is spoken by almost the entire population it is also the official language of cyprus  nominally alongside   because of the membership of greece and cyprus in the european union greek is one of the organization s  furthermore greek is officially recognised as a  in parts of  and official in  and    and as a minority language all over  as well as in     and  as a regional or minority language in the framework of the  greeks are also a  in  characteristics

the    and  of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period the division into conventional periods is as with all such periodisations relatively arbitrary especially because at all periods ancient greek has enjoyed high prestige and the literate borrowed heavily from it phonology 
see also  
across its history the syllabic structure of greek has varied little  greek shows a mixed syllable structure permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas it has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts the main phonological changes occurred during the hellenistic and roman period  see  for details 

replacement of the  with a  simplification of the system of  and   loss of vowel length distinction monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a  of vowels towards  i    development of the     p  and  t  to the voiceless   f  and   respectively  the similar development of  k  to  x  may have taken place later  the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography and both earlier and later phonemes are written with   and   development of the  plosives  b   d  and   to their voiced fricative counterparts    later  v    and   
morphology 
in all its stages the morphology of greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes a limited but productive system of compounding and a rich inflectional system although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time morphological changes are present throughout particularly in the nominal and verbal systems the major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case  its functions being largely taken over by the genitive  the verbal system has lost the infinitive the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood many have been replaced by   analytical  forms nouns and adjectives 
pronouns show distinctions in   1st 2nd and 3rd    singular dual and plural in the ancient language  singular and plural alone in later stages  and   masculine feminine and neuter  and decline for   from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language  nouns articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun verbs 
the inflectional categories of the greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language s history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression greek verbs have  inflectional forms for 

syntax 
many aspects of the  of greek have remained constant  verbs agree with their subject only the use of the surviving cases is largely intact  nominative for subjects and predicates accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions genitive for possessors  articles precede nouns adpositions are largely prepositional relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial however the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the  ancient greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely  instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions  and uses participles more restrictively the loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects  and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well  ancient greek tended to be verb-final but neutral word order in the modern language is vso or svo vocabulary 
greek is a language distinguished by an extensive  most of the vocabulary of ancient greek was inherited but it includes a number of  from the languages of the populations that inhabited greece before the arrival of proto-greeks words of non-indo-european origin can be traced into greek from as early as mycenaean times  they include a large number of greek  the vast majority of modern greek vocabulary is directly inherited from ancient greek but in some cases words have changed meanings   words of foreign origin  have entered the language mainly from   and  during the older periods of greek loanwords into greek acquired greek inflections thus leaving only a foreign root word modern borrowings  from the 20th century on  especially from  and  are typically not inflected greek loanwords in other languages 
for more details on this topic see  greek words have been widely borrowed into other languages including english            etc moreover greek words and  continue to be productive as a basis for coinages        etc and form with  the  like all words ending with logy  discourse  there are many  classification 
greek is an independent branch of the   the ancient language most closely related to it may be  which many scholars suggest may have been a  of greek itself but it is so poorly attested that it is difficult to conclude anything about it independently of the macedonian question some scholars have grouped greek into  as greek and the extinct  share features that are not found in other indo-european languages among living languages some indo-europeanists suggest that greek may be most closely related to   see   or the   see   but little definitive evidence has been found for grouping the living branches of the family in addition  has also been considered somewhat related to greek and  by some linguists if proven and recognised the three languages would form a new balkan sub-branch with other dead european languages writing system
