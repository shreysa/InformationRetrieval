multiprogramming stretch feasibility considerations the tendency towards increased parallelism in computers is noted exploitation of this parallelism presents a number of new problems in machine design and in programming systems minimum requirements for successful concurrent execution of several independent problem programs are discussed these requirements are met in the stretch system by a carefully balanced combination of built-in and programmed logic techniques are described which place the burden of the programmed logic on system programs supervisory program and compiler rather than on problem programs cacm November, 1959 Codd, E.
