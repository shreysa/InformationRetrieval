the assembly of the international space station a major endeavour in  began in november 1998 russian modules launched and docked robotically with the exception of  all other modules were delivered by the space shuttle which required installation by iss and shuttle crewmembers using the   ssrms  and   evas  as of 5 june 2011 they had added 159 components during more than 1,000 hours of eva  see   127 of these spacewalks originated from the station and the remaining 32 were launched from the airlocks of docked space shuttles the  of the station had to be considered at all times during construction as it directly affects how long during its orbit the station  and any docked or docking spacecraft  is exposed to the sun  the space shuttle would not perform optimally above a limit called the  beta cutoff  many of the modules that launched on the space shuttle were  at the  to find and correct issues prior to launch the first module of the iss  was launched on 20 november 1998 on an autonomous russian  it provided propulsion  communications electrical power but lacked long-term life support functions two weeks later a passive nasa module  was launched aboard space shuttle flight  and attached to zarya by astronauts during evas this module has two   pmas  one connects permanently to zarya the other allows the space shuttle to dock to the space station at that time the russian station mir was still inhabited the iss remained unmanned for two years while mir was de-orbited on 12 july 2000  was launched into orbit preprogrammed commands on board deployed its solar arrays and communications antenna it then became the passive target for a rendezvous with zarya and unity  it maintained a station-keeping orbit while the zarya-unity vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the russian automated rendezvous and docking system zarya s computer transferred control of the station to zvezda s computer soon after docking zvezda added sleeping quarters a toilet kitchen co2 scrubbers dehumidifier oxygen generators exercise equipment plus data voice and television communications with mission control this enabled permanent habitation of the station the first resident crew  arrived in november 2000 on  at the end of the first day on the station astronaut bill shepherd requested the use of the radio call sign  alpha  which he and cosmonaut krikalev preferred to the more cumbersome  international space station  the name  alpha  had previously been used for the station in the early 1990s and following the request its use was authorised for the whole of expedition 1 shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time referencing a  in a pre-launch news conference he had said   for thousands of years humans have been going to sea in ships people have designed and built these vessels launched them with a good feeling that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage   the president of  at the time disapproved of the name  alpha  he felt that mir was the first space station and so he would have preferred the names  beta  or  mir2  for the iss  arrived midway between the

orbital boosting can be performed by the station s two main engines on the  service module or russian or european spacecraft docked to zvezda s aft port the atv has been designed with the possibility of adding a  to its other end allowing it to remain at the iss and still allow other craft to dock and boost the station it takes approximately two orbits  three hours  for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed maintaining iss altitude uses about 7.5 tonnes of chemical fuel per annum at an annual cost of about  210 million in december 2008 nasa signed an agreement with the  which may result in the testing on the iss of a  plasma propulsion engine this technology could allow  to be done more economically than at present the russian orbital segment contains the data management system which handles guidance navigation and control  ros gnc  for the entire station initially zarya the first module of the station controlled the station until a short time after the russian service module zvezda docked and was transferred control zvezda contains the esa built dms-r data management system using two fault-tolerant computers  ftc  zvezda computes the station s position and orbital trajectory using redundant earth horizon sensors solar horizon sensors as well as sun and star trackers the ftcs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting orientation
zvezda uses gyroscopes and thrusters to turn itself around gyroscopes do not require propellant rather they use electricity to  store  momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the station s movement the usos has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section when gyroscopes  thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum during  an incorrect command was sent to the station s computer using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed when attitude control computers in the ros and usos fail to communicate properly it can result in a rare  force fight  where the ros gnc computer must ignore the usos counterpart which has no thrusters when an atv nasa shuttle or soyuz is docked to the station it can also be used to maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting shuttle control was used exclusively during  of the s3 s4 truss which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station s electronics mission controls

the  resupply vehicle as it approaches the iss in 2012 over 50 unpiloted  spacecraft have been sent with supplies during the lifetime of the station 

all russian spacecraft and self-propelled modules are able to rendezvous and dock to the space station without human intervention using the  docking system radar allows these vehicles to detect and intercept iss from over 200 kilometres away the european atv uses star sensors and gps to determine its intercept course when it catches up it uses laser equipment to  recognise zvezda along with the kurs system for redundancy crew supervise these craft but do not intervene except to send abort commands in emergencies the japanese  parks itself in progressively closer orbits to the station and then awaits  approach  commands from the crew until it is close enough for a robotic arm to grapple and berth the vehicle to the usos the american space shuttle was manually docked and on missions with a  the container would be berthed to the station with the use of manual robotic arms berthed craft can transfer  japanese spacecraft berth for one to two months russian and european supply craft can remain at the iss for six months allowing great flexibility in crew time for loading and unloading of supplies and trash nasa shuttles could remain docked for 1112 days 



    and  docked to the iss as seen from the departing 


the american manual approach to docking allows greater initial flexibility and less complexity the downside to this mode of operation is that each mission becomes unique and requires specialised training and planning making the process more labour-intensive and expensive the russians pursued an automated methodology that used the crew in override or monitoring roles although the initial development costs were high the system has become very reliable with standardisations that provide significant cost benefits in repetitive routine operations an automated approach could allow assembly of modules orbiting other worlds prior to crew arrival soyuz spacecraft used for crew rotation also serve as lifeboats for emergency evacuation  they are replaced every six months and have been used once to remove excess crew after the  expeditions require on average 2,722kg of supplies and as of 9 march 2011 crews had consumed a total of around 22,000 meals soyuz crew rotation flights and progress resupply flights visit the station on average two and three times respectively each year with the atv and htv planned to visit annually from 2010 onwards   and  were contracted to fly cargo to the station after retirement of the nasa shuttle from 26 february 2011 to 7 march 2011 four of the governmental partners  united states esa japan and russia  had their spacecraft  nasa shuttle atv htv progress and soyuz  docked at the iss the only time this has happened to date on 25 may 2012  became the world s first privately held company to send cargo via the  to the international space station launch and docking windows
prior to a ship s docking to the iss navigation and attitude control  gnc  is handed over to the ground control of the ships  country of origin gnc is set to allow the station to drift in space rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes the solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming ships so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells when a nasa  docked to the station other ships were grounded as the shuttle s  wing leading edges cameras windows and instruments were too much at risk from damage or contamination by thruster residue from other ships  movements approximately 30 of nasa shuttle launch delays were caused by poor weather occasional priority was given to the soyuz arrivals at the station where the soyuz carried crew with time-critical cargoes such as biological experiment materials also causing shuttle delays departure of the nasa shuttle was often delayed or prioritised according to weather over its two landing sites whilst the soyuz is capable of landing anywhere anytime its planned landing time and place is chosen to give consideration to helicopter pilots and ground recovery crew to give acceptable flying weather and lighting conditions soyuz launches occur in adverse weather conditions but the cosmodrome has been shut down on occasions when buried by snow drifts up to 6 metres in depth hampering ground operations life aboard
crew activities




crewmember peers out of a window


a typical day for the crew begins with a wake-up at 06 00 followed by post-sleep activities and a morning inspection of the station the crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with mission control before starting work at around 08 10 the first scheduled exercise of the day follows after which the crew continues work until 13 05 following a one-hour lunch break the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its pre-sleep activities beginning at 19 30 including dinner and a crew conference the scheduled sleep period begins at 21 30 in general the crew works ten hours per day on a weekday and five hours on saturdays with the rest of the time their own for relaxation or work catch-up the time zone used aboard the iss is   utc  the windows are covered at night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets per day during visiting space shuttle missions the iss crew mostly follows the shuttle s   met  which is a flexible time zone based on the launch time of the shuttle mission the station provides crew quarters for each member of the expedition s crew with two  sleep stations  in the zvezda and four more installed in harmony the american quarters are private approximately person-sized soundproof booths the russian crew quarters include a small window but provide less ventilation and sound proofing a crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag listen to music use a laptop and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module s walls the module also provides a reading lamp a shelf and a desktop visiting crews have no allocated sleep module and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall it is possible to sleep floating freely through the station but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment it is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated  otherwise astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads see also

the iss is partially protected from the space environment by earth s  from an average distance of about 70,000km  43,000mi  depending on solar activity the  begins to deflect  around earth and iss  are still a hazard to the crew who may receive only a few minutes warning in 2005 during the initial  proton storm  of an x-3 class solar flare the crew of  took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the  designed for this purpose

subatomic charged particles primarily  from  and solar wind are normally absorbed by earth s atmosphere when they interact in sufficient quantity their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an  outside earth s atmosphere crews are exposed to about 1  each day which is about a year of natural exposure on earth this results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the  and  of  these cells are central to the  and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower  experienced by astronauts radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of  in astronauts protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level radiation levels on the iss are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew earth s electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low earth orbit as in the stratosphere for example on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day  only 1 5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in leo additionally airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight while iss crew are exposed for their whole stay see also   and 
stress




cosmonaut  at work inside  service module crew quarters


there is considerable evidence that  stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance cosmonaut  wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board the  space station   all the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 and leave them together for two months 
nasa s interest in  caused by space travel initially studied when their manned missions began was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the russian space station mir common sources of stress in early american missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family the latter is still often a cause of stress on the iss such as when the mother of nasa astronaut  died in a car accident and when michael fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child a study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment skylab s three crews remained one two and three months respectively long term crews on salyut6  and the iss last about five to six months and mir s expeditions often lasted longer the iss working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language first-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language  second and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages the iss is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into  host  or  guest  categories as with previous stations and spacecraft and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way crew members with a military pilot background and those with an academic science background or teachers and politicians may have problems understanding each other s jargon and worldview medical

medical effects of long-term weightlessness include  deterioration of the skeleton  fluid redistribution a slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system lesser symptoms include loss of body mass and puffiness of the face sleep is disturbed on the iss regularly because of mission demands such as incoming or departing ships sound levels in the station are unavoidably high  because the atmosphere is unable to  fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere which would stagnate in the freefall  zero-g  environment to prevent some of these adverse  effects the station is equipped with two treadmills  including the   and the ared  advanced resistive exercise device  which enables various weightlifting exercises which add muscle but do not compensate for or raise astronauts  reduced bone density and a stationary bicycle  each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill microbiological environmental hazards

trackable objects including debris with distinct ring of  satellites




at the low altitudes at which the iss orbits there is a variety of space debris consisting of different objects including entire spent rocket stages defunct satellites explosion fragmentsincluding materials from  tests paint flakes slag from solid rocket motors and coolant released by  nuclear-powered satellites these objects in addition to natural  are a significant threat large objects could destroy the station but are less of a threat because their orbits can be predicted objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments from approximately 1cm down to microscopic size number in the trillions despite their small size some of these objects are a threat because of their  and direction in relation to the station spacesuits of spacewalking crew could puncture causing  ballistic panels also called micrometeorite shielding are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems the type and thickness of these panels depends on their predicted exposure to damage the station s shields and structure have different designs on the ros and the usos on the usos a thin aluminium sheet is held apart from the hull and causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull thereby spreading the energy of impact on the ros a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering and glass cloth over the top it is about 50 less likely to be punctured and crew move to the ros when the station is under threat punctures on the ros would be contained within the panels which are 70cm square

space debris is tracked remotely from the ground and the station crew can be notified this allows for a   dam  to be conducted which uses thrusters on the russian orbital segment to alter the station s orbital altitude avoiding the debris dams are not uncommon taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance eight dams had been performed prior to march 2009 the first seven between october 1999 and may 2003 usually the orbit is raised by one or two kilometres by means of an increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1m s unusually there was a lowering of 1.7km on 27 august 2008 the first such lowering for 8 years there were two dams in 2009 on 22 march and 17 july if a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a dam to be safely conducted the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their  so that they would be able to evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris this partial station evacuation has occurred on 13 march 2009 28 june 2011 24 march 2012 and 16 june 2015 end of mission




many iss resupply spacecraft have already undergone  such as 


according to a 2009 report  is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the russian orbital segment when the end of mission is reached and use them as a basis for a new station called the   opsek  the modules under consideration for removal from the current iss include the   nauka  currently scheduled to be launched in 2017 and other russian modules which are planned to be attached to nauka afterwards those modules would be within their useful lives in 2016 or 2020 the report presents a statement from an unnamed russian engineer that based on the experience from mir a 30-year life should be possible except for micrometeorite damage because the russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind according to the  the united states and russia are legally responsible for all modules they have launched in iss planning nasa examined options including returning the station to earth via shuttle missions  deemed too expensive as the usos is not designed for disassembly and this would require at least 27 shuttle missions  natural orbital decay with random reentry similar to  boosting the station to a higher altitude  which would delay reentry  and a controlled targeted de-orbit to a remote ocean area a controlled deorbit into a remote ocean was found to be technically feasible only with russia s assistance the russian space agency has experience from de-orbiting the     and  space stations  nasa s first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite  the   occurred in 2000 as of late 2010 the preferred plan is to use a slightly modified progress spacecraft to de-orbit the iss this plan was seen as the simplest cheapest and with the highest margin  the only space station built and launched entirely by the us decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years and no attempt was made to de-orbit it using a  remains of skylab hit populated areas of  without injuries or loss of life the  a discussion by nasa and boeing at the end of 2011 suggested using leftover usos hardware and   2     as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the earth-moon  l1 or l2 the entire usos cannot be reused and will be discarded but some russian modules are planned to be reused  the  two science power platforms and rassvet launched between 2010 and 2015 and joined to the ros may be separated to form  nauka will be used in the station whose main goal is supporting manned deep space exploration opsek will orbit at a higher inclination of 71 degrees allowing observation to and from all of the russian federation in february 2015 roscosmos announced that it would remain a part of the iss programme until 2024 nine months earlierin response to us sanctions against russia over the russian deputy prime minister  had stated that russia would reject a us request to prolong the orbiting station s use beyond 2020 and would only supply rocket engines to the us for non-military satellite launches a proposed modification that would reuse some of the iss american and european segments is to attach a  drive module to the vacated node with its own onboard power source this would allow long-term reliability testing of the concept for less cost than building a dedicated space station from scratch on 28 march 2015 russian sources announced that roscosmos and nasa had agreed to collaborate on the development of a replacement for the current iss  the head of russia s roscosmos made the announcement with nasa administrator charles bolden at his side komarov said  roscosmos together with nasa will work on the programme of a future orbital station   we agreed that the group of countries taking part in the iss project will work on the future project of a new orbital station   the first step is that the iss will operate until 2024  and that roscosmos and nasa  do not rule out that the station s flight could be extended  in a statement provided to spacenews on 28 march nasa spokesman david weaver said the agency appreciated the russian commitment to extending the iss but did not confirm any plans for a future space station on 30 september 2015 boeing s contract with nasa as prime contractor for the iss was extended to 30 september 2020 part of boeing s services under the contract will relate to extending the station s primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028 regarding extending the iss on 15 november 2016 general director vladimir solntsev of rsc energia stated  maybe the iss will receive continued resources today we discussed the possibility of using the station until 2028  and  much will depend on the political moments in relations with the americans with the new administration it will be discussed 
cost
the iss has been described as the most expensive single item ever constructed in 2010 the cost was expected to be  150billion this includes nasa s budget of  58.7billion  inflation-unadjusted  for the station from 1985 to 2015  72.4billion in 2010 dollars  russia s  12billion europe s  5billion japan s  5billion canada s  2billion and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station  estimated at  1.4billion each or  50.4billion in total assuming 20,000 person-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two to six-person crews each person-day would cost  7.5million less than half the inflation-adjusted  19.6million  5.5million before inflation  per person-day of skylab international co-operation

naked eye
the iss is visible to the  as a slow-moving bright white dot because of reflected sunlight and can be seen in the hours after sunset and before sunrise when the station remains sunlit but the ground and sky are dark the iss takes about 10 minutes to pass from one horizon to another and will only be visible part of that time because of moving into or out of the  because of the size of its reflective surface area the iss is the brightest artificial object in the sky excluding  with an approximate maximum  of 4 when overhead  similar to venus  the iss like many satellites including the  can also produce flares of up to 8 or 16 times the brightness of  as sunlight glints off reflective surfaces the iss is also visible during broad daylight conditions albeit with a great deal more effort tools are provided by a number of websites such as   see  below  as well as  applications that use the known  and the observer s longitude and latitude to predict when the iss will be visible  weather permitting  where the station will appear to rise to the observer the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears to the observer either by setting below the horizon or entering into earth s shadow in november 2012 nasa launched its  spot the station  service which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town the station is visible from 95 of the inhabited land on earth but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes astrophotography
using a telescope-mounted camera to photograph the station is a popular hobby for astronomers whilst using a mounted camera to photograph the earth and stars is a popular hobby for crew the use of a telescope or binoculars allows viewing of the iss during daylight hours parisian engineer and astrophotographer thierry legault known for his photos of spaceships crossing the sun  called   travelled to oman in 2011 to photograph the sun moon and space station all lined up legault who received the marius jacquemetton award from the  in 1999 and other hobbyists use websites that predict when the iss will pass in front of the sun or moon and from what location those passes will be visible see also
