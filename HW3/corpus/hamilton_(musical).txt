while on vacation from performing in his hit  show  lin-manuel miranda bought a copy of alexander hamilton by  a biography of  at an airport after finishing the first few chapters miranda began to envision the life of hamilton as a musical and researched whether a stage musical of hamilton s life had been created all he found was that a  had been done on broadway in 1917 starring  as alexander hamilton miranda therefore began a project entitled the hamilton mixtape on may 12 2009 miranda was invited to perform music from  at the  evening of poetry music and the spoken word instead he performed the first song from the hamilton mixtape a rough version of what would later become  alexander hamilton  hamilton s opening number he spent a year after that working on  my shot  another early number from the show miranda performed in a workshop production of the show then titled the hamilton mixtape at the   on july 27 2013 the workshop production was directed by  and musically directed by  the workshop consisted of the entirety of the first act of the show and three songs from the second act the workshop was accompanied by lacamoire on the piano of the original workshop cast only three principal cast members played in the off-broadway production  miranda  and  most of the original off-broadway cast moved to broadway except  who was replaced by  as king george iii productions

the angelica tour alone requires 14 truckloads of cargo and a core group of over 60 traveling cast crew and musicians the production team insisted that each tour must be able to duplicate the original broadway show s choreography which literally revolves around two concentric turntables on the stage this led to the construction of four portable sets two for each tour so that one set can be assembled well in advance at the next stop while the tour is still playing at the last stop west end  2017

marilyn stasio in her review of the off-broadway production for  wrote  the music is exhilarating but the lyrics are the big surprise the sense as well as the sound of the sung dialogue has been purposely suited to each character george washington a stately figure in jackson s dignified performance sings in polished prose but in the end miranda s impassioned narrative of one man s story becomes the collective narrative of a nation a nation built by immigrants who occasionally need to be reminded where they came from 




the hamilton cast and crew greets president  on july 18 2015 

in his review of the off-broadway production jesse green in  wrote  the conflict between independence and interdependence is not just the show s subject but also its method  it brings the complexity of forming a union from disparate constituencies right to your ears few are the theatergoers who will be familiar with all of miranda s touchstones i caught the verbal references to     and  but other people had to point out to me the frequent hat-tips to hip-hop whether it s a watershed a breakthrough and a game changer as some have been saying is another matter miranda is too savvy  and loves his antecedents too much  to try to reinvent all the rules at once those duels by the waythere are three of themare superbly handled the highlights of a riveting if at times overbusy staging by the director thomas kail and the choreographer andy blankenbuehler  although giving a positive review elisabeth vincentelli of   which was founded by hamilton himself  wrote that hamilton and burr s love hate relationship  fails to drive the showpartly because miranda lacks the charisma and intensity of the man he portrays  and that  too many of the numbers are exposition-heavy lessons as if this were  schoolhouse rap  the show is burdened with eye-glazingly dull stretches especially those involving george washington 
 in reviewing the broadway production in  wrote  i am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit broadway show but hamilton directed by thomas kail and starring mr miranda might just about be worth it washington jefferson madisonthey re all here making war and writing constitutions and debating points of economic structure so are aaron burr and the marquis de lafayette they wear the clothes  by paul tazewell  you might expect them to wear in a traditional costume drama and the big stage they inhabit has been done up  by david korins  to suggest a period-appropriate tavern where incendiary youth might gather to drink brawl and plot revolution 
 in his review of the broadway production for  wrote  i love hamilton i love it like i love new york or broadway when it gets it right and this is so right a sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop  as well as r b britpop and trad showstoppers  under-dramatized american history and miranda s uniquely personal focus as a first-generation puerto rican and inexhaustible wordsmith hamilton hits multilevel culture buttons hard the work s human drama and novelistic density remain astonishing  he chose hamilton as a critics  pick and gave the production five out of five stars a review in  notes that the production enjoys  near-universal critical acclaim   joked that admiration for the musical is  the only thing  and i agree on

concept






the names of many main characters including that of  are given a unique melodic motif that is repeated throughout the musical hamilton in various keys tempos and timbres depending on the context this is one example of how hamilton weaves melodic and lyrical reprises into later songs in the score in order to cue an emotional response 

according to an article in  the show is  an achievement of historical and cultural reimagining  the costumes and set reflect the period with  velvet frock coats and knee britches the setis a wooden scaffold against exposed brick  the warm lighting suggests candlelight  the musical is mostly  with little dialogue isolated outside of the musical score casting diversity
miranda said that the portrayal of hamilton   and other white historical figures by black and hispanic actors should not require any substantial  by audience members  our cast looks like america looks now and that s certainly intentional  he said  it s a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door  he noted  we re telling the story of old dead white men but we re using actors of color and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience 
the pro-immigration message of hamilton is at the forefront as the show revolves around the life of one of the founding fathers of america alexander hamilton and how he made his mark in american politics as an immigrant instead of being characterized as a white person alexander hamilton s immigrant status would be referenced throughout the whole show alongside with the virtue and prowess of hamilton  by working a lot harder by being a lot smarter by being a self-starter  described in the show s opening  in order to foster a positive image of immigrants alongside this the casting of black latino and asian american leads allowed audiences to literally view america as a nation of immigrants with the intention of showing how irrelevant the founding fathers  whiteness is to their claim on the country  hamilton is a story about america and the most beautiful thing about it is it s told by such a diverse cast with a such diverse styles of music  according to renee elise goldberry who played angelica schuyler  we have the opportunity to reclaim a history that some of us don t necessarily think is our own  miranda has stated that he is  totally open  to women playing the founding fathers casting for the british production is expected to feature predominantly black british artists historical accuracy
chronology and events
although hamilton was based on true events miranda did use some dramatic license in retelling the story for example while angelica did have a strong relationship with hamilton it was exaggerated in the show during  satisfied  angelica explains why hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him in particular she states  i m a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich my father has no sons so i m the one who has to social climb for one  in actuality angelica had less pressure on her to do this  actually had fifteen children including two sons who survived into adulthood  one of whom was new york state assemblyman   and angelica had eloped with  three years before she met hamilton at her sister s wedding when she was already mother of two of her eight children with church miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if angelica is available but cannot marry him in addition in act i burr s role in hamilton s life is overstated and much of the early interactions between the two men in the show are fictionalized for example while burr was present at the battle on monmouth burr did not serve as charles lee s second in his duel with john laurens as seen in  ten duel commandments  lee s second was evan edwards hamilton also never approached burr to help write the federalist papers as portrayed in  non-stop  during act i the character of aaron burr says that martha washington named her feral tomcat after him    to which alexander hamilton replies   that s true  in fact it is false the idea of hamilton as a serial adulterer has been one of the biggest mischaracterizations of the real alexander hamilton for centuries with celebrated authors repeating the story over and over again notwithstanding that the sexual connotation of tomcat as a womanizer did not appear in dictionaries until the first half of the 20th century the  tomcat  story has been previously discredited by author stephen knott and refuted by historian and author michael e newton at the  alexander hamilton discoveries and findings  talk held by the alexander hamilton awareness society at    as part of the 2016 celebratehamilton events in act ii there are multiple inaccuracies throughout hamilton s decline probably due to time constraints and narrative arc while it is true that john adams and hamilton did not particularly get along john adams did not fire hamilton as told in the show hamilton tendered his resignation from his position as secretary of the treasury on december 1 1794 two years before adams became president however hamilton remained close friends with washington and highly influential in the political sphere in addition jefferson madison and burr did not approach hamilton about his affair it was actually   and  in december 1792 monroe was a close friend of jefferson s and shared the information of hamilton s affair with him in the summer of 1797 journalist  broke the story of hamilton s infidelity hamilton blamed monroe and the altercation nearly ended in a duel with nothing left to do hamilton then published the reynolds pamphlet in  blow us all away   and  engage in a duel before the events of the 1800 presidential election the duel actually occurred in 1801 with philip hamilton dying on november 24 in the show eacker fires on philip at the count of seven while what happened in real-life is almost the opposite  both men refused to fire for over a minute before eacker shot philip in the hips lastly it was not the presidential election of 1800 that led to burr and hamilton s duel burr did become jefferson s vice-president but when jefferson decided to not run with burr for reelection in 1804 burr opted to run for  instead burr lost to  in a landslide afterwards a letter was published from  to philip schuyler claiming that hamilton called burr  a dangerous man and one who ought not be trusted with the reins of government  and that he knew of  a still more despicable opinion which general hamilton has expressed of mr burr  this led to the letters between burr and hamilton as seen in the show in  your obedient servant 
critical analysis and scholarship
the show has been critiqued for a simplistic depiction of hamilton and vilification of jefferson  a history professor at  contrasted the show s hamilton to the  real hamilton  was a mass of contradictions  an immigrant who sometimes distrusted immigrants a revolutionary who placed a supreme value on law and order a man who distrusted the rumblings of the masses yet preached his politics to them more frequently and passionately than many of his more democracy-friendly fellows 
australian historian shane white found the framing of the show s story  troubling  stating that he and many historian colleagues  would like to imagine that hamilton is a last convulsion of the founding father mythology  according to white miranda s depiction of the founding of the united states  infuses new life into an older view of american history  that centered on the founding fathers instead of joining the many historians who were  attempting to get away from the   by incorporating  ordinary people african-americans native americans and women  into a  more inclusive and nuanced  historical narrative in which hamilton has a  cameo rather than leading role 
 professor lyra monteiro criticized the show s multi-ethnic casting as obscuring a complete lack of identifiable enslaved or free persons of color as characters in the show monteiro identified other commentators such as ishmael reed who criticized the show for making hamilton and other historical personages appear more progressive on racial injustice than they really were according to reed  hamilton s  reputation has been shored up as an abolitionist and someone who was opposed to slavery  which reed stated was untrue in  policy analyst matt stoller criticized the musical s portrayal of hamilton as an idealist committed to democratic principles in contrast to what he characterized as the historical record of hamilton s reactionary anti-democratic politics and legacy for example stoller cited hamilton as a leader involved in the   a military coup plot against the continental congress in 1783  his development of a national financial system which in stoller s view empowered the plutocratic elite  and his use of military force indefinite detention and mass arrests against dissenters during the  of 1791 in 2007 history writer william hogeland criticized chernow s biography of hamilton on similar grounds in the  use in education
 wrote of a  growing number of intrepid u.s history teachers...who are harnessing the hamilton phenomenon to inspire their students  the cabinet rap battles provide a way to engage students with topics that have traditionally been considered uninteresting an elective course for 11th and 12th graders on the musical hamilton was held at the  in new york kqed news added that  hamilton is especially galvanizing for the student who believes that stories about 18th century america are distant and irrelevant  as it shows the founding fathers were real humans with real feeling and real flaws rather than  bloodless two-dimensional cutouts who devoted their lives to abstract principles  a high school teacher from the bronx noted his students were  singing these songs the way they might sing the latest release from drake or adele  one teacher focused on hamilton s ability to write his way out of trouble and toward a higher plane of existence   skilled writing is the clearest sign of scholarshipand the best way to rise up and alter your circumstance 
hamilton s producers have made a pledge to allow 20,000  students from low-income families to get subsidized tickets to see hamilton on broadway by reducing their tickets to  70 for students and the  provided  1.5million to further lower ticket prices to  10 per student the  created a study guide to accompany the student-ticket program the website educationworld writes that hamilton is  being praised for its revitalization of interest in civic education   announced plans to offer course work in 2017 inspired by hamilton in history latino studies and interdisciplinary studies in 2016 moraine valley community college started a hamilton appreciation movement straight outta hamilton hosting panels and events that talk about the musical itself and relate them to current events legacy and impact
