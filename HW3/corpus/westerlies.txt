the westerlies  blue  and trade winds  yellow 


the westerlies anti-trades or prevailing westerlies are  from the west toward the east in the  between 30 and 60 degrees  they originate from the high-pressure areas in the  and tend towards the  and steer  in this general manner  which cross the  axis into the westerlies recurve due to the increased westerly flow the  are predominantly from the southwest in the  and from the northwest in the  the westerlies are strongest in the winter hemisphere and times when the pressure is lower over the poles while they are weakest in the summer hemisphere and when pressures are higher over the poles the westerlies are particularly strong especially in the southern hemisphere in areas where land is absent because land amplifies the flow pattern making the current more north-south oriented slowing the westerlies the strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes can come in the  between 40 and 50 degrees latitude the westerlies play an important role in carrying the warm equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse

if the  were a non-rotating  solar heating would cause winds across the mid-latitudes to blow in a poleward direction away from the subtropical ridge however the  caused by the rotation of earth causes winds to steer to the right of what would otherwise be expected across the northern hemisphere and left of what would be expected in the southern hemisphere this is why winds across the northern hemisphere tend to blow from the southwest but they tend to be from the northwest in the southern hemisphere when pressures are lower over the poles the strength of the westerlies increases which has the effect of warming the mid-latitudes this occurs when the  is positive and during winter low pressure near the poles is stronger than it would be during the summer when it is negative and pressures are higher over the poles the flow is more meridional blowing from the direction of the pole towards the equator which brings cold air into the mid-latitudes throughout the year the westerlies vary in strength with the  as the cyclone reaches its maximum intensity in  the westerlies increase in strength as the cyclone reaches its weakest intensity in  the westerlies weaken an example of the impact of the westerlies is when dust plumes originating in the  combine with pollutants and spread large distances downwind or eastward into  the westerlies can be particularly strong especially in the southern hemisphere where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the progression of west to east winds to slow down in the southern hemisphere because of the stormy and cloudy conditions it is usual to refer to the westerlies as the roaring forties furious fifties and shrieking sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude impact on ocean currents

due to persistent winds from west to east on the poleward sides of the subtropical ridges located in the atlantic and pacific oceans  are driven in a similar manner in both hemispheres the currents in the northern hemisphere are weaker than those in the southern hemisphere due to the differences in strength between the westerlies of each hemisphere the process of  causes currents on the western boundary of an ocean basin to be stronger than those on the eastern boundary of an ocean these western ocean currents transport warm tropical water polewards toward the  ships crossing both oceans have taken advantage of the ocean currents for centuries the   acc  or the west wind drift is an  that flows from west to east around  the acc is the dominant circulation feature of the  and at approximately 125  the largest ocean current in the northern hemisphere the  part of the north atlantic subtropical  has led to the development of strong  of all types at the base of the westerlies both within the  and within the  the kuroshio   for  black tide  is a strong  in the western north  similar to the gulf stream which has also contributed to the depth of ocean storms in that region extratropical cyclones

main article  
an extratropical cyclone is a   weather system that has neither tropical nor  characteristics being connected with  and horizontal  in  and  otherwise known as  baroclinic zones  the descriptor  extratropical  refers to the fact that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside of the tropics in the middle latitudes of the planet where the westerlies steer the system generally from west to east these systems may also be described as  mid-latitude cyclones  due to their area of formation or  post-tropical cyclones  where  has occurred and are often described as  depressions  or  lows  by weather forecasters and the general public these are the everyday phenomena which along with  drive the weather over much of the earth although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as  since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient they can sometimes become  late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform along the radius from the center of low pressure an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm and from there into a tropical cyclone if it dwells over warm waters and develops central convection which warms its core and causes temperature and dewpoint gradients near their centers to fade interaction with tropical cyclones

when a tropical cyclone crosses the  axis normally through a break in the  caused by a system traversing the westerlies its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low-pressure area to its north when the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component the cyclone has begun recurvature entering the westerlies a typhoon moving through the pacific ocean towards asia for example will recurve offshore of japan to the north and then to the northeast if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds  blowing northeastward  around a low-pressure system passing over  or  many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by  in this manner which move from west to east to the north of the subtropical ridge an example of a tropical cyclone in recurvature was  in 2006 which took a similar trajectory see also
