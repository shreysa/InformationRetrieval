the origins of inez were from a  that formed over the  in central africa on september15 from the  it moved westward in the  exiting the west coast of africa on september18 the precursor to inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave which was considered a tropical depression by september18 in the annual tropical cyclone summary tracked by satellites the system moved to the west-southwest and was officially classified a tropical depression on september21 about halfway between the lesser antilles and africa the system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest a  flight indicated some intensification in the system prompting the   nhc  to initiate advisories on tropical storm inez located about 800mi  1,300km  east of  with warm  the storm developed a circular area of  over its center inez slowed while curving westward around a  to its north and quickly intensified reaching hurricane status on september26 on september27 inez strengthened to reach winds of 120mph  195km h  making it a category3 hurricane on the  later that day it moved directly over the island of  at the time inez was a small cyclone with hurricane-force winds extending 50mi  80km  from the center  meteorologists labeled it as a  micro-hurricane because of its characteristic small tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind  its structure became disrupted by the island and the  rose from 961mbar  28.4inhg  to 970mbar  29inhg  indicative of weakening however inez re-intensified after entering the eastern caribbean sea reaching a minimum pressure of 929mbar  27.4inhg  south of  on september28 the hurricane hunters reported  of 197mph  317km h  at a height of 8,000ft  2,400m  the strongest winds recorded for the storm the same flight estimated surface winds between 150 to 175mph  241 to 282km h  near the center the peak intensity listed in the  is 150mph  240km h  making inez a strong  hurricane
