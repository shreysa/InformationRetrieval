 with its small cdo


the central dense overcast or cdo of a  or strong  is the large central area of  surrounding its circulation center caused by the formation of its eyewall it can be round angular oval or irregular in shape this feature shows up in tropical cyclones of tropical storm or hurricane strength how far the center is embedded within the cdo and the temperature difference between the cloud tops within the cdo and the cyclone s eye can help determine a tropical cyclone s intensity locating the center within the cdo can be a problem for strong tropical storms and with systems of minimal hurricane strength as its location can be obscured by the cdo s high cloud canopy this center location problem can be resolved through the use of microwave satellite imagery after a  reaches hurricane intensity an  appears at the center of the cdo defining its center of  and its cyclonic wind field tropical cyclones with changing intensity have more lightning within their cdo than  storms tracking cloud features within the cdo using frequently updated  can also be used to determine its intensity the highest  within a tropical cyclone as well as its heaviest rainfall are usually located under the coldest cloud tops in the cdo

southern hemisphere tropical  with a large cdo surrounding its eye


it is a large region of thunderstorms surrounding the center of stronger tropical and subtropical cyclones which shows up brightly  with cold cloud tops  on  the cdo forms due to the development of an eyewall within a tropical cyclone its shape can be round oval angular or irregular its development can be preceded by a narrow dense c-shaped  early in its development the cdo is often angular or oval in shape which rounds out increases in size and appears more smooth as a tropical cyclone intensifies rounder cdo shapes occur in environments with low levels of vertical  the strongest winds within  tend to be located under the deepest  within the cdo which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops the  is usually collocated with the coldest cloud tops within the cdo which is also the area where a tropical cyclone s rainfall reaches its maximum intensity for mature tropical cyclones that are steady state the cdo contains nearly no  activity though lightning is more common within weaker tropical cyclones and for systems fluctuating in intensity eye 
main article  
the eye is a region of mostly calm  at the center of the cdo of strong  the eye of a  is a roughly circular area typically 3065km  2040miles  in  it is surrounded by the eyewall a ring of towering  surrounding its center of circulation the cyclone s lowest  occurs in the eye and can be as much as 15 lower than the  outside the storm in weaker tropical cyclones the eye is less well-defined and can be covered by high cloudiness caused by  outflow from the surrounding central dense overcast 
use as a tropical cyclone strength indicator 




common developmental patterns seen during tropical cyclone development and their dvorak-assigned intensities

within the dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones there are several  that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity the central dense overcast  cdo  pattern is one of those patterns the central dense overcast utilizes the size of the cdo the cdo pattern intensities start at t2.5 equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity 40mph  64km h  the shape of the central dense overcast is also considered the farther the center is tucked into the cdo the stronger it is deemed banding features can be utilized to objectively determine the tropical cyclone s center using a ten degree  using the 8592ghz channels of polar-orbiting microwave satellite imagery can definitively locate the center within the cdo tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65mph  105km h  and 100mph  160km h  can have their center of circulations obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the cdo using rapid scan  whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half-hour
