fog in the form of a cloud descends upon a  community in the western us while leaving the mountain exposed 






heavy fog over  dissipates into a beautiful sky near the  river 


fog consists of visible cloud  droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air at or near the  s surface fog can be considered a type of low-lying  and is heavily influenced by nearby bodies of water  and wind conditions in turn fog has affected many human activities such as shipping travel and warfare

definition 
the term  fog  is typically distinguished from the more generic term  cloud  in that fog is low-lying and the moisture in the fog is often generated locally  such as from a nearby body of water like a lake or the ocean or from nearby moist ground or   by definition fog reduces  to less than 1 kilometre  0.62mi  whereas  causes lesser impairment of visibility for aviation purposes in the uk a visibility of less than 5 kilometres  3.1mi  but greater than 999 metres  3,278ft  is considered to be mist if the  is 70 or greater  below 70  is reported see also

up-close view of water particles forming fog


fog forms when the difference between air temperature and  is less than 2.5 or 4 fog begins to form when   into tiny liquid water droplets suspended in the air six examples of ways that water vapor is added to the air are by wind convergence into areas of upward motion  precipitation or  falling from above  daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land   from plants  cool or dry air moving over warmer water  and lifting air over mountains water vapor normally begins to condense on  such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds fog like its elevated cousin  is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass fog normally occurs at a  near 100 this occurs from either added moisture in the air or falling ambient air temperature however fog can form at lower humidities and can sometimes fail to form with relative humidity at 100 at 100 relative humidity the air cannot hold additional moisture thus the air will become  if additional moisture is added fog can form suddenly and can dissipate just as rapidly the sudden formation of fog is known as  flash fog  fog commonly produces  in the form of  or very light snow drizzle occurs when the humidity of fog attains 100 and the minute cloud droplets begin to coalesce into larger droplets this can occur when the fog layer is lifted and cooled sufficiently or when it is forcibly compressed from above by descending air drizzle becomes freezing drizzle when the temperature at the surface drops below the freezing point the thickness of a fog layer is largely determined by the altitude of the inversion boundary which in coastal or oceanic locales is also the top of the  above which the air mass is warmer and drier the inversion boundary varies its altitude primarily in response to the weight of the air above it which is measured in terms of atmospheric pressure the marine layer and any fogbank it may contain will be  squashed  when the pressure is high and conversely may expand upwards when the pressure above it is lowering types 
fog can form in a number of ways depending on how the cooling that caused the  occurred radiation fog is formed by the cooling of land after sunset by  in calm conditions with a clear sky the cooling ground then cools adjacent air  causing the air temperature to fall below the dew point forming fog in perfect calm the fog layer can be less than a meter thick but  can promote a thicker layer radiation fogs occur at night and usually doesn t last long after sunrise but it can persist all day in the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter examples of this phenomenon include the  ground fog is fog that obscures less than 60 of the sky and does not extend to the base of any overhead clouds however the term is usually a synonym for radiation fog which is very shallow  in some cases the depth of the fog is on the order of tens of centimeters over certain kinds of terrain with the absence of wind

advection fog occurs when moist air passes over a cool surface by   wind  and is cooled it is common as a  passes over an area with significant snow-pack it is most common at sea when moist air encounters cooler waters including areas of cold water  such as along the california coast  see   a strong enough temperature difference over water or bare ground can also cause advection fog although strong winds often mix the air and can disperse fragment or prevent many kinds of fog markedly warmer and humid air blowing over a snowpack can continue to generate advection fog at elevated velocities up to 50 mph 80 km h or more  this fog will be in a turbulent rapidly moving and comparatively shallow layer observed as inches a few cm in depth over flat farm fields flat urban terrain and the like and or form more complex forms where the terrain is different such as rotating areas in the lee of hills or large buildings and so on the advection of fog along the california coastline is propelled onto land by one of several processes a cold front can push the marine layer coast-ward an occurrence most typical in the spring or late fall during the summer months a low pressure trough produced by intense heating inland creates a strong pressure gradient drawing in the dense marine layer also during the summer strong high pressure aloft over the desert southwest usually in connection with the summer  produces a south to southeasterly flow which can drive the offshore marine layer up the coastline  a phenomenon known as a  southerly surge  typically following a coastal heat spell however if the monsoonal flow is sufficiently turbulent it might instead break up the marine layer and any fog it may contain moderate turbulence will typically transform a fog bank lifting it and breaking it up into shallow convective clouds called  evaporation fog or steam fog forms over bodies of water overlain by much colder air  this situation can also lead to  forming lake effect fog is of this type sometimes in combination with other causes like radiation fog it tends to differ from most advective fog formed over land in that it is like  a convective phenomenon resulting in fog which can be quite a bit denser deeper and looks fluffy from above most other fog is stratiform  steam devils which look like their  are often seen in this situation frontal fog forms near a front when raindrops falling from relatively warm air above a frontal surface evaporate into cooler air close to the earth s surface and cause it to become saturated ice fog forming in very low temperatures can be the result of other mechanisms mentioned here as well as the exhalation of moist warm air by herds of animals it can be associated with the  form of precipitation in which very small crystals of ice form and slowly fall this often occurs during blue sky conditions which can cause many types of halos and other results of refraction of sunlight by the airborne crystals freezing fog which deposits  is composed of droplets of  which freezes to surfaces on contact precipitation fog  or frontal fog  forms as  falls into drier air below the cloud the liquid droplets  into water vapor the water vapor cools and at the dewpoint it condenses and fog forms hail fog sometimes occurs in the vicinity of significant  accumulations due to decreased temperature and increased moisture leading to saturation in a very shallow layer near the surface it most often occurs when there is a warm humid layer atop the hail and when wind is light this ground fog tends to be localized but can be extremely dense and abrupt it may form shortly after the hail falls  when the hail has had time to cool the air and as it  when  and  upslope fog forms when moist air is going up the slope of a mountain or hill which condenses into fog on account of  and to a lesser extent the drop in pressure with altitude freezing conditions 
freezing fog occurs when liquid fog droplets freeze to surfaces forming white  or  this is very common on mountain tops which are exposed to low clouds it is equivalent to  and essentially the same as the ice that forms inside a freezer which is not of the  frostless  or  frost-free  type the term  freezing fog  may also refer to fog where water vapor is super-cooled filling the air with small ice crystals similar to very light snow it seems to make the fog  tangible  as if one could  grab a handful  in the western united states freezing fog may be referred to as pogonip it occurs commonly during cold winter spells usually in deep mountain valleys the word pogonip is derived from the  word painappih which means  cloud  in  in the calendar for december the phrase  beware the pogonip  regularly appears in his anthology smoke bellew  described a pogonip which surrounded the main characters killing one of them the phenomenon is also extremely common in the inland areas of the pacific northwest with temperatures in the 10 to 30f  12 to 1c  range the columbia plateau experiences this phenomenon most years due to temperature inversions sometimes lasting for as long as three weeks the fog typically begins forming around the area of the columbia river and expands sometimes covering the land to distances as far away as  almost 150 miles  240km  due south of the river and into south central washington frozen fog  also known as   is any kind of fog where the droplets have  into extremely tiny  of  in midair generally this requires temperatures at or below 35c  31f  making it common only in and near the  and  regions it is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called  often reported in  alaska ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of

up-slope fog or hill fog forms when winds blow air up a   called    it as it rises and causing the moisture in it to condense this often causes freezing fog on mountaintops where the  would not otherwise be low enough valley fog forms in mountain  often during winter it is essentially a radiation fog confined by local  and can last for several days in calm conditions in california s  valley fog is often referred to as  sea and coastal fog 
sea fog  also known as  or fret  is heavily influenced by the presence of  and microscopic airborne  crystals clouds of all types require minute  particles upon which water vapor can condense over the ocean surface the most common particles are salt from salt  produced by breaking waves except in areas of storminess the most common areas of breaking waves are located near coastlines hence the greatest densities of airborne salt particles are there condensation on salt particles has been observed to occur at humidities as low as 70 thus fog can occur even in relatively dry air in suitable locations such as the california coast typically such lower humidity fog is preceded by a transparent mistiness along the coastline as condensation competes with evaporation a phenomenon that is typically noticeable by beachgoers in the afternoon another recently discovered source of condensation nuclei for coastal fog is  seaweed researchers have found that under stress  intense sunlight strong evaporation etc  kelp releases particles of  which in turn become nuclei for condensation of water vapor causing fog that diffuses direct sunlight  also called  fog or evaporation fog is the most localized form and is created by cold air passing over warmer water or moist land it often causes freezing fog or sometimes  arctic sea smoke is similar to  but occurs when the air is very cold instead of condensing into water droplets columns of freezing rising and condensing water vapor is formed the water vapor produces the sea smoke fog and is usually misty and smoke-like  fog near the coast of  and  occurs when typical fog produced by the sea travels inland but suddenly meets an area of hot air this causes the water particles of fog to shrink by evaporation producing a  transparent mist  garua fog is nearly invisible yet it still forces drivers to use  because of deposition of liquid water on hard surfaces

visibility effects 




heavy fog on a road near 






light fog reduces visibility on a suburban street rendering the cyclist very hazy at about 200m  220yd  the limit of visibility is about 400m  440yd  which is before the end of the street 

depending on the concentration of the droplets visibility in fog can range from the appearance of haze to almost zero visibility many lives are lost each year worldwide from accidents involving fog conditions on the highways including  the aviation travel industry is affected by the severity of fog conditions even though modern  computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot personnel manning an airport  must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff safe operations are difficult in thick fog and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve a solution for landing returning military aircraft developed in world war ii was called   fido  it involved burning enormous amounts of fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft the high energy demands of this method discourage its use for routine operations shadows 




 casts a 3-dimensional fog shadow


shadows are cast through fog in three dimensions the fog is dense enough to be illuminated by light that passes through gaps in a structure or tree but thin enough to let a large quantity of that light pass through to illuminate points further on as a result object shadows appear as  beams  oriented in a direction parallel to the light source these voluminous shadows are created the same way as  which are the shadows of clouds in fog it is solid objects that cast shadows sound propagation and acoustic effects

sound typically travels fastest and farthest through solids then liquids then gases such as the atmosphere sound is affected during fog conditions due to the small distances between water droplets and air temperature differences molecular effect  though fog is essentially liquid water the many droplets are separated by small air gaps high-pitched sounds have a high frequency which in turn means they have a short wavelength to transmit a high frequency wave air must move back and forth very quickly short-wavelength high-pitched sound waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets partially cancelling and dissipating their energy  a process called   in contrast low pitched notes with a low frequency and a long wavelength move the air less rapidly and less often and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further which is why  use a low-pitched tone temperature effect  a fog can be caused by a  where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog while warmer air sits above it the inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back toward the ground allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface a temperature inversion increases the distance that lower frequency sounds can travel by reflecting the sound between the ground and the inversion layer record extremes is  followed closely by the  off the coast of   the meeting place of the cold  from the north and the much warmer  from the south  some of the foggiest land areas in the world include   newfoundland  and   california  each with over 200 foggy days per year  even in generally warmer southern europe thick fog and localized fog are often found in lowlands and valleys such as the lower part of the  and the  and  valleys in italy   valley in northeastern spain  as well as on the  especially in the  area in late autumn and winter  other notably foggy areas include coastal   in the south  coastal     and the  islands as a water source 
 forests in california receive approximately 3040 of their moisture from coastal fog by way of  change in climate patterns could result in relative drought in these areas some animals including insects depend on wet fog as a principal source of water particularly in otherwise desert climes as along many african coastal areas some coastal communities use  to extract moisture from the atmosphere where groundwater pumping and rainwater collection are insufficient artificial fog 
artificial fog is man-made fog that is usually created by vaporizing a water andbased orbased fluid the fluid is injected into a heated metal block and evaporates quickly the resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent upon coming into contact with cool outside air the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog such  are primarily used for  historical references

the presence of fog has often played a key role in historical events such as strategic battles one example is the   august 27 1776  when american general  and his command were able to evade imminent capture by the british army using fog to conceal their escape another example is   june 6 1944  during  when the allies landed on the beaches of  during fog conditions both positive and negative results were reported from both sides during that battle due to impaired visibility
