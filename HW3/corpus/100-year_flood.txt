a one-hundred-year flood is a  event that has a 1 probability of occurring in any given year the 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1 flood since its annual exceedance probability is 1 for river systems the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate the flood  level can be mapped as an area of inundation the resulting  map is referred to as the 100-year floodplain estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the united states are available in the uk the  publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of   and  maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits environmental regulations and

probability 
a common misunderstanding exists that a 100-year flood is likely to occur only once in a 100-year period in fact there is approximately a 63.4 chance of one or more 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period on the  river at  germany the actual intervals between 100-year floods during 1501 to 2013 ranged from 37 to 192 years the probability pe that one or more floods occurring during any period will exceed a given flood threshold can be expressed using the  as

where t is the threshold   e.g 100-yr 50-yr 25-yr and so forth  and n is the number of years in the period the  pe is also described as the natural inherent or hydrologic risk of failure however the  of the number of 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period is 1 ten-year floods have a 10 chance of occurring in any given year  pe  0.10  500-year have a 0.2 chance of occurring in any given year  pe  0.002  etc the percent chance of an x-year flood occurring in a single year can be calculated by dividing 100 by x a similar analysis is commonly applied to  or rainfall data the  of a storm is rarely identical to that of an associated riverine flood because of rainfall timing and location variations among different  the field of  was created to model rare events such as 100-year floods for the purposes of civil engineering this theory is most commonly applied to the maximum or minimum observed stream flows of a given river in desert areas where there are only ephemeral washes this method is applied to the maximum observed rainfall over a given period of time  24-hours 6-hours or 3-hours  the extreme value analysis only considers the most extreme event observed in a given year so between the large spring runoff and a heavy summer rain storm whichever resulted in more runoff would be considered the extreme event while the smaller event would be ignored in the analysis  even though both may have been capable of causing terrible flooding in their own right  statistical assumptions 
there are a number of  which are made to complete the analysis which determines the 100-year flood first the extreme events observed in each year must be  from year-to-year in other words the maximum river flow rate from 1984 cannot be found to be   with the observed flow rate in 1985 1985 cannot be correlated with 1986 and so forth the second assumption is that the observed extreme events must come from the same  the third assumption is that the probability distribution relates to the largest storm  rainfall or river flow rate measurement  that occurs in any one year the fourth assumption is that the probability distribution function is stationary meaning that the   average   and  values are not increasing or decreasing over time this concept is referred to as  the first assumption is often but not always valid and should be tested on a case by case basis the second assumption is often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions for example if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms  as is the case in the southwest u.s  or from snow pack melting  as is the case in north-central u.s  then this assumption should be valid if however there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms others from snow pack melting and others from hurricanes then this assumption is most likely not valid the third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low but maximum flow event  for example an event smaller than a 2-year flood  since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis or in civil engineering design then the situation rarely presents itself the final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest flood records  see next section  more broadly substantial evidence of  strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult the simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are or can be considered valid as input into the extreme event analysis probability uncertainty 
when these assumptions are violated there is an unknown amount of uncertainty introduced into the reported value of what the 100-year flood means in terms of rainfall intensity or flood depth when all of the inputs are known the uncertainty can be measured in the form of a confidence interval for example one might say there is a 95 chance that the 100-year flood is greater than x but less than y direct statistical analysis to estimate the 100-year riverine flood is possible only at the relatively few locations where an annual series of maximum instantaneous flood discharges has been recorded in the united states as of 2014 taxpayers have supported such records for at least 60 years at fewer than 2,600 locations for at least 90 years at fewer than 500 and for at least 120 years at only 11 for comparison the total area of the nation is about 3,800,000 square miles  9,800,000km2  so there are perhaps 3,000 stream reaches that drain watersheds of 1,000 square miles  2,600km2  and 300,000 reaches that drain 10 square miles  26km2  in urban areas 100-year flood estimates are needed for watersheds as small as 1 square mile  2.6km2  for reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis 100-year flood estimates are derived from  of flood records at other locations in a hydrologically similar region or from other  similarly for coastal floods  data exist for only about 1,450 sites worldwide of which only about 950 have added information to the global data center since january 2010

much longer records of flood elevations exist at a few locations around the world such as the  river at  germany but they must be evaluated carefully for accuracy and completeness before any statistical interpretation for an individual stream reach the uncertainties in any analysis can be large so 100-year flood estimates have large individual uncertainties for most stream reaches 24 for the largest recorded flood at any specific location or any potentially larger event the recurrence interval always is poorly known 20,24 spatial variability adds more uncertainty because a flood peak observed at different locations on the same stream during the same event commonly represents a different recurrence interval at each location 20 if an extreme storm drops enough rain on one branch of a river to cause a 100-year flood but no rain falls over another branch the flood wave downstream from their junction might have a recurrence interval of only 10 years conversely a storm that produces a 25-year flood simultaneously in each branch might form a 100-year flood downstream during a time of flooding news accounts necessarily simplify the story by reporting the greatest damage and largest recurrence interval estimated at any location the public can easily and incorrectly conclude that the recurrence interval applies to all stream reaches in the flood area 7,24
observed intervals between floods 
peak elevations of 14 floods as early as 1501 on the  river at  germany reveal great variability in the actual intervals between floods 1619 flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501 and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood only half of the intervals between 50 and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of the nominal average interval similarly the intervals between 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years and only half were within 2.5 to 7.5 years

regulatory use 
in the united states the 100-year flood provides the risk basis for  rates complete information on the   nfip  is available  a regulatory flood or base flood is routinely established for river reaches through a science-based rule-making process targeted to a 100-year flood at the historical average recurrence interval in addition to historical flood data the process accounts for previously established regulatory values the effects of flood-control reservoirs and changes in land use in the watershed  hazards have been mapped by a similar approach that includes the relevant physical processes most areas where serious floods can occur in the united states have been mapped consistently in this manner on average nationwide those 100-year flood estimates are well sufficient for the purposes of the nfip and offer reasonable estimates of future flood risk if the future is like the past 24 approximately 3 of the u.s population lives in areas subject to the 1 annual chance coastal flood hazard see also
