description 

this description is based on the most common understanding of the de facto international date line see  below and map above at right 
the idl is roughly based on the  of 180 longitude roughly down the middle of the pacific ocean and halfway around the world from the  in many places the idl follows the 180 meridian exactly in other places however the idl deviates east or west away from that meridian these various deviations generally accommodate the political and or economic affiliations of the affected areas proceeding from north to south the first deviation of the idl from 180 is to pass to the east of  and the  the easternmost part of russian   wrangel island lies directly on the meridian at 7132n 1800e also noted as 7132n 1800w  it then passes through the  between the  at a distance of 1.5 kilometres  0.93mi  from each island at 1685837 w it then bends considerably west of 180 passing west of  and  the idl crosses between the u.s    being the westernmost  and the  which belong to russia it then bends southeast again to return to 180 thus all of russia is to the west of the idl and all of the united states is to the east except for the insular areas of guam the northern mariana islands and wake island the idl remains on the 180 meridian until passing the  two us-owned uninhabited atolls  and  just north of the equator in the central pacific ocean  and ships at sea between 172.5w and 180  have the latest time on earth   hours  the idl circumscribes  by swinging far to the east almost reaching the  kiribati s easternmost islands the southern  south of  have the most advanced time on earth  hours south of kiribati the idl returns westwards but remains east of 180 passing between  and  in much of this area the idl follows the  accordingly samoa      and new zealand s  and  are all west of the idl and have the same date american samoa the   and  are east of the idl and one day behind the idl then bends southwest to return to 180 it follows that meridian until reaching  which has  conventionally the idl is not drawn into antarctica on most maps  see  below 
circumnavigating the globe 
a person who goes  from east to west  the same direction as   would gain or set their clock back one hour for every 15 of longitude crossed and would gain 24 hours for one circuit of the globe from east to west if they did not compensate by setting their clock forward one day when they crossed the idl in contrast a west-to-east circumnavigation of the globe loses an hour for every 15 of longitude crossed but gains back a day when crossing the idl the idl must therefore be observed in conjunction with the earth s time zones  on crossing it in either direction the calendar date is adjusted by one day facts dependent on the idl 
for the two hours between 10 00 and 11 59  each day three different calendar dates are observed at the same time in different places on earth for example at 10 15 utc thursday it is 23 15 wednesday in american samoa   thursday in most of the world and 00 15 friday in    during the first hour  utc 10 0010 59  all three calendar dates include inhabited places during the second hour  utc 11 0011 59  one of the calendar dates is limited to an uninhabited maritime time zone twelve hours behind utc   according to the clock the first areas to experience a new day and a  are islands that use utc 14 these include portions of the  including  in the  as well as samoa during the southern summer the first major cities to experience a new day are  and  new zealand    with daylight saving time  a 1995 realignment of the idl made caroline island one of the first points of land on earth to reach january 1 2000 on the calendar   as a result this  was renamed  the areas that are the first to see the daylight of a new day vary by the season around the  the first area would be anyplace within the    that is far enough north to experience  on the given date at the  the first place to see daylight would be the uninhabited  in kiribati which is the easternmost land located west of the idl near the  the first places would be  using   utc 13  during summer that experience midnight sun these include    and  de facto and de jure date lines 
there are two ways  and thereby the location of the international date line are determined one on land and adjacent  and the other on open seas all nations unilaterally determine their standard  applicable only on land and adjacent territorial waters this date line can be called  since it is not based on international law but on national laws these national zones do not extend into international waters the  not the same as the idl is a  construction determined by international agreement it is the result of the 1917  which recommended that all ships both military and civilian adopt hourly standard time zones on the high seas the united states adopted its recommendation for u.s military and merchant marine ships in 1920 this date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps it follows the  except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land forming gapsit is a pole-to-pole dashed line the 15 gore that is offset from utc by 12 hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5 gores that differ from utc by 12 hours ships are supposed to adopt the standard time of a country if they are within its territorial waters within 12 nautical miles  14mi  22km  of land then revert to international time zones  15 wide pole-to-pole   as soon as they leave in reality ships use these time zones only for radio communication and similar purposes for internal purposes such as work and meal hours ships use a time zone of their own choosing cartographic practice and convention 
the idl on the map on this page and all other maps is based on the de facto line and is an artificial construct of cartographers as the precise course of the line in international waters is arbitrary the idl does not extend into antarctica on the world time zone maps by the united states   cia  or the united kingdom s   hmnao  the idl on modern cia maps now reflects the most recent shifts in the idl  see  below  the current hmnao map does not draw the idl in conformity with recent shifts in the idl  it draws a line virtually identical to that adopted by the uk s hydrographic office about 1900 instead hmnao labels island groups with their time zones which do reflect the most recent idl shifts this approach is consistent with the principle of national and nautical time zones  the islands of eastern kiribati are actually  islands  of asian date  west side of idl  in a sea of american date  east side of idl  no international organization nor any treaty between nations has fixed the idl drawn by cartographers  the 1884  explicitly refused to propose or agree to any time zones stating that they were outside its  the conference resolved that the universal day midnight-to-midnight   now known as   which it did agree to  shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable  from this comes the utility and importance of utc or  z  zulu  time  it permits a single universal reference for time that is valid for all points on the globe at the same moment historical alterations

the  now divided into  and  were on the west side of the idl until 1892 in that year king  was persuaded by american traders to adopt the american date  three hours behind california  to replace the former asian date  four hours ahead of japan  the change was made by repeating 4 july 1892  in 2011 samoa shifted back to the west side of the idl by removing friday 30 december 2011 from its calendar this changed the timezone from  to  samoa made the change because  and  have become its biggest trading partners and also have large communities of expatriates being 21 hours behind made business difficult because having weekends on backward days meant only four days of the week were shared  the idl now passes between samoa and american samoa which remains on the east  american  side of the line  is a territory of new zealand north of samoa whose principal transportation and communications links with the rest of the world pass through  for that reason tokelau crossed the idl along with samoa in 2011 kwajalein  c 1945 and 1993 
 atoll like the rest of the  passed from spanish to german to japanese control during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries during that period it was west of the idl although kwajalein formally became part of the  with the rest of the marshalls after world war ii the united states established a military installation there because of that kwajalein used the hawaiian date so was effectively east of the international date line  unlike the rest of the marshalls  kwajalein returned to the west side of the idl by removing saturday 21 august 1993 from its calendar to match the dates used by the rest of the marshall islands at the request of its government along with the shift kwajalein s work week was changed to tuesday through saturday to match the hawaiian work week of monday through friday on the other side of the idl eastern kiribati  1995

date lines according to religious principles
further information  
generally the christian calendar and christian churches recognize the authority of the idl  for example is celebrated on 25 december  according to either the  or the  depending upon which of the two is used by the particular church  as that date falls in countries located on either side of the date line thus whether it is western christmas or orthodox christmas christians in samoa immediately west of the date line will celebrate the holiday a day before christians in american samoa which is immediately east of the date line a problem with the general rule above arises in certain christian churches that solemnly observe a sabbath day as a particular day of the week when those churches are located in countries near the date line notwithstanding the difference in dates the same sunrise happened over american samoa as happens over samoa a few minutes later and the same sunset happens over samoa as happened over american samoa a few minutes earlier in other words the secular days are legally different but they are physically the same  and that causes questions to arise under religious law because the date line was an arbitrary imposition the question can arise as to which saturday on either side of the date line  or more fundamentally on either side of 180 degrees longitude  is the  real  saturday this issue  which also arises in   is a particular problem for seventh day adventists seventh day baptists and similar churches located in countries near the date line in    who usually observe saturday the   observe sunday due to their understanding of the international date line as tonga lies east of the 180 meridian sunday as observed in tonga  as with kiribati samoa and parts of fiji and tuvalu  is considered by the seventh-day adventist church to be the same day as saturday observed in most other places most seventh day adventists in  planned to observe sabbath on sunday after samoa s crossing the date line in december 2011 but sda groups in samatau village and other places  approx 300 members  decided to accept the idl adjustment and observe the sabbath on saturday debate continues within the seventh-day adventist community in the pacific as to which day is really the seventh-day sabbath the samoan independent seventh-day adventist church which is not affiliated to the worldwide seventh-day adventist church has decided to continue worshiping on saturday after a six-day week at the end of 2011 islam 
similarly the  and  communities recognize the convention of the idl in particular the day for holding the  prayer appears to be local friday everywhere in the world the idl is not a factor in the start and end of islamic lunar months these depend solely on sighting the  as an example the fasts of the month of  begin the morning after the crescent is sighted that this day may vary in different parts of the world is well known in islam  see

for more details on this topic see  the concept of an international date line in jewish law is first mentioned by 12th-century decisors but it was not until the introduction of improved transportation and communications systems in the 20th century that the question of an international date line truly became a question of practical jewish law as a practical matter the conventional international date lineor another line in the pacific ocean close to itserves as a de facto date line for purposes of jewish law at least in existing jewish communities for example residents of the jewish communities of japan new zealand  and  all observe shabbat on local saturday however there is not unanimity as to how jewish law reaches that conclusion for this reason some authorities rule that certain aspects of sabbath observance are required on sunday  in japan and new zealand  or friday  in hawaii and french polynesia  in addition to saturday additionally there are differences of opinion as to which day or days individual jews traveling in the pacific region away from established jewish communities should observe shabbat for individuals crossing the date line the change of calendar date influences some aspects of practice under jewish law yet other aspects depend on an individual s experience of sunsets and sunrises to count days notwithstanding the calendar date cultural references and traditions
the date line is a central factor in  s book   1994  in which the protagonist finds himself on a becalmed ship with an island close at hand on the other side of the idl unable to swim the protagonist indulges in increasingly confused speculation regarding the physical metaphysical and religious import of the date line around the world in eighty days 
the concept behind the idl  though not the idl itself which did not yet exist  appears as a plot device in  s book   1873  the main protagonist  travels eastward around the world he had bet with his friends that he could do it in 80 days to win the wager fogg must return by 8 45pm on saturday 21 december 1872 however the journey suffers a series of delays and when fogg reaches london it s 8 50pm on friday 20 december although he believes it s saturday 21 december and that he has lost the wager by a margin of only five minutes the next day however it is revealed that the day is saturday not sunday and fogg arrives at his club just in time to win the bet verne explains 

in journeying eastward he  had gone towards the sun and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth  and these three hundred and sixty degrees multiplied by four minutes gives precisely twenty-four hoursthat is the day unconsciously gained in other words while phileas fogg going eastward saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times 
fogg had thought it was one day more than it actually was because he had forgotten this simple fact during his journey he had added a full day to his clock at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees or four minutes per degree as verne writes at the time the concept of a de jure international date line did not exist if it did he would have been made aware that it would be a day less than it used to be once he reached this line thus the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line but a de facto date line did exist since the uk india and the us had the same calendar with different local times and he should have noticed when he arrived to the us that the local date was not the same as in his diary  his servant jean passepartout kept his clock in london time despite the tips of his surroundings  line-crossing ceremonies relating to the idl
