the origins of hurricane cesar were from a  and an elongated area of  that emerged into the atlantic from the west coast of africa on july17 for several days the wave moved westward without any organization although an  aloft provided conditions favorable for  on july22  or thunderstorms increased along the wave as it approached the southern  surface  steadily dropped as the system moved through the  and a  began developing near  based on surface and satellite data it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression three at 1800 on july24 near  off the north coast of  operationally the   nhc  did not consider it as a tropical depression until 18hours later with an unusually strong  located over  the tropical depression moved westward through the southern caribbean near the northern coast of south america around 1200utc on july25 it struck the island of  which reported sustained winds of 45mph  75km h  the observation indicated the depression attained tropical storm status although operationally the depression wasn t upgraded until the next day at which point the nhc named the storm cesar after crossing curaao the storm moved near or over  in extreme northern  its proximity to south america prevented significant strengthening until late on july26 when the storm reached the open waters of the southwest caribbean sea 



cesar making landfall in 


on july27 cesar attained hurricane status about halfway between nicaragua and colombia later that day the hurricane passed over  island which is part of a small colombian archipelago off the east coast of nicaragua as cesar approached central america a 17mile  19km   formed surrounded by deep convection in the form of an eyewall at about 0400utc on july28 hurricane cesar made  just north of  nicaragua with winds of 75mph  140km h  it moved quickly west-northward through the country weakening to tropical storm status and emerging into the eastern pacific ocean by july29 this made cesar the most recent tropical cyclone to traverse from the atlantic to east pacific basin until otto achieved the same feat in 2016 in addition following the dissipation of cesardouglas there was a policy change which determined that future storms would retain their original name upon crossing into another basin upon reaching the pacific the system was  tropical depression seven-e but in a post-analysis it was determined the cyclone maintained tropical storm status while crossing central america once its status as a tropical storm was confirmed it was renamed tropical storm douglas at the time the agreement through the  was for storms to be renamed if they cross from the atlantic to the pacific as the storm moved westward it quickly intensified with an eye-like feature developing by 0900utc on july29 shortly thereafter douglas attained hurricane status about 115mi  185km  southwest of the guatemala mexico border around that time  anticipated two scenarios for the future of douglas  one was a northwest track to make landfall near  and the other was a continued west-northwest track while remaining offshore hurricane douglas ultimately took the latter track by late on july29 the eye of the hurricane was well-defined on mexican radar and with favorable upper-level  warm  and a climatologically favorable region for intense hurricanes the nhc forecast douglas to strengthen to winds of 115mph  185km h  the next day its structure became atypical of a strengthening hurricane and the eye was briefly not seen on satellite imagery on july31 douglas became much better organized as it turned more west-northwestward and it attained  or a category3 on the  about 205miles  330km  southwest of  by early on august1 douglas reached peak winds of 130mph  215km h  a category4 on the saffirsimpson scale later that day the hurricane attained its lowest pressure of 946 about 275miles  440km  south of the southern tip of the  douglas maintained peak intensity for 36hours until august2 when the eye became less-organized as the overall convection began to weaken weakening continued due to cooler waters as douglas turned to the west and on august3 the hurricane deteriorated to tropical storm status as a tropical storm there was minimal deep convection although the center remained very well-defined on august5 douglas weakened to tropical depression status and by the next day could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone the remnant circulation continued westward for several days preparations 
prior to cesar s arrival in venezuela a tropical storm warning was issued for areas west of  to the border with colombia  the warning was discontinued later that day the government of colombia issued a tropical storm warning on july25 from the border with venezuela to  as well as the islands of  and  these warnings were discontinued later that day after the storm s passage as cesar approached central america hurricane warnings were posted in nicaragua 31 hours before landfall leaving ample time to prepare for the hurricane with  occurring only 8 years prior 10,724 people were evacuated before and during the hurricane to take refuge at special camps on july29 shortly after cesar emerged into the pacific ocean and was reclassified tropical depression seven-e the government of mexico issued a  from  to  about 12hours later after the depression intensified into tropical storm douglas the mexican government canceled the watch and issued a new tropical storm warning from  to acapulco  this was due to the large extent of tropical storm force winds associated with douglas and its proximity to the south coast of mexico another tropical storm watch was briefly issued on july30 from acapulco to  impact 

hurricane cesar was a moisture-laden tropical cyclone that dropped heavy rains along its path through the southern  and central america damage was moderate to extreme due to mudslides and flooding and at least 113 people were killed lesser antilles and south america 
the precursor tropical wave to cesar produced rains and gusty winds through a large portion of the lesser antilles in venezuela heavy rains from the storm triggered flooding and landslides that killed at least five people in the capital city of  45 people were left homeless as a result of the storm although the storm passed directly over the region the  off the coast of colombia and venezuela received little rainfall peaking at 0.15in  3.8mm  on curaao peak gusts were also measured at 60mph  95km h  on the island the winds caused minor damage to roofs and trees across all three islands as well as rough surf that drowned one person in curaao as a tropical storm cesar struck the northern coastline of  bringing heavy rains and gusty winds at least three people were killed in storm related incidents two of which occurred when an avalanche buried a house in  in the northern part of the country cesar brought torrential rains to the  offshore eastern  eleven people were killed across the archipelago including eight children who died in a landslide across the islands 60 homes lost their roofs and numerous trees were felled due to high winds the local governor stated that losses from cesar reached 800million   440,00usd  nicaragua 
torrential rainfall was the immediate effect of cesar peaking at 10.7inches  271mm  at  with many other locations reporting over 6inches  150mm  the intense precipitation led to widespread mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country the most affected region was  where the water level was approaching dangerous levels the storm wrought extensive damage throughout the country leaving roughly  50.5million in damage behind large portions of the country s crops were affected resulting in a food shortage following the hurricane according to nicaraguan officials more than 2,500 homes 39 bridges and 40km  25mi  of road were destroyed by cesar in all the storm killed 42 people and left an estimated 100,000 homeless costa rica
