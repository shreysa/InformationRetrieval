temperature-dependency of the heats of vaporization for water methanol benzene and acetone 

the enthalpy of vaporization  symbol hvap  also known as the  latent  heat of vaporization or heat of evaporation is the amount of energy   that must be added to the liquid substance to transform a quantity of that substance into a gas the enthalpy of vaporization is a function of the  at which that transformation takes place the enthalpy of vaporization is often quoted for the  of the substance  although tabulated values are usually corrected to 298 that correction is often smaller than the  in the measured value the heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent though a constant heat of vaporization can be assumed for small temperature ranges and for   the heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at a certain point called the critical temperature   above the  the liquid and  phases are indistinguishable and the substance is called a

units 
values are usually quoted in   or kj mol  molar enthalpy of vaporization  although kj kg or j g  specific heat of vaporization  and older units like  mol cal g and  lb are sometimes still used among others enthalpy of condensation 
the enthalpy of condensation  or heat of condensation  is by definition equal to the enthalpy of vaporization with the opposite sign  enthalpy changes of vaporization are always positive  heat is absorbed by the substance  whereas enthalpy changes of condensation are always negative  heat is released by the substance  thermodynamic background 

the enthalpy of vaporization can be written as



it is equal to the increased  of the vapor phase compared with the liquid phase plus the work done against ambient pressure the increase in the internal energy can be viewed as the energy required to overcome the  in the liquid  or solid in the case of   hence  has a particularly low enthalpy of vaporization 0.0845kj mol as the  between helium  are particularly weak on the other hand the  in liquid  are held together by relatively strong  and its enthalpy of vaporization 40.65kj mol is more than five times the energy required to heat the same quantity of water from 0c to 100c   75.3jk1mol1  care must be taken however when using enthalpies of vaporization to measure the strength of intermolecular forces as these forces may persist to an extent in the gas phase  as is the case with   and so the calculated value of the  will be too low this is particularly true of metals which often form  molecules in the gas phase  in these cases the  must be used to obtain a true value of the  an alternative description is to view the enthalpy of condensation as the heat which must be released to the surroundings to compensate for the drop in  when a gas condenses to a liquid as the liquid and gas are in  at the boiling point  tb   0 which leads to 



as neither entropy nor  vary greatly with temperature it is normal to use the tabulated standard values without any correction for the difference in temperature from 298k a correction must be made if the  is different from 100 as the entropy of a gas is proportional to its pressure  or more precisely to its   the entropies of liquids vary little with pressure as the  of a liquid is small these two definitions are equivalent  the boiling point is the temperature at which the increased entropy of the gas phase overcomes the intermolecular forces as a given quantity of matter always has a higher entropy in the gas phase than in a condensed phase   is always positive  and from

 
the  change falls with increasing temperature  gases are favored at higher temperatures as is observed in practice vaporization enthalpy of electrolyte solutions 
estimation of the enthalpy of vaporization of electrolyte solutions can be simply carried out using equations based on the chemical thermodynamic models such as pitzer model or tcpc model selected values





the vaporization of metals is a key step in  which exploits the increased reactivity of metal atoms or small particles relative to the bulk elements other common substances
