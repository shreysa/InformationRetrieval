the polar highs are areas of high  around the  and   the north polar high being the stronger one because land gains and loses heat more effectively than sea the cold temperatures in the polar regions cause air to descend to create the high pressure  a process called   just as the warm temperatures around the  cause air to rise to create the low pressure  rising air also occurs along bands of low pressure situated just below the polar highs around the 50th parallels of latitude these extratropical convergence zones are occupied by the  where  of polar origin meet and clash with those of tropical or subtropical origin this convergence of rising air completes the vertical cycle around the  in each latitudinal hemisphere closely related to this concept is the  surface  under the polar highs are the coldest on earth with no month having an average temperature above freezing regions under the polar high also experience very low levels of  which leads them to be known as   air flows outwards from the poles to create the  in the  and  areas references
