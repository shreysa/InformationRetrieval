tropical cyclone observation has been carried out over the past couple of centuries in various ways the passage of typhoons hurricanes as well as other tropical cyclones have been detected by word of mouth from sailors recently coming to port or by radio transmissions from ships at sea from sediment deposits in near shore estuaries to the wiping out of cities near the coastline since  advances in technology have included using planes to survey the ocean basins satellites to monitor the world s oceans from  using a variety of methods radars to monitor their progress near the coastline and recently the introduction of  to penetrate storms recent studies have concentrated on studying hurricane impacts lying within rocks or near shore lake sediments which are branches of a new field known as  this article details the various methods employed in the creation of the hurricane database as well as reconstructions necessary for reanalysis of past storms used in projects such as the

recent studies of the  and  isotopes found in  in  show that tropical cyclone events can leave markers that can be separated out on a week-by-week basis the error rate of this type of microanalysis was 1 error in 1,200 sampling points markers in coral 
rocks contain certain isotopes of elements known as natural tracers which describe the conditions under which they formed by studying the calcium carbonate in coral rock past sea surface temperature and hurricane information can be revealed lighter oxygen isotopes  16o  are left behind in coral during periods of very heavy rainfall since hurricanes are the main source of extreme rainfall in the tropical oceans past hurricane events can be dated to the days of their impact on the coral by looking at the increased 18o concentration within the coral sediment deposition in coastal lakes 
kam biu-liu a professor at  has been studying sediment lying at the bottom of coastal lakes and marshes in order to study the frequency and intensity of hurricanes over the past 5,000years since storm surges sweep coastal sands with them as they progress inland a layer of sand is left behind in coastal lakes and marshes  is then used to date the layers newspapers 
before the invention of the  in the early to mid-19th century news was as fast as the quickest horse stage or ship normally there was no advance warning of a tropical cyclone impact however the situation changed in the 19th century as seafaring people and land-based researchers such as father vies in  came up with systematic methods of reading the sky s appearance or the sea state which could foretell a tropical cyclone s approach up to a couple days in advance in  the abundance of historical documentary records in the form of fang zhi  semiofficial local gazettes  offers an extraordinary opportunity for providing a high-resolution historical dataset for the frequency of typhoon strikes kam-biu liu et al  2001  reconstructed a 1,000-year time series of typhoon landfalls in the guangdong province of southern china since ad 975 and found that on a decadal timescale the twenty-year interval from ad 1660 to 1680 is the most active period on record with twenty-eight to thirty-seven typhoon landfalls per decade the variability in typhoon landfalls in guangdong mimics that observed in other paleoclimatic proxies  e.g tree rings ice cores  from china and the northern hemisphere remarkably the two periods of most frequent typhoon strikes in guangdong  ad 1660-1680 18501880  coincide with two of the coldest and driest periods in northern and central china during the  surface observations

ship reports 
for centuries people have sailed the world s oceans and seas and for just as long they have encountered storms the worst of the cyclones over the open seas likely took those that observed them into the depths of the oceans however some did survive to report harrowing tales before the invention of the wireless  in 1905 reports about storms at sea either coincided with their arrival at the coast as ships scrambled into port or came weeks and months afterwards from remote ports of call ship and buoy reports available since the 1970s are used in real-time not only for their temperature pressure and wind measurements but also for their sea surface temperature and wave height measurements wind reports from ships at sea have become increasingly based on anemometers and less so on the  this is important to note as the beaufort scale underestimates winds at higher wind speeds indicating ship wind observations taken for older storms are likely to underrepresent their true value as  et al point out many tropical cyclones that formed on the open sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s they estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 these undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones the density of shipping tracks over the atlantic basin and the amount of populated coastline land-based observations 
in the early 20th century forecasting the track of cyclones was still confined to areas of the greatest surface pressure falls based upon  and climatology these methods proved to be the cutting edge of tropical cyclone forecasting through the mid 20th century land-based surface observations remain invaluable as a source of real-time information at locations near the coastline and inland combined with ship observations and newspapers they formed the total information network for hurricane detection until radiosondes were introduced in 1941 and reconnaissance aircraft began in 1944 land-based observations of pressure and wind can show how quickly a tropical cyclone is decaying as it moves inland their rainfall reports show where significant rainfall is occurring and can be an alert for possible flooding with the establishment of the asos network in the  during the 1990s more locations are reporting around the clock than ever before mobile platforms 
since the 1990s academic researchers have begun to deploy mobile weather stations fortified to withstand hurricane-force winds the two largest programs are the florida coastal monitoring program and the wind engineering mobile instrumented tower experiment during landfall the noaa hurricane research division compares and verifies data from reconnaissance aircraft including wind speed data taken at flight level and from gps dropwindsondes and stepped-frequency microwave radiometers to wind speed data transmitted in real time from weather stations erected near or at the coast the national hurricane center uses the data to evaluate conditions at landfall and to verify forecasts upper air observations
