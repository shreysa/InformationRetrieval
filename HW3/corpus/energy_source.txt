energy development is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources these activities include production of conventional  and  sources of energy and for the  that would otherwise be wasted  and  reduce the demand for energy development and can have benefits to society with improvements to  societies use energy for transportation manufacturing illumination heating and air conditioning and communication for industrial commercial and domestic purposes energy resources may be classified as primary resources where the resource can be used in substantially its original form or as secondary resources where the energy source must be converted into a more conveniently usable form non-renewable resources are significantly depleted by human use whereas renewable resources are produced by ongoing processes that can sustain indefinite human exploitation thousands of people are employed in the  the conventional industry comprises the  the natural gas industry the  and the  new energy industries include the  comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture distribution and sale of

energy resources may be classified as primary resources suitable for end use without conversion to another form or secondary resources where the usable form of energy required substantial conversion from a primary source examples of primary energy resources are   wood fuel fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas and uranium secondary resources are those such as electricity  or other synthetic fuels another important classification is based on the time required to regenerate an energy resource  renewable  resources are those that recover their capacity in a time significant by human needs examples are hydroelectric power or wind power when the natural phenomena that are the primary source of energy are ongoing and not depleted by human demands non-renewable resources are those that are significantly depleted by human usage and that will not recover their potential significantly during human lifetimes an example of a non-renewable energy source is coal which does not form naturally at a rate that would support human use fossil fuels

the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject since there are diverging views on this topic and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source  typically have high capital costs for building the plant but low direct fuel costs in recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks in eastern europe a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania and some potential backers have pulled out where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects
