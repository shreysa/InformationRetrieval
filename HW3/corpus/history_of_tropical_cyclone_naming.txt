formal start of naming 




 was the pioneer in naming storms


the practice of using names to identify  goes back several centuries with systems named after places saints or things they hit before the formal start of naming in each basin examples include the 1526 san francisco hurricane the  and the  credit for the first usage of personal names for weather is generally given to the  meteorologist  who named named tropical cyclones and anticyclones between 18871907 wragge used names drawn from the letters of the greek alphabet greek and roman mythology and female names to describe weather systems over   and the  after the new  had failed to create a federal weather bureau and appoint him director wragge started naming cyclones after political figures this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of the  despite falling into disuse the naming scheme was occasionally mentioned in the press with an editorial published in the launceston examiner newspaper on october 5 1935 that called for the return of the naming scheme wragge s naming was also mentioned within sir s manual of meteorology which likened it to a  child naming waves  after reading about clement wragge  was inspired to write a novel   about a storm affecting  which was named maria the book was widely read after it was published in 1941 by  especially by  and   usn  meteorologists during  during 1944  forecasters  usaaf  at the newly established  weather center started to informally name typhoons after their wives and girlfriends this practise became popular amongst meteorologists from the united states airforce and navy who found that it reduced confusion during map discussions and in 1945 the united states armed services publicly adopted a list of women s names for typhoons of the pacific however they were not able to persuade the   uswb  to start naming atlantic hurricanes as the weather bureau wanted to be seen as a serious enterprise and thus felt that it was  not appropriate  to name tropical cyclones while warning the united states public they also felt that using women s names was frivolous and that using the names in official communications would have made them look silly during 1947 the air force hurricane office in miami started using the  to name significant tropical cyclones in the north atlantic ocean these names were used over the next few years in private internal communications between weather centres and aircraft and were not included in public bulletins 



 like other typhoons during  was informally assigned a code name


during august and september 1950 three tropical cyclones  hurricanes   and   occurred simultaneously and impacted the united states during august and september 1950 which led to confusion within the media and the public as a result during the next tropical cyclone    decided to start using the names in public statements and in the seasonal summary this practice continued throughout the season until the system was made official before the start of the  during 1952 a new  was introduced as the  was seen as too  this led to some confusion with what names were being used as some observers referred to  as  cocoa  ahead of the  no agreement could be reached over which phonetic alphabet to use before it was decided to start using a list of female names to name tropical cyclones during the season the names were used in the press with only a few objections recorded and as a result public reception to the idea seemed favourable the same names were reused during 1954 with only one change  gilda for gail however as hurricanes   and  affected the populated  controversy raged with several protests over the use of womens names as it was felt to be ungentlemanly or insulting to womanhood or both letters were subsequently received that overwhelmingly supported the practise with forecasters claiming that 99 of correspondence received in the miami weather bureau supported the use of womens names for hurricanes forecasters subsequently decided to continue with the current practice of naming hurricanes after women but developed a new set of names ahead of the  with the names carol edna and hazel retired for the next ten years however before the names could be written a tropical storm was discovered on january 2 1955 and named  the representative  subsequently announced that he intended to introduce legislation that would call on the uswb to abandon its practice of naming hurricanes after women and suggested that they be named using descriptive terms instead until 1960 forecasters decided to develop a new set of names each year by 1958 the guam weather center had become the fleet weather central typhoon tracking center on guam and had started to name systems as they became tropical storms rather than typhoons later that year during the 195859 cyclone season the new caledonia meteorological office started to name tropical cyclones within the southern pacific during 1959 the  and the  decided that the various us navy and air force weather units would become one unit based on  entitled the  which continued naming the systems for the pacific basin 19601990s 
in january 1960 a formal naming scheme was introduced for the south-west indian ocean by the mauritius and madagascan weather services with the first cyclone being named alix later that year as  entered a new era with the launching of the world s first   eight lists of tropical cyclone names were prepared for use in the  in the atlantic it was decided to rotate these lists every four years while in the eastern pacific the names were designed to be used consecutively before being repeated during 1963 the  adopted four sets of female filipino nicknames ending in  ng  from a to y for use in its self-defined  following the international practise of naming tropical cyclones the  decided at a conference in october 1963 that they would start naming tropical cyclones after women at the start of the  the first  cyclone was subsequently named bessie on january 6 1964 in 1965 after two of the eastern pacific lists of names had been used it was decided to start recycling the sets of names on an annual basis like in the atlantic at its 1969 national conference the  passed a motion that called for the   nhc  not to name tropical cyclones using only female names later that year during the  the   nzms  office in  started to name tropical cyclones that developed within the  with the first named alice on january 4 1970 within the atlantic basin the four lists of names were used until 1971 when the newly established united states  decided to inaugurate a ten-year list of names for the basin  subsequently petitioned the 1971 1972 and 1973 interdepartmental hurricane conferences to stop the female naming  however the  responded by stating that there was a 20 1 positive response to the usage of female names in february 1975 the nzms decided to incorporate male names into the naming lists for the south pacific from the following season after a request from the fiji national council of women who considered the practice discriminatory at around the same time the  ordered that tropical cyclones within the australian region should carry both men s and women s names as the minister thought  that both sexes should bear the odium of the devastation caused by cyclones  male names were subsequently added to the lists for the southern pacific and each of the three australian tropical cyclone warning centres ahead of the 197576 season during 1977 the  decided to form a hurricane committee which held its first meeting during may 1978 and took control of the  during 1978 the   ordered   to cease the sole usage of female names for hurricanes robert white subsequently passed the order on to the director of nhc  who attended the first meeting of the hurricane committee and requested that both mens and womens names be used for the atlantic the committee subsequently decided to accept the proposal and adopted five new lists of male and female names to be used the following year the lists also contained several spanish and french names so that they could reflect the cultures and languages used within the atlantic ocean after an agreement was reached between mexico and the united states six new sets of male female names were implemented for the eastern pacific basin during 1978 a new list was also drawn up during the year for the western pacific and was implemented after typhoon bess and the 1979 tropical cyclone conference as the dual sex naming of tropical cyclones started in the northern hemisphere the nzms considered adding ethnic pacific names to the naming lists rather than the european names that were currently used as a result of the many languages and cultures in the pacific there was a lot of discussion surrounding this matter with one name  oni  being dropped as it meant  the end of the world  in one language one proposal suggested that cyclones be named from the country nearest to which they formed  however this was dropped when it was realized that a cyclone might be less destructive in its formative stage than later in its development eventually it was decided to combine names from all over the south pacific into a single list at a training course where each course member provided a list of names that were short easily pronounced culturally acceptable throughout the pacific and did not contain any idiosyncrasies these names were then collated edited for suitability and cross-checked with the group for acceptability it was intended that the four lists of names should be alphabetical with alternating male and female names while using only ethnic names however it was not possible to complete the lists using only ethnic names as a result there was a scattering of european names in the final lists which have been used by the  and nzms since the  during october 1985 the eastern pacific hurricane center had to request an additional list after the names preselected for that season was used up as a result the names xina york zelda xavier yolanda zeke were subsequently added to the naming lists while a contingency plan of using the greek alphabet if all of the names were used up was introduced new millennium 
during the 30th session of the escap wmo typhoon committee in november 1997 a proposal was put forward by hong kong to give asian typhoons local names and to stop using the european and american names that had been used since 1945 the committee s training and research coordination group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session during august 1998 the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be followed for the selection of names it was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and that a single objection would be enough to veto a name a list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the typhoon committee s 32nd session who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on january 1 2000 it was also decided that the  would name the systems rather than the  during its annual session in 2000 the wmo escap panel on north indian tropical cyclones agreed in principle to start assigning names to  that developed within the north indian ocean as a result of this the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur by the end of 2000 at the 2001 session the rapporteur reported that of the eight countries involved only india had refused to submit a list of names as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones the panel then studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and thus requested that members submit new lists of names during 2002 the rapporteur reported that there had been a poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names over the next year each country except india submitted a fresh list by the 2004 session india had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so however the rapporteur presented the lists of names that would be used with a gap left for india s names the rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season starting in may or june 2004 the naming lists were then completed in may 2004 after india submitted their names however the lists were not used until september 2004 when the first tropical cyclone was named  by the   imd  



 unofficially received the name  catarina  from media outlets


at the 22nd hurricane committee in 2000 it was decided that tropical cyclones that moved from the atlantic to the eastern pacific basin and vice versa would no longer be renamed ahead of the  it was decided to start using male names as well as female names for tropical cyclones developing in the south-west indian ocean rsmc la reunion subsequently proposed to the fifteenth session of the ra i tropical cyclone committee for the south-west indian ocean during september 2001 that the basin adopt a single circular list of names along with the ra v tropical cyclone committee rsmc la reunion also proposed to the session that a tropical cyclone have only one name during its lifetime however both of these proposals were rejected in favour of continuing an annual list of names and to rename systems when they moved across 90e into the south-west indian ocean during the 2002 atlantic hurricane season the naming of  restarted with names assigned to systems from the main list of names drawn up for that year during march 2004 a rare tropical cyclone developed within the southern atlantic about 1,010km  630mi  to the east-southeast of florianpolis in southern brazil as the system was threatening the brazilian state of  a newspaper used the headline  furaco catarina  which was presumed to mean  furaco  hurricane  threatening  santa  catarina  the state  however when the international press started monitoring the system it was assumed that  furaco catarina  meant  cyclone catarina  and that it had been formally named in the usual way during the  the names pre-assigned for the north atlantic basin were exhausted and as a result names from the greek alphabet were used there were subsequently a couple of attempts to get rid of the greek names as they are seen to be inconsistent with the standard naming convention used for tropical cyclones and are generally unknown and confusing to the public however none of the attempts have succeeded and thus the greek alphabet will be used should the lists ever be used up again ahead of the  the   cphc  and the hawaii state civil defense requested that the hurricane committee retire eleven names from the eastern pacific naming lists however the committee declined the request and noted that its criteria for the retirement of names was  well defined and very strict  it was felt that while the systems may have had a significant impact on the hawaiian islands none of the impacts were major enough to warrant the retirement of the names it was also noted that the committee had previously not retired names for systems that had a greater impact than those that had been submitted the cphc also introduced a revised set of hawaiian names for the central pacific after they had worked with the   department to ensure the correct meaning and appropriate historical and cultural use of the names on april 22 2008 the newly established tropical cyclone warning centre in  named its first system   before two sets of indonesian names were established for their area of responsibility ahead of the  at the same time the australian bureau of meteorology merged their three lists into one national list of names the issue of tropical cyclones being renamed when they moved across 90e into the south-west indian ocean was subsequently brought up during october 2008 at the 18th session of the ra i tropical cyclone committee however it was decided to postpone the matter until the following committee meeting so that various consultations could take place during the 2009 tropical cyclone rsmcs tcwcs technical coordination meeting it was reaffirmed that a tropical cyclone name should be retained throughout a system s lifetime including when moving from one basin to another to avoid confusion as a result it was proposed at the following year s ra i tropical cyclone committee that systems stopped being renamed when they moved into the south-west indian ocean from the australian region it was subsequently agreed that during an interim period cyclones that moved into the basin would have a name attached to their existing name before it was stopped at the start of the 201213 season tropical cyclone bruce was subsequently the first tropical cyclone not to be renamed when it moved into the south-west indian ocean during 2013-14 during march 12 2010 public and private weather services in southern brazil decided to name a tropical storm anita in order to avoid confusion in future references a naming list was subsequently set up by the brazilian navy hydrographic center with the names arani bapo and cari subsequently taken from that list during 2011 and 2015 at its twenty-first session in 2015 the ra i tropical cyclone committee reviewed the arrangements for naming tropical storms and decided that the procedure was in need of a  very urgent change  in particular it was noted that the procedure did not take into account any of the significant improvements in the science surrounding tropical cyclones and that it was biased due to inappropriate links with some national warning systems as a result the committee decided to keep the current naming procedure for the next few years and form a task force in order to develop an alternative cyclone naming procedure the taskforce could not meet during the intersessional pierod but planned to meet during the twenty-second session during 2017 modern day 
main articles       and 



at present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven warning centres and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts watches and warnings due to the potential for longevity and multiple concurrent storms the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is being described names are assigned in order from predetermined  once storms have one three or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65km h  40mph  depending on which basin it originates in however standards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the western pacific while tropical cyclones have to have gale-force winds occurring near the center before they are named within the southern hemisphere any member of the  s hurricane typhoon and tropical cyclone committees can request that the name of a tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various  a name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the tropical cyclone has acquired a special notoriety such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage impacts or for other special reasons any tropical cyclone names assigned by the papua new guinea national weather service are automatically retired regardless of any damage caused a replacement name is then submitted to the committee concerned and voted upon but these names can be rejected and replaced for various reasons these reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name its similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social media pagasa also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones when they have caused at least 70091000000000000001billion in damage and or have caused at least 300deaths there are no names retired within the south-west indian ocean as names that are used are automatically removed from the three naming lists used in that basin see also
