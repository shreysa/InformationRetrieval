a mild snowstorm 

a winter storm is an event in which varieties of  are formed that only occur at low  such as  or  or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are low enough to allow  to form  i.e   in temperate continental  these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well very rarely they may form in summer though it would have to be an abnormally cold summer such as the summer of  in the northeast

snowstorms are storms where large amounts of snow fall two inches  5cm  of snow is enough to create serious disruptions to  and school transport  because of the difficulty to drive and maneuver the school buses on slick roads  this is particularly true in places where snowfall is not typical but heavy accumulating snowfalls can occur in places where snowfall is typical such small snowfalls are rarely disruptive because of effective snow and ice removal by municipalities increased use of  and  and drivers being more used to winter conditions snowfalls in excess of 6 inches  15cm  are usually universally disruptive a massive snowstorm with strong winds and other conditions meeting certain criteria is known as a  a large number of heavy snowstorms some of which were blizzards occurred in the  during  and  as well as the early and mid-1990s the snowfall of 1947 exceeded 2 feet  61cm  with drifts and snow piles from plowing that reached 12 feet  3.7m  and for months temperatures did not rise high enough to melt the snow the  manifested as a blizzard in most of the affected areas large snowstorms could be quite dangerous  a 6in  15cm  snowstorm will make some unplowed roads impassable and it is possible for  to get stuck in the snow snowstorms exceeding 12in  30cm  especially in southern or generally warm climates will cave the  of some homes and cause the loss of electricity standing dead trees can also be brought down by the weight of the snow especially if it is wet or very dense even a few inches of dry snow can form drifts many feet high under windy conditions dangers of snow 
accumulating snow can make driving motor vehicles very hazardous accumulation of snow on roadways reduces friction between tires and the pavement which in turn lowers the maneuverability of a vehicle considerably as a result average driving speeds on public roads and highways are reduced by up to 40 while heavy snow is falling visibilities are reduced by falling snow and this is further exacerbated by strong winds which are commonly associated with winter storms producing heavy snowfall in  this may lead to prolonged  conditions in which visibilities are reduced to only a few feet due to falling or blowing snow these hazards can manifest even after snowfall has ended when strong winds are present as these winds will pick up and transport fallen snow back onto roadways and reduce visibilities in the process this can even result in  if winds are strong enough  heavy snowfall can immobilize a vehicle entirely which may be deadly depending on how long it takes rescue crews to arrive the clogging of a vehicle s tailpipe by snow may lead to  buildup inside the cabin depending on the temperature profile in the atmosphere snow can be either wet or dry dry snow being lighter is transported by wind more easily and accumulates more efficiently wet snow is heavier due to the increased water content significant accumulations of heavy wet snow can cause roof damage it also requires considerably more energy to move and this can create health problems while shoveling when combined with the harsh weather conditions numerous deaths as a result of heart attacks can be attributed to snow removal accretion of wet snow to elevated surfaces occurs when snow is  sticky  enough which can cause extensive tree and power line damage in a manner similar to ice accretion during ice storms power can be lost for days during a major winter storm and this usually means the loss of heating inside buildings other than the obvious risk of hypothermia due to cold exposure another deadly element associated with snowstorms is  which can happen anytime combustion products from generators or heating appliances are not properly vented finally partially or fully melted snow on roadways can refreeze when temperatures fall creating  a sudden rise in air temperature is can result in the rapid melting of snow this can create flooding issues if the snowpack has sufficient water content and this can be significantly exacerbated by heavy rainfall and by  which may have formed on area rivers during prolonged subfreezing temperatures the re-freezing of previously melted snow creates  in roadways this process is accelerated when water is melted and re-frozen multiple times fog is also known to occur during rapid melting of snow  and  occur when significant amounts of snow falls on mountains freezing rain

heavy showers of  are one of the most dangerous types of winter storm they typically occur when a layer of warm air hovers over a region but the ambient temperature a few meters above the ground is near or below 0c  32f  and the ground temperature is sub-freezing while a 10cm  3.9in  snowstorm is somewhat manageable by the standards of the northern  and  a comparable 10mm  0.39in  ice storm can paralyze a region  driving becomes extremely hazardous telephone and power lines are damaged and crops may be ruined 
notable ice storms include anrelated  that affected much of eastern canada including  and  as well as upstate  and part of  three million people lost power some for as long as six weeks one-third of the trees in montreal s  park were damaged as well as a large proportion of theproducing  trees the amount of economic damage caused by the storm has been estimated at  3 billion  the christmas day ice storm of 2000 caused devastating electrical issues in parts of   and  the city of  experienced the worst damage at one point losing the ability to use telephones power and running water in some areas in arkansas oklahoma texas and eventually  over an inch of ice accumulated from the freezing rain the  in  resulted in massive power loss throughout much of the state and property damage due to falling trees except in the mountainous western part of the state heavy snow and icy conditions are rare in  the  was another severe winter storm producing extensive ice damage across a large portion of the southern united states on december 14 to 16 it led to power outages and at least 7 deaths in january 2005  had been declared a major disaster zone by president  after an ice storm caused nearly  39 million in damages to thirty-two counties federal funds were provided to the counties during january 46 2005 to aid the recovery process the  was a crippling and historic ice storm most places struck by the storm saw 2 inches  51mm  or more of ice accumulation and a few inches of snow on top of it this brought down power lines causing some people to go without power for a few days to a few weeks in some cases some didn t see power for a month or more at the height of the storm more than 2 million people were without power graupel

ice crystals fall through a cloud of super-cooled dropletsminute cloud droplets that have fallen below freezing temperature but have not frozen the ice crystal plows into the super-cooled droplets and they immediately freeze to it this process forms graupel or snow pellets as the droplet continues to accumulate on the crystal the pellets bounce when they hit the ground ice pellets 
main article  
out ahead of the passage of a warm front falling snow may partially melt and refreeze into a frozen rain drop before it reaches the ground these ice pellets are called sleet in most of the  because it is easily seen and does not accumulate ice it is not as dangerous as freezing rain rime

rime is a milky white accumulation of super-cooled cloud or fog droplets that freeze when they strike an object that has a temperature of 32f  0c  the freezing point of water the process is called riming when super-cooled cloud droplets attach to ice crystals in the formation of  rime ice can pose a hazard to an airliner when it forms on a wing as an aircraft flies through a cloud of super-cooled droplets see also
