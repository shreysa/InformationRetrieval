preparations 
in the days prior to hitting  david was originally expected to hit  and spare  in the process however on august 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150mph  240km h  hurricane to make a direct hit on the southern part of dominica even as it became increasingly clear that david was headed for the island residents did not appear to take the situation seriously this can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent furthermore dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930 thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population this proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation some 400,000people evacuated in the united states in anticipation of david including 300,000 in southeastern florida due to a predicted landfall between the  and  of those 78,000 fled to shelters while others either stayed at a friend s house further inland or traveled northward making landfall during labor day weekend david forced the cancellations of many activities in the greater miami area impact
