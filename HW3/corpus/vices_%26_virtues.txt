background 
material for a follow-up to  dates back to at least april 2008 just one month after the release of the record former guitarist and primary songwriter ryan ross told  the band had  nine or ten new songs going right now  which picked up in the same direction of pretty odd  it was pretty much the same with the last record  bassist jon walker said  we haven t stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about    it s sounding  pretty awesome  which is probably what we re going to call the next record  ross joked  we ve got quite a few new ideas and songs we ve been working on and we re hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year  the article explained that walker said the band would be taking time off for the holidays and then re-entering the studio to record new music in june 2009 singer brendon urie revealed the band had been writing for  roughly half a year now  at ross   home and continued to take the band  further down the sun-dappled retro-pop path  began exploring on pretty odd   we ve always been a pop band we ve always been fans of pop music whether it s   which is like the beginning of pop music  we ve always been fans of good catchy melodies and lighthearted music  spencer smith drummer added  we moved to california since the last record so that s inspiration we started surfing too so maybe we ll get a little  vibe on this one  during this time smith moved in with urie while ross began writing his own material with walker at his home on july 6 2009 ryan ross and jon walker announced via the band s official website that the two were leaving the band the statement in part read   ryan ross and jon walker will be leaving panic at the disco to embark on a musical excursion of their own though the four of us have made music together in the past weve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve over the years we have remained close and honest with each other which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us  in an interview following the split ross explained that he first brought the idea to smith in late june 2009 over lunch   spencer and i had lunch and caught up for a while and then the big question came up like  well what do you want to do  and i said  well i think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while  and he said  i m glad you said that because i was going to say the same thing    ross recalled  and there was really no argument which is really the best way that could ve worked out  ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and urie urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound while ross  and by extension walker  was interested in making retro-inspired rock the news asserted that both tour plans with  in august 2009 and new album production  will continue as previously announced  and the announcement ended with the teaser for a  surprise  soon to come the following day  broke the news that   the first song recorded without ross and walker debuted the following month on radio and as a part of the soundtrack to the film   new perspective  was recorded in spring 2009 when the band had just moved out to topanga smith explained the song was inspired by the band s new experiences when there   we re living near the ocean and going surfing every day which we ve never done before we tried to get that out in the song i guess  the band reinserted the exclamation mark into its name a few days after the departure of ross and walker recording and production 
the writing and recording process for vices   virtues took much longer than the band intended the band was  very confused  after the split from ross and walker desiring instead to go on tour to understand better as evidenced above  oh glory  and  new perspective  were largely recorded during the summer of 2009 with producer   these songs are just brendon and i having fun because that s what we want to do  smith told mtv news shortly after the departure of ross and walker smith revealed the band was recording   we re working on an album now that hopefully takes the best parts from both of our records  because we love them both and are really proud of them  while on the  smith showed blink-182 singer bassist  several demos for the album in hopes that he would produce a song or two hoppus confirmed in august 2009 that he was committed to producing one  really strong  track on the record as well as possible others if allowed during this time urie told news outlets the band had  about 10 songs  ready to consider for the band s third album in the beginning stages a song featuring  of  whom urie later described as  super nice  was set to appear on the new album but the song is absent from the final track listing the band initially planned to record the album in fall 2009 to be released the beginning of 2010 however recording did not begin until april 2010 friend and pretty odd producer  was  like family  to smith and urie inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo s initial beginning he encouraged them to love the work they do and   just get out of bed in the morning dont loathe the things that you actually love doing because its just going to keep you down  for which urie recalled the band  owed a lot  for after working with the demos produced during the summer with feldmann for several months afterward the duo decided they weren t satisfactory so the band started over with new material the biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band with urie and smith writing everything the album was produced by feldmann and  urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers but instead regarded feldmann and walker s input positively regarding their help as  hey this is your record i want to help you with your ideas so you bring me the ideas and well help you do that i dont want to write anything for you this is your record it has to be your voice  the band continued working with feldmann for four months in early 2010 later going to walker to finalize and improve the songs on may 7 2010 the band posted a batch of photos during recording sessions for vices   virtues all guitars and bass for the album were completed by early july and by the end of the month urie confirmed that recording of the album was complete and mixing would follow soon near the end of the writing process the band looked back upon the lyrics and noticed that  some of the motion was pining for something or some of it was vanity or some of it touched on subversion or overthrowing of somebody or manipulation  urie likened it to the  and after research settled on the title vices   virtues  in the biblical sense there s all that stuff and then theres just morals that we live by every day and human behavior  urie said  i guess this record was really a study in human behaviormostly for us personally what we had been going through and noticing all of that 
music 




the duo performing on the first show of the  in new york city february 1 2011 

musically vices   virtues has been described as      and  the album features a variety of different musical styles in its tracks as a testament to the amount of time of production each song  sounds different from the next  according to urie in the beginning the band had no direction for music or lyrics however after returning to the studio and restarting production the band became excited to start with a second chance  we ve been working on music for about a year and a half so i think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles  smith said  part of it was us at the beginning trying to figure out what we wanted to do  we had a new opportunity with just the two of us  and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was just kind of went from there  the duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was you get all the work done record the song arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadnt used before  the band s musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an  to record synthesizers on the record the band got to work with french band the  and a children s choir on the track  nearly witches  ever since we met 
a majority of the band s previous material was written by former guitarist ryan ross for vices   virtues urie had  to step up and take the reins lyrically  which he regarded as having not much experience in prior the biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out instead of locking themselves in and writing urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling urie explained  we were so self-conscious about everything hyper-aware of what were doing that when were writing i go  okay i dont want this to be s   but i want it to be as romantic and cute  theres a lot of that fighting within yourself but it ended up being great and im glad that we were able to figure out what we wanted to write about  the lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of ross and walker the sessions with feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds  we really loved  and got into using marimbas and string instruments  explains urie  we ended up buying some synths and messing around with them it was two kids in a candy store and we listened to  s  on repeat for me for the past well since it came out  
  has been described by alternative press as   the upbeat pop energy of  with the focus and clarity of pretty odd  urie has explained that he and smith desired to achieve a sound that is more similar to the former   we missed a couple things from our first record in terms of sonically with these little instruments that we hadnt really used on our second record there  a lot of organic instruments and not a lot of electronics or synthesizers so we wanted to get back to some of that  smith agreed and stated  i think there s stuff from the first album that we kind of got away from on the second record that people who were fans of the first one will enjoy   the calendar  originally written about an  between a male and a female soon began to resemble the friendships in former members ross and walker  the song was finished as a direct response to their departure from the group  sarah smiles  was written for urie s wife  sarah smiles  is about my girlfriend actually as sappy as that is  he told spin in 2011  when i met her i wrote this song to try and impress her i was infatuated with her i played it for her and we ve been dating ever since that was a huge step for me personally   nearly witches  ever since we met  was rejected for inclusion on pretty odd due it not fitting within the concept of the album  urie and smith finished the song for vices   virtues promotion 
the album s title and other early information was announced in alternative press in its december 2010 issue  it set the album for a march 2011 release  with the first single tentatively titled  mona lisa  due out in january 2011  the band did a promotional vices   virtues photoshoot with designer anthony franco on the january 8 2011 on january 18 the band revealed via a post on their website that the record would be released on march 29 2011 and on january 25 the cover art was revealed a behind the scenes video of the photoshoot revealed that  a touring only member at the time featured on the album cover masked and standing in the background behind smith and urie on february 15 2011 responding to eager public demand the release date for vices   virtues was moved up to march 22 by the band the first single   was released on february 1 2011 the music video for the single was released february 8 2011 and entered heavy rotation across the  the single received positive reviews many noting the similarity in sound to a fever you can t sweat out the deluxe edition of the album includes the demo  oh glory  which was initially released via the band s official website in july 2009 as a 30-second sample like pretty odd vices   virtues received heavy popularity through online music stores  by february 2011 the record was already up to the top five overall on the  top albums  chart promotion for vices   virtues included an appearance on  a week after the record s release on march 28 and  a week after that on april 4 2011 in promotion of the record smith and urie filmed a short film to accompany the album titled the overture directed by shane drake the film was released on march 9 2011 and contains several musical snippets from the record the nearly seven-minute mini-film features urie and smith with a score of actors ranging from identical twins to a  couple the film is filled with symbolism regarding the departure of ross and walker and the process of moving on without them in march 2011 the band began streaming the album in its entirety  with the exception of bonus tracks  from the official panic  at the disco facebook page along with an accompanying introductory video from urie and smith release 
vices   virtues was released march 18 2011 in the united states brazil and canada as well as multiple other dates for other countries the record debuted at number seven on the us  chart with first-week sales of 56,000 copies in the united states this is in stark contrast to the group s previous effort pretty odd which debuted in 2008 with first-week sales of 139,000 the album also came in second on  s alternative albums chart and fifth on the digital albums ranking as of january 2016 it has sold 194,000 copies in the united states reception

negative criticism for the album mostly came regarding the inexperienced lyrcism of urie william goodman of  criticized urie s lyrics of the album  the result is verbose and generic diary-entry romance  but praised the musical experimentation remarking  vices   virtues s saving grace though is the varied instrumentation      and digital atmospherics   of  concurred with goodman and also focused positive opinion upon the arrangements of the album recommending  nearly witches  and calling the album  emo retropop  commenting  it s the closest emo has come to the sound of old-school pop and rock with beach boys harmonies and even gypsy-style swing flavoring the usual hopped-up confessions  mikael wood of entertainment weekly agreed with these sentiments recommending  the ballad of mona-lisa  and the  harmony-drenched   sarah smiles  vices   virtues tour
