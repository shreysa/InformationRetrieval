geographic features and biological importance 
the coastline of the gulf of maine is predominantly rocky and scenic  the only significant coastal developments are located in the    and  metropolitan areas the effects of glaciation are responsible for stripping sedimentary soil away from the coastline therefore the gulf lacks the sandy beaches found to the south along the  the underwater features of the seabed sculptured during the lower sea levels of the  make the gulf a semi-enclosed sea bounded to the south and east by underwater banks  in particular on its southern end protects the gulf of maine waters from the  gulf of maine waters are more strongly influenced by the  making the gulf waters significantly colder and more nutrient-rich than those found to the south undersea valleys in the central basin can reach depths of 1,500 feet  500 m  while undersea mountains rise up 800 feet  266 m  from the sea floor almost reaching the surface in some locations or even exceeding it creating islands 



major features of the gulf of maine


there are three major basins contained within the gulf of maine  wilkinson basin to the west jordan basin in the northeast and georges basin in the south which are isolated from each other beneath the 650 foot  200 m   georges basin just north of georges bank is the deepest of the three at just over 1200 feet  370 m  and generates a pocket at the end of the northeast channel a deep fissure between georges bank and browns bank the southwestern edge of the nova  the northeast channel is the major channel between the gulf and the rest of the northwest atlantic a secondary shallower connection to the rest of the atlantic is the great south channel located between georges bank and the  shoals due to rapid warming of the gulf of maine the water has become too hot for cod this along with past overfishing has helped pushed stocks towards collapse and hampered its recovery despite deep reductions in the number of fish caught according to a study conducted by the gulf of maine research institute traditional calculations  consistently over-estimated the abundance of cod  from 2004 temperatures rose by more than 0.4 degrees f  0.1 degrees c  per year culminating in an ocean heat wave in the northwest atlantic in 2012-13 gulf of maine watershed
