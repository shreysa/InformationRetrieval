the 2006 pacific typhoon season was a near-average season that produced a total of 23 named storms 15 typhoons and six super typhoons the season ran throughout 2006 though most tropical cyclones typically  between may and october the season s first named storm  developed on may 9 while the season s last named storm trami dissipated on december 20 this season was also much active costly and deadly than the  throughout the season many typhoons made landfall at a higher intensity  was the most powerful typhoon to strike  for over 50 years as a category 4 typhoon responsible for over 400 deaths  struck  and became the costliest typhoon this season with a total damage of about  2.5 billion the  got hit by a total of six typhoons which saw the highest number since  all six typhoons were responsible for over 1,000 casualties and several millions of damages  which formed from the  entered the basin and became the strongest central pacific hurricane moreover it was stated that the ratio of intense typhoons was 0.73 which was the highest since  the scope of this article is limited to the pacific ocean to the north of the equator between  and  within the northwestern pacific ocean there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names the  jma  will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute  of at least 65km h  40mph  anywhere in the basin whilst the  pagasa  assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135e and 115e and between 5n25n regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the jma tropical depressions that are monitored by the united states   jtwc  are given a number with a  w  suffix

seasonal forecasts 

during the year several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones tropical storms and typhoons will form during a season and or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country these agencies included the tropical storm risk tsr  consortium of   and taiwan s  some of the forecasts took into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the la nia conditions that were observed during the previous year on march 7 tropical storm risk issued its first forecast for the season at an extended-range forecasting a close to average season of 27 tropical storms 17 typhoons and 8 intense typhoons the ace predicted was around 298 by may 5 tropical storm risk issued their second forecast for the season raising their numbers to 29 tropical storms 19 typhoons and 9 intense typhoons with an ace of 326 this is due to the observed warming of sea-surface temperatures in the nio 3.75 region and current patterns within the central pacific indicating slightly higher activity tsr released its third forecast for the season on june 7 predicting the same numbers with the same reason though on their fourth forecast during july 5 tsr stated that the 2006 season will be 15 above the 19652005 norm therefore they raised the number of intense typhoons to 10 and their ace to 349 the other reason behind this is due to the fact that there was an increase in tropical activity and much warmer ssts over in the nio 3.75 region than the previous forecast on august 4 tsr released their final forecast they reduced the number of intense typhoons to 9 and the ace to 325 this was because it was reported that a slight decrease in tropical activity from the previous forecast and is due solely of a slight decrease in ssts over in the same region
