a study of line overhead in the arpanet the form extent and effect of the communication line overhead in the arpanet are considered the source of this over head is separated into various levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics of each level are summarized then the line efficiency for various models of system use is studied some measurements of line efficiency for the arpanet are presented and by extrapolation these measurements are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network similar results are derived for a recently proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system cacm January, 1976 Kleinrock, L.
