the first hurricane warning service was set up in the 1870s from  with the work of father benito vies after his death hurricane warning services were assumed by the  and  over the next decade first based in  in 1898 and  in 1899 before shifting to  in 1902 the central office in washington which evolved into the national meteorological center and weather prediction center  formally known as the hydrometeorological prediction center  assumed hurricane warning advisory responsibility at that time this responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935 and the concept of the atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time the jacksonville hurricane warning office moved to  in 1943 tropical cyclone naming began for atlantic tropical cyclones using the  by 1947 in 1950 the miami hurricane warning office began to prepare the annual hurricane season summary articles in the  the united states weather bureau began naming storms which reach tropical storm intensity with human names

the  begun in the 1950s used aircraft to study tropical cyclones and carry out experiments on mature hurricanes through its  on july 1 1956 a national hurricane information center was established in miami florida which became a warehouse for all hurricane-related information from one united states weather bureau office the miami hurricane warning office  hwo  moved from lindsey hopkins hotel to the aviation building 4 miles  6.4km  to the northwest on july 1 1958 forecasts within the hurricane advisories were issued one day into the future in 1954 before being extended to two days into the future in 1961 three days into the future in 1964 and five days into the future in 2001 the miami hwo moved to the campus of the  in 1964 and was referred to as the nhc in 1965 the miami hwo tropical cyclone reports were done regularly and took on their modern format in 1964 as the national hurricane center 

beginning in 1973 the national meteorological center duties  renamed the hydrometeorological prediction center  renamed for a second time in 2013  gained advisory responsibility for tracking and publicizing inland tropical depressions the  assumed control of the atlantic hurricane naming list in 1977 in 1978 the nhc s offices moved off the campus of the university of miami across  to the ire financial building male names were added into the hurricane list beginning in the  the hurricane warning offices remained active past 1983 in 1984 the nhc was separated from the miami weather service forecast office which meant the meteorologist in charge at miami was no longer in a position above the hurricane center director by 1988 the nhc gained responsibility for eastern pacific tropical cyclones as the former  in san francisco was decommissioned in 1992  blew the  weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of nhc s the miami state weather forecast offices the radar was replaced with a wsr-88d  system in april 1993 installed near  near where hurricane andrew made landfall in 1995 the nhc moved into a new hurricane-resistant facility on the campus of  capable of withstanding 130mph  210km h  winds its name was changed to the tropical prediction center in 1995 after the name change to tpc the hurricane specialists were grouped as a separate nhc unit under the tropical prediction center separating themselves from the tropical analysis and forecast branch on october 1 2010 the tropical prediction center was renamed the nhc and the group formerly known as the nhc became known as the hurricane specialists unit  hsu  tropical cyclone forecasting is now done using statistical methods based on tropical cyclone climatology as well as methods of  where computers use mathematical equations of motion to determine their movement the world meteorological organization continues to create and maintain the annual hurricane naming lists naming lists use a six-year rotation with the deadliest or most notable storm names retired from the rotation the current acting director of the national hurricane center is edward rappaport following the retirement of  on may15 2017 a permanent replacement director has not been announced organization 
for the  of 2008 the budget for the nhc was  6.8million a total of 66people work for the nhc with 12 of the staff composing their management the nhc has been one of the nine national centers which compose the national centers for environmental prediction  ncep  hurricane specialists unit 




the hsu operations area comprises four desks  pictured  from which the tropics are monitored


known as the nhc from 1995 through 2010 the hurricane specialists within the hurricane specialists unit  hsu  are the chief meteorologists that predict the actions of tropical storms the specialists work rotating eight-hour shifts from may through november monitoring weather patterns in the atlantic and eastern pacific oceans whenever a tropical or subtropical cyclone forms they issue advisories every six hours until the storm is over public advisories are issued more often when the storm expected to be of tropical storm or hurricane intensity threatens land the specialists coordinate with officials in each country likely to be affected they forecast and recommend watches and warnings during the hurricane season the hsu routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season the hsu issues special tropical weather outlooks backup responsibility for their northeast pacific area resides at the central pacific hurricane center  cphc  and vice versa if cphc were to have communication issues north atlantic responsibilities are backed up by the weather prediction center  wpc  routine coordination occurs at 1700 utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future outside of the hurricane season the specialists concentrate on public education efforts

the tropical analysis and forecast branch  tafb formerly the tropical satellite analysis and forecast unit and the tropical analysis center  is a part of the national hurricane center and was created in 1967 the tafb is responsible for  analyses and forecasts for tropical portions of the atlantic and pacific between the  and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern atlantic ocean unlike the hurricane specialists unit  hsu  tafb is staffed full-time around the year other responsibilities of the tafb include satellite-derived  position and  estimates  fixes for tropical cyclones tropical cyclone forecast support media support and general operational support the ocean prediction center backs up tafb in the event of a communications outage and vice versa technology and science branch 
the technology   science branch  tsb  develops and transitions new tools and techniques into operations for tropical weather prediction in conjunction with other government and academic entities tsb created and continues development of the  used to incorporate various data and model outputs create and update  and to generate tropical cyclone forecasts the tsb provides support for nhc computer and communications systems including its website tsb maintains a number of statistical and dynamical models used in predicting both tropical cyclone behavior and associated weather conditions the  unit which develops and maintains software to forecast the storm surge of tropical cyclones is part of this branch the techniques development and applications unit  tdau  is part of tsb carcah
