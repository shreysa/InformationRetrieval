locations of tropical climates with subtypes 
   


a tropical climate in the  is a non climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures of at least 18c  64f  in  climates there are often only two seasons  a wet season and a dry season tropical climates are frost-free and changes in the solar angle are small in tropical climates temperature remains relatively constant  hot  throughout the year

sub types 
within the tropical climate zone there are distinct varieties based on precipitation 
tropical rain forest climate 
main article  
all 12 months have average precipitation of at least 60mm  2.4in  these climates usually occur within 10 latitude of the  this climate is dominated by the  low-pressure system all year round so has no natural seasons in terms of thermal and moisture changes cities featuring a tropical rainforest climate





some of the places with this climate are indeed uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year  e.g the northwest  coast of  and  from  to   see for instance    but in many cases the period of higher sun and longer days is distinctly wettest  as at    or the time of lower sun and shorter days may have more rain  as at     note the term  refers to the lack in the tropical zone of large differences in daylight hours and mean monthly  or daily  temperature throughout the year annual cyclic changes occur in the tropics but not as predictably as those in the temperate zone albeit unrelated to temperature but to water availability whether as rain mist soil or ground water plant response  e g   animal  feeding migration reproduction etc  and human activities  plant sowing harvesting hunting fishing etc  are tuned to this  seasonality  indeed in tropical south america and central america the  rainy season   and the  high water season  is called  or inverno though it could occur in the northern hemisphere summer  likewise the  dry season   and  low water season  is called  or vero and can occur in the northern hemisphere winter  tropical monsoon climate 
main article  
this type of climate results from the  winds which change direction according to the seasons this climate has a driest month  which nearly always occurs at or soon after the  winter  solstice for that side of the equator  with rainfall less than 60mm but more than 1 25 the total annual precipitation 2001 208

tropical wet and dry or savanna climate

aw climates have a pronounced dry season with the driest month having precipitation less than 60mm and less than 1 25 of the total annual precipitation 20811
examples





most places that have this climate are found at the outer margins of the  zone from the low teens to the mid-20s latitudes but occasionally an inner-tropical location  e.g    also qualifies actually the  coast eastward from the  on the  border to the  delta on the   about 4,000km  have long dry periods  the extreme is the bsh climate  see below  characterised by very low unreliable precipitation present for instance in extensive areas in the  and  western  the northernmost peninsulas in south america which receive  300mm total annual precipitation practically all in two or three months  this condition extends to the  and  forming the circum-caribbean dry belt the length and severity of the dry season diminishes inland  southward  at the latitude of the amazon riverwhich flows eastward just south of the the climate is af east from the  between the dry arid caribbean and the ever-wet amazon are the orinoco river s  or  from where this climate takes its name sometimes as is used in place of aw if the dry season occurs during the time of higher sun and longer days this is the case in parts of  northwestern dominican republic      east africa   kenya     and brazilian northeastern coast    and   for instance in most places that have tropical wet and dry climates however the dry season occurs during the time of lower sun and shorter days because of  effects during the  high-sun  part of the year exceptions 
owing to different causes certain places within the tropics do not have a tropical climate such as some desert areas and alpine regions 
examples 

southern part of  the  alpine regions of the tropics mountaintops within the tropics e.g  can be cold however like lowlands in the tropics  and unlike cold winter  regions  there is little seasonal variation of temperature

because of the  most areas within the tropics are hot year-round with diurnal variations in temperature exceeding seasonal variations seasonal variations in tropical climate are dominated by changes in precipitation which are in turn largely influenced by the  or   itcz  a portion of the  the itcz is shown for july average in the graphic areas of ascending air have heavy rainfall  areas of descending air are dry the itcz somewhat follows the solar equator throughout the year but with geographical variations and in some areas  india  is heavily influenced by local large-scale  see also
