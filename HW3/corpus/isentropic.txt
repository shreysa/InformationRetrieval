in  an isentropic process is an idealized  that is both  and  the work transfers of the system are frictionless and there is no transfer of heat or matter such an idealized process is useful in engineering as a model of and basis of comparison for real processes the word  isentropic  is occasionally though not customarily interpreted in another way reading it as if its meaning were deducible from its etymology this is contrary to its original and customarily used definition in this occasional reading it means a process in which the entropy of the system remains unchanged for example because work done on the system includes friction internal to the system and heat is withdrawn from the system in just the right amount to compensate for the internal friction so as to leave the entropy unchanged

the entropy of a given mass does not change during a process that is internally reversible and adiabatic a process during which the entropy remains constant is called an isentropic process written  or   some examples of theoretically isentropic thermodynamic devices are     and  isentropic efficiencies of steady-flow devices in thermodynamic systems 
most steady-flow devices operate under adiabatic conditions and the ideal process for these devices is the isentropic process.the parameter that describes how efficiently a device approximates a corresponding isentropic device is called isentropic or adiabatic efficiency isentropic efficiency of turbines

note  the isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles real cycles have inherent losses due to compressor and turbine inefficiencies and the second law of thermodynamics real systems are not truly isentropic but isentropic behavior is an adequate approximation for many calculation purposes isentropic flow 
in fluid dynamics an isentropic flow is a  that is both adiabatic and reversible that is no heat is added to the flow and no energy transformations occur due to  or  for an isentropic flow of a perfect gas several relations can be derived to define the pressure density and temperature along a streamline note that energy can be exchanged with the flow in an isentropic transformation as long as it doesn t happen as heat exchange an example of such an exchange would be an isentropic expansion or compression that entails work done on or by the flow for an isentropic flow entropy density can vary between different streamlines if the entropy density is the same everywhere then the flow is said to be  derivation of the isentropic relations 
for a closed system the total change in energy of a system is the sum of the work done and the heat added 


the reversible work done on a system by changing the volume is
