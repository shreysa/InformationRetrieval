a hybrid frontal-lake effect snowsquall hitting toronto canada during rush hour 

a snowsquall  or snow squall  is a sudden moderately heavy  fall with  and strong gusty surface  it is often referred to as a  and is similar to a  but is localized in  or in  and snow accumulations may or may not be significant

types 
there are two primary types of snowsqualls lake effect and frontal lake-effect snow

when arctic air moves over large expanses of warmer open waters in winter  clouds develop which cause heavy snow showers due to the large amount of moisture available this occurs southwest of extratropical cyclones with the curved cyclonic wind flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm  which then leads to narrow lake-effect snow bands that can produce significant localized snowfall  conditions will affect narrow corridors from shores to inland areas aligned along the  direction this will be enhanced when the moving air mass is  by higher elevations the name originates from the  area of  however any body of water can produce them regions in  of  such as the canadian  could experience such snowsqualls the areas affected by lake-effect snow are called  and deposition rate of many    of snow per hour are common in these situations in order for lake-effect snow to form the  difference between the water and 850  should be at least 23f  13c  surface temperature be around the freezing mark the lake unfrozen the path over the lake at least 100km and the directional  with height should be less than 30 from the surface to 850 millibars extremely cold air over still warm water in early winter can even produce  snow showers accompanied by  and  
frontal snowsquall 




frontal snowsquall moving toward  united states


a frontal snowsquall is an intense frontal  line  similar to a   when  is near freezing at the surface the strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow this type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front in situations where there are other contributing factors such as  from a deepening low pressure system or a series of  lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage in situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles  40 kilometers  with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart this is similar to a line of thunderstorms in the summer but the tops of the clouds are only 5,000 to 10,000 feet  1,500 to 3,000 m  often difficult to see on radar forecasting these types of events is equivalent to summer severe weather forecast for squall lines  presence of a sharp frontal trough with wind shift and low level jet of more than 30 knots  55.58km h  however the cold dome behind the trough is at 850 mbar instead of a higher level and must be at least13f 25c  the presence of surface moisture from bodies of water or preexisting liquid precipitation is also a significant contributing factor helping to raise the dew point temperature and saturate the boundary layer this saturate can significantly increase the amount of convective available potential energy leading to deeper vertical growth and higher precipitable water levels increasing the volume of snow which can be produced by the squall in cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed  
dangers 




rapidly deteriorating weather conditions during snowsqualls often lead to traffic accidents 

both types of snowsqualls are very dangerous for  and  or generally any  unfortunate enough to get stuck in one the change in conditions is very sudden and slippery conditions and abrupt loss of visibility due to  often cause  in the case of lake effect snow heavy amounts of snow can accumulate in short periods of time possibly causing road closures and paralyzing cities for instance on january 9 2015 a localized heavy snow squall caused a 193-vehicle pile-up on i-94 highway near galesburg michigan see also
