tnt equivalent is a convention for expressing energy typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion the  ton of tnt  is a  defined by that convention to be 4.184  which is the approximate energy released in the  of a   1,000 kilograms or one megagram  of  the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional  of which tnt is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as  contain more energy

kiloton and megaton 
the  kiloton  of   is a unit of energy equal to 4.184  the  megaton  of tnt  is a unit of energy equal to 4.184  the kiloton and megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a  the tnt equivalent appears in various  and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an  historical derivation of the value 
a gram of  releases 26736702j   upon explosion the energy liberated by one gram of tnt was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184j which is exactly one  an explosive s energy is normally expressed as the  produced by its detonation which for tnt has been accurately measured as 4686j g from a large sample of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 4853j g the measured pure  output of a gram of tnt is only 2724j  but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculations alternative tnt equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared a kiloton of tnt can be visualized as a cube of tnt 8.46 metres  27.8ft  on a side

relative effectiveness factor 
the relative effectiveness factor  re factor  relates an explosive s demolition power to that of tnt in units of the tnt equivalent kg  tnte kg  the re factor is the relative mass of tnt to which an explosive is equivalent  the greater the re the more powerful the explosive this enables engineers to determine the proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for tnt for example if a timber-cutting formula calls for a charge of 1kg of tnt then based on  s re factor of 2.38 it would take only 1.0 2.38  or 0.42  kg of it to do the same job using  engineers would need 1.0 1.66  or 0.60  kg to obtain the same effects as 1kg of tnt with  or  they would require 1.0 0.74  or 1.35  kg or 1.0 0.42  or 2.38  kg respectively re factor examples 

  tbx  thermobaric explosives  or ebx  enhanced blast explosives  in a small confined space may have over twice the power of destruction the total power of aluminized mixtures strictly depends on the condition of explosions nuclear examples
