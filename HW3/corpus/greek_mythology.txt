greek mythology is known today primarily from  and representations on visual media dating from the  from c 900800 bc onward in fact literary and archaeological sources integrate sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict  however in many cases the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots literary sources
mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of greek literature nevertheless the only general mythographical handbook to survive from greek antiquity was the  of pseudo-apollodorus this work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional greek mythology and heroic legends  lived from c 180125 bc and wrote on many of these topics his writings may have formed the basis for the collection  however the  library  discusses events that occurred long after his death hence the name pseudo-apollodorus

greek mythology has changed over time to accommodate the evolution of their culture of which mythology both overtly and in its unspoken assumptions is an index of the changes in greek mythology s surviving literary forms as found mostly at the end of the progressive changes it is inherently political as gilbert cuthbertson has argued the earlier inhabitants of the  were an agricultural people who using  assigned a spirit to every aspect of nature eventually these vague spirits assumed human forms and entered the local mythology as gods when tribes from the north of the balkan peninsula invaded they brought with them a new  of gods based on conquest force prowess in battle and violent heroism other older gods of the agricultural world fused with those of the more powerful invaders or else faded into insignificance after the middle of the archaic period myths about relationships between male gods and male heroes became more and more frequent indicating the parallel development of   eros paidikos    thought to have been introduced around 630 bc by the end of the fifth century bc poets had assigned at least one  an adolescent boy who was their sexual companion to every important  except  and to many legendary figures previously existing myths such as those of  and  also then were cast in a  alexandrian poets at first then more generally literary mythographers in the early roman empire often re-adapted stories of greek mythological characters in this fashion the achievement of epic poetry was to create story-cycles and as a result to develop a new sense of mythological chronology thus greek mythology unfolds as a phase in the development of the world and of humans while self-contradictions in these stories make an absolute timeline impossible an approximate chronology may be discerned the resulting mythological  history of the world  may be divided into three or four broader periods 

the myths of origin or age of gods  theogonies  births of gods  myths about the origins of the world the gods and the human race the age when gods and mortals mingled freely  stories of the early interactions between gods  and mortals the age of heroes  heroic age  where divine activity was more limited the last and greatest of the heroic legends is the story of the trojan war and after  which is regarded by some researchers as a separate fourth period  
while the age of gods often has been of more interest to contemporary students of myth the greek authors of the archaic and classical eras had a clear preference for the age of heroes establishing a chronology and record of human accomplishments after the questions of how the world came into being were explained for example the heroic iliad and odyssey dwarfed the divine-focused theogony and homeric hymns in both size and popularity under the influence of homer the  hero cult  leads to a restructuring in spiritual life expressed in the separation of the realm of the gods from the realm of the dead  heroes  of the  from the olympian in the works and days hesiod makes use of a scheme of four   or races  golden silver bronze and iron these races or ages are separate creations of the gods the  belonging to the reign of cronos the subsequent races to the creation of  the presence of evil was explained by the myth of  when all of the best of human capabilities save hope had been spilled out of her overturned jar in  ovid follows hesiod s concept of the four ages origins of the world and the gods

according to classical-era mythology after the overthrow of the titans the new  of  and  was confirmed among the principal greek gods were the olympians residing on  under the eye of zeus  the limitation of their number to twelve seems to have been a comparatively modern idea  besides the olympians the greeks worshipped various gods of the countryside the satyr-god    spirits of rivers    who dwelled in springs    who were spirits of the trees    who inhabited the sea  river gods  and others in addition there were the dark powers of the underworld such as the   or furies  said to pursue those guilty of crimes against blood-relatives in order to honor the ancient greek pantheon poets composed the homeric hymns  a group of thirty-three songs   regards  the larger homeric hymns as simple preludes  compared with theogony  each of which invokes one god  the gods of greek mythology are described as having essentially corporeal but ideal bodies according to  the defining characteristic of greek anthropomorphism is that  the greek gods are persons not abstractions ideas or concepts  regardless of their underlying forms the ancient greek gods have many fantastic abilities  most significantly the gods are not affected by disease and can be wounded only under highly unusual circumstances the greeks considered immortality as the distinctive characteristic of their gods  this immortality as well as unfading youth was insured by the constant use of  and  by which the divine blood was renewed in their veins each god descends from his or her own genealogy pursues differing interests has a certain area of expertise and is governed by a unique personality  however these descriptions arise from a multiplicity of archaic local variants which do not always agree with one another when these gods are called upon in poetry prayer or cult they are referred to by a combination of their name and  that identify them by these distinctions from other manifestations of themselves  e.g apollo musagetes is    leader of the   alternatively the epithet may identify a particular and localized aspect of the god sometimes thought to be already ancient during the classical epoch of greece most gods were associated with specific aspects of life for example  was the goddess of love and beauty  was the god of war  the ruler of the underworld and  the goddess of wisdom and courage some gods such as  and  revealed complex personalities and mixtures of functions while others such as   literally  hearth  and   literally  sun  were little more than personifications the most impressive  tended to be dedicated to a limited number of gods who were the focus of large pan-hellenic cults it was however common for individual regions and villages to devote their own cults to minor gods many cities also honored the more well-known gods with unusual local rites and associated strange myths with them that were unknown elsewhere during the heroic age the cult of heroes  or demi-gods  supplemented that of the gods age of gods and mortals
bridging the age when gods lived alone and the age when divine interference in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together these were the early days of the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later most of these tales were later told by ovid s  and they are often divided into two thematic groups  tales of love and tales of punishment

tales of love often involve incest or the seduction or rape of a mortal woman by a male god resulting in heroic offspring the stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid  even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings in a few cases a female divinity mates with a mortal man as in the homeric hymn to aphrodite where the goddess lies with  to produce  the second type  tales of punishment  involves the appropriation or invention of some important cultural artifact as when  steals fire from the gods when  steals nectar and  from zeus  table and gives it to his own subjectsrevealing to them the secrets of the gods when  or  invents sacrifice when  teaches agriculture and the  to  or when  invents the  and enters into a musical contest with  ian morris considers prometheus  adventures as  a place between the history of the gods and that of man  an anonymous papyrus fragment dated to the third century vividly portrays   punishment of the king of   whose recognition of the new god came too late resulting in horrific penalties that extended into the afterlife the story of the arrival of dionysus to establish his cult in thrace was also the subject of an aeschylean trilogy in another tragedy euripides   the king of   is punished by dionysus because he disrespected the god and spied on his  the female  of the god

the age in which the heroes lived is known as the  the epic and genealogical poetry created cycles of stories clustered around particular heroes or events and established the family relationships between the heroes of different stories  they thus arranged the stories in sequence according to   there is even a saga effect  we can follow the fates of some families in successive generations  after the rise of the hero cult gods and heroes constitute the sacral sphere and are invoked together in oaths and prayers which are addressed to them burkert notes that  the roster of heroes again in contrast to the gods is never given fixed and final form great gods are no longer born but new heroes can always be raised up from the army of the dead  another important difference between the hero cult and the cult of gods is that the hero becomes the centre of local group identity the monumental events of heracles are regarded as the dawn of the age of heroes to the heroic age are also ascribed three great events  the  expedition the  and the  heracles and the heracleidae

some scholars believe that behind heracles  complicated mythology there was probably a real man perhaps a chieftain-vassal of the kingdom of  some scholars suggest the story of heracles is an allegory for the sun s yearly passage through the twelve constellations of the zodiac others point to earlier myths from other cultures showing the story of heracles as a local adaptation of hero myths already well established traditionally heracles was the son of zeus and  granddaughter of  his fantastic solitary exploits with their many  themes provided much material for popular legend according to burkert  he is portrayed as a sacrificer mentioned as a founder of altars and imagined as a voracious eater himself  it is in this role that he appears in comedy while his tragic end provided much material for tragedy   is regarded by thalia papadopoulou as  a play of great significance in examination of other euripidean dramas  in art and literature heracles was represented as an enormously strong man of moderate height  his characteristic weapon was the bow but frequently also the club vase paintings demonstrate the unparalleled popularity of heracles his fight with the lion being depicted many hundreds of times heracles also entered etruscan and roman mythology and cult and the exclamation  mehercule  became as familiar to the romans as  herakleis  was to the greeks in italy he was worshipped as a god of merchants and traders although others also prayed to him for his characteristic gifts of good luck or rescue from danger heracles attained the highest social prestige through his appointment as official ancestor of the  kings this probably served as a legitimation for the dorian migrations into the   the eponymous hero of one dorian  became the son of heracles and one of the heracleidae or heraclids  the numerous descendants of heracles especially the descendants of   other heracleidae included  lamos    and   these heraclids conquered the  kingdoms of   and  claiming according to legend a right to rule them through their ancestor their rise to dominance is frequently called the   the lydian and later the macedonian kings as rulers of the same rank also became heracleidae other members of this earliest generation of heroes such as perseus   and  have many traits in common with heracles like him their exploits are solitary fantastic and border on  as they slay monsters such as the  and  bellerophon s adventures are commonplace types similar to the adventures of heracles and theseus sending a hero to his presumed death is also a recurrent theme of this early heroic tradition used in the cases of perseus and bellerophon argonauts

greek and roman conceptions of myth
mythology was at the heart of everyday life in ancient greece greeks regarded mythology as a part of their history they used myth to explain natural phenomena cultural variations traditional enmities and friendships it was a source of pride to be able to trace the descent of one s leaders from a mythological hero or a god few ever doubted that there was truth behind the account of the trojan war in the iliad and odyssey according to  a military historian columnist political essayist and former  professor and john heath a classics professor the profound knowledge of the homeric  was deemed by the greeks the basis of their acculturation homer was the  education of greece      and his poetry  the book  philosophy and myth




 s plato in  fresco  probably in the likeness of   the philosopher expelled the study of homer of the tragedies and of the related mythological traditions from his utopian republic 

after the rise of philosophy history prose and  in the late 5th century bc the fate of myth became uncertain and mythological genealogies gave place to a conception of history which tried to exclude the supernatural  such as the  history  while poets and dramatists were reworking the myths greek historians and philosophers were beginning to criticize them a few radical philosophers like  of colophon were already beginning to label the poets  tales as blasphemous lies in the 6th century bc  xenophanes had complained that homer and hesiod attributed to the gods  all that is shameful and disgraceful among men  they steal commit adultery and deceive one another  this line of thought found its most sweeping expression in  s  and  plato created his own allegorical myths  such as the vision of er in the republic  attacked the traditional tales of the gods  tricks thefts and adulteries as immoral and objected to their central role in literature plato s criticism was the first serious challenge to the homeric mythological tradition referring to the myths as  old wives  chatter  for his part aristotle criticized the pre-socratic quasi-mythical philosophical approach and underscored that  hesiod and the theological writers were concerned only with what seemed plausible to themselves and had no respect for us  but it is not worth taking seriously writers who show off in the mythical style  as for those who do proceed by proving their assertions we must cross-examine them  nevertheless even plato did not manage to wean himself and his society from the influence of myth  his own characterization for  is based on the traditional homeric and tragic patterns used by the philosopher to praise the righteous life of his teacher 

but perhaps someone might say   are you then not ashamed socrates of having followed such a pursuit that you are now in danger of being put to death as a result  but i should make to him a just reply   you do not speak well sir if you think a man in whom there is even a little merit ought to consider danger of life or death and not rather regard this only when he does things whether the things he does are right or wrong and the acts of a good or a bad man for according to your argument all the demigods would be bad who died at troy including the son of  who so despised danger in comparison with enduring any disgrace that when his mother  and she was a goddess  said to him as he was eager to slay  something like this i believe 
my son if you avenge the death of your friend  and kill hector you yourself shall die  for straightway after hector is death appointed unto you  hom il 18.96 

he when he heard this made light of death and danger and feared much more to live as a coward and not to avenge his friends and said 
straightway may i die after doing vengeance upon the wrongdoer that i may not stay here jeered at beside the curved ships a burden of the earth 

hanson and heath estimate that plato s rejection of the homeric tradition was not favorably received by the grassroots greek civilization the old myths were kept alive in local cults  they continued to influence poetry and to form the main subject of painting and sculpture more sportingly the 5th century bc  euripides often played with the old traditions mocking them and through the voice of his characters injecting notes of doubt yet the subjects of his plays were taken without exception from myth many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor s version of the same or similar myth euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by   the gods as traditionally represented are far too crassly  hellenistic and roman rationalism




 saw himself as the defender of the established order despite his personal skepticism with regard to myth and his inclination towards more philosophical conceptions of divinity 

during the  mythology took on the prestige of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class at the same time the skeptical turn of the classical age became even more pronounced greek mythographer  established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events although his original work  sacred scriptures  is lost much is known about it from what is recorded by diodorus and  rationalizing  of myth became even more popular under the  thanks to the physicalist theories of  and  philosophy stoics presented explanations of the gods and heroes as physical phenomena while the euhemerists rationalized them as historical figures at the same time the stoics and the  promoted the moral significations of the mythological tradition often based on greek etymologies through his epicurean message  had sought to expel superstitious fears from the minds of his fellow-citizens  too is skeptical about the mythological tradition and claims that he does not intend to pass judgement on such legends  fabulae  the challenge for romans with a strong and apologetic sense of  was to defend that tradition while conceding that it was often a breeding-ground for superstition the antiquarian  who regarded religion as a human institution with great importance for the preservation of good in society devoted rigorous study to the origins of religious cults in his antiquitates rerum divinarum  which has not survived but  s  indicates its general approach  varro argues that whereas the superstitious man fears the gods the truly religious person venerates them as parents according to varro there have been three accounts of deities in the roman society  the mythical account created by poets for theatre and entertainment the civil account used by people for veneration as well as by the city and the natural account created by the philosophers the best state is adds varro where the civil theology combines the poetic mythical account with the philosopher s roman academic cotta ridicules both literal and allegorical acceptance of myth declaring roundly that myths have no place in philosophy  is also generally disdainful of myth but like varro he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions it is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended cicero asserts that no one  not even old women and boys  is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of hades or the existence of   or other composite creatures but on the other hand the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people de natura deorum is the most comprehensive summary of cicero s line of thought syncretizing trends

in  times a new roman mythology was born through syncretization of numerous greek and other foreign gods this occurred because the romans had little  of their own and inheritance of the greek mythological tradition caused the major roman gods to adopt characteristics of their greek equivalents the gods  and  are an example of this mythological overlap in addition to the combination of the two mythological traditions the association of the romans with eastern religions led to further syncretizations for instance the cult of sun was introduced in rome after  s successful campaigns in  the asiatic divinities   that is to say the sun  and ba al were combined with apollo and helios into one  with conglomerated rites and compound attributes apollo might be increasingly identified in religion with helios or even dionysus but texts retelling his myths seldom reflected such developments the traditional literary mythology was increasingly dissociated from actual religious practice the worship of sol as special protector of the emperors and of the empire remained the chief imperial religion until it was replaced by christianity the surviving 2nd-century collection of   second century ad  and the saturnalia of   fifth century  are influenced by the theories of rationalism and the syncretizing trends as well the orphic hymns are a set of pre-classical poetic compositions attributed to orpheus himself the subject of a renowned myth in reality these poems were probably composed by several different poets and contain a rich set of clues about prehistoric european mythology the stated purpose of the saturnalia is to transmit the hellenic culture macrobius has derived from his reading even though much of his treatment of gods is colored by egyptian and north african mythology and theology  which also affect the interpretation of virgil  in saturnalia reappear mythographical comments influenced by the euhemerists the stoics and the neoplatonists modern interpretations
