description
the thermal wind is the change in the amplitude or sign of the  due to a horizontal temperature gradient the  is an idealized wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension whenever the earth s rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics as in the mid-latitudes a balance between the  and the  develops intuitively a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill however the coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right  in the northern hemisphere  this is illustrated in panel  a  of the figure below the balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the horizontal pressure difference or pressure gradient in addition when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical  and the   occurs 



the geostrophic wind on different isobaric levels in a barotropic atmosphere  a  and in a baroclinic atmosphere  b  the blue portion of the surface denotes a cold region while the orange portion denotes a warm region this temperature structure is restricted to the surface in  a  but extends through the depth of the fluid in  b  the dotted lines enclose isobaric surfaces which remain at constant slope with increasing height in  a  and increase in slope with height in  b  pink arrows illustrate the direction and amplitude of the horizontal wind only in the baroclinic atmosphere  b  do these vary with height such variation illustrates the thermal wind 

in a  atmosphere where density is a function only of pressure a horizontal pressure gradient will drive a geostrophic wind that is constant with height however if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along isobars the isobars will be thicker this causes the slope of the isobars to increase with height this is illustrated in panel  b  of the figure to the left because isobars are steeper at higher elevations the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there however the coriolis force is the same so the resulting geostrophic wind at higher elevations must be greater in the direction of the pressure force in a  atmosphere where density is a function of both pressure and temperature such horizontal temperature gradients can exist the difference in horizontal wind speed with height that results is a vertical wind shear traditionally called the thermal wind mathematical formalism 
the geopotential thickness of an atmospheric layer is described by the  
 where  is the specific  for air  is the  at pressure level  and  is the vertically-averaged temperature of the layer this formula shows that the layer thickness is proportional to the temperature when there is a horizontal temperature gradient the thickness of the layer would be greatest where the temperature is greatest differentiating the geostrophic wind   where  is the   is the vertical unit vector and the subscript  p  on the gradient operator denotes gradient on a constant pressure surface  with respect to pressure and integrate from pressure level  to  we obtain the thermal wind equation 
 substituting the hypsometric equation one gets a form based on temperature  note that thermal wind is at right angles to the horizontal temperature gradient counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere the change in sign of  flips the direction examples




in  a  cold advection is occurring so the thermal wind causes the geostrophic wind to rotate counterclockwise  for the northern hemisphere  with height in  b  warm advection is occurring so the geostrophic wind rotates clockwise with height 

if a component of the geostrophic wind is parallel to the temperature gradient the thermal wind will cause the geostrophic wind to rotate with height if geostrophic wind blows from cold air to warm air  cold   the geostrophic wind will turn  with height  for the northern hemisphere  a  known as wind backing otherwise if geostrophic wind blows from warm air to cold air  warm advection  the wind will turn  with height also known as wind veering wind backing and veering allow an estimation of the horizontal temperature gradient with data from an  frontogenesis 
as in the case of advection turning when there is a cross component of the geostrophic wind a sharpening of the temperature gradient results thermal wind causes a deformation field and  may occur jet stream 
a horizontal temperature gradient exists while moving  along a  because curvature of the earth allows for more  at the  than at the poles this creates a  geostrophic wind pattern to form in the mid-latitudes because thermal wind causes an increase in wind  with height the westerly pattern increases in intensity up until the  creating a strong wind current known as the  the  and  exhibit similar jet stream patterns in the mid-latitudes the strongest part of jet streams should be in proximity where temperature gradients are the largest due to land masses in the northern hemisphere largest temperature contrasts are observed on the east coast of north america  boundary between canadian cold air mass and the gulf stream warmer atlantic  and eurasia  boundary between the boreal winter monsoon siberian cold air mass and the warm pacific  therefore the strongest boreal winter jet streams are observed over east coast of north america and eurasia since stronger vertical shear promotes  the most rapid development of   so called   is also observed along the east coast of north america and eurasia the lack of land masses in the southern hemisphere leads to a more constant jet with longitude  i.e a more zonally symmetric jet  references
