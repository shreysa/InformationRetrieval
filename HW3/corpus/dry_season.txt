the dry season is a yearly period of low rainfall especially in the  the weather in the tropics is dominated by the  which moves from the northern to the southern tropics and back over the course of the year the tropical rain belt lies in the southern hemisphere roughly from october to march  during that time the northern tropics have a dry season with sparser  and days are typically sunny throughout from april to september the rain belt lies in the northern hemisphere and the southern tropics have their dry season under the  for  a dry season month is defined as a month when average precipitation is below 60 millimetres  2.4in  the dry season has low humidity and some watering holes and rivers dry up this lack of water  and hence of food  may force many grazing animals to migrate to more fertile spots examples of such animals are   and  because of the lack of water in the plants bushfires are common data shows that in africa the start of the dry season coincides with a rise in the cases of which researchers believe might be attributed to the higher concentration of people in the dry season as agricultural operations are all but impossible without irrigation during this time some farmers move into cities creating hubs of higher population density and allowing disease to spread more easily the rain belt reaches roughly as far north as the  and as far south as the  near these latitudes there is one wet season and one dry season annually at the  there are two wet and two dry seasons as the rain belt passes over twice a year once moving north and once moving south between the tropics and the equator locations may experience a short wet and a long wet season  and a short dry and a long dry season local geography may substantially modify these climate patterns however new data shows that in the seasonal parts of the   foliage growth and coverage varies between the dry and wet seasonswith about 25 more leaves and faster growth in the dry season researchers believe that the amazon itself has an effect in bringing  the onset of the wet season  by growing more foliage it evaporates more water however this growth appears only in the undisturbed parts of the amazon basin where researchers believe roots can reach deeper and gather more rain water it has also been shown that  levels are much higher in the dry than in the wet season in the amazon basin references
