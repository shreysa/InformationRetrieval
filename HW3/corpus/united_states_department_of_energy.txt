budget 
president  unveiled on may 7 2009 a  26.4 billion budget request for doe for fiscal year  fy  2010 including  2.3 billion for the doe   eere  the budget aims to substantially expand the use of  sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure it also makes significant investments  in  and  in  technologies and in scientific research and innovation as part of the  789 billion economic stimulus package in the  of 2009 congress provided energy with an additional  38.3 billion for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 adding about 75 percent to energy s annual budgets most of the stimulus spending was in the form of grants and contracts  for fiscal year 2013 each of the operating units of the department of energy operated with the following budgets 

programs and contracts
main article  
energy savings performance contracts  espcs  are contracts under which a contractor designs constructs and obtains the necessary financing for an energy savings project and the federal agency makes payments over time to the contractor from the savings in the agency s utility bills the contractor guarantees the energy improvements will generate savings and after the contract ends all continuing cost savings accrue to the federal agency energy innovation hubs 
energy innovation hubs are  meant to advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages of research to the point that the risk level will be low enough for industry to commercialize the technologies the consortium for advanced simulation of light water reactors  casl  was the first doe energy innovation hub established in july 2010 for the purpose of providing advanced modeling and simulation  m s  solutions for commercial nuclear reactors 
the 2009 doe budget includes  280 million to fund eight energy innovation hubs each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge two of the eight hubs are included in the  budget and will focus on integrating smart materials designs and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity another two hubs included in the doe office of science budget were created to tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes yet another hub was made to develop  smart  materials to allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions in 2012 the doe awarded  120 million to the  to start a new eih the critical materials institute which will focus on improving the supply of  which is controlled by china advanced research projects agency-energy
