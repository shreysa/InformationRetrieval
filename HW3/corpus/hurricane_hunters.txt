a   weather reconnaissance aircraft



 hunters are aircrews that fly into  in the north  and northeastern  to gather weather data currently the us organizations that fly these missions are the  s  and the  s  such missions have also been flown by navy units and other air force and noaa units manned flights into hurricanes began in 1943 when on a bet pilot-trainer colonel joseph duckworth flew a single-engine plane into a category 1 storm near  texas since then six military weather reconnaissance planes have gone down at a cost of fifty-three lives in one such incident six of the seven crew members of the navy pb4y-2  buno 59415  were killed on october 1 1945 when their plane went down in a category 1 typhoon over the  before  were used to find storms military aircraft flew routine weather reconnaissance tracks to detect formation of tropical cyclones today satellites have improved weather forecasters  ability to detect signs of such cyclones before they form yet they cannot determine the interior  of a hurricane nor provide accurate wind speed information--data needed to accurately predict hurricane development and movement

among the types of aircraft that have been used to investigate hurricanes are an instrumented  flown in  during the  other types include the  1944   19441945   19451947   19461947   19461947 w 19511956  w 19561963  w 19631969  wn 19541973  a,b,e,h 19652012 the idea of aircraft reconnaissance of hurricane storm trackers was put forth by captain w l farnsworth of the galveston commercial association in the early 1930s supported by the  the  storm patrol bill  passed both the  and  on june 15 1936 1943 surprise hurricane 
the  which struck  during  marked the first intentional meteorological flight into a hurricane it started with a bet that summer british pilots were being trained in instrument flying at  when they saw that the americans were evacuating their  trainers in the face of the storm they began questioning the construction of the aircraft lead instructor   took one of the trainers out and flew it straight into the eye of the storm after he returned safely with  lt ralph o hair the base s weather officer lt william jones-burdick took over the navigator s seat and duckworth flew into the storm a second time this flight showed that hurricane reconnaissance flights were possible and further flights continued occasionally in 1946 the moniker  hurricane hunters  was first used and the air force and now air force reserve have used it ever since vw-4

the  s vw-4   wearecoron four weather reconnaissance squadron four  hurricane hunters  was the seventh u.s navy squadron dedicated to weather reconnaissance they flew several types of aircraft but the  was the aircraft most often associated with flying into the  eye of the storm  the squadron operated wc-121s between late 1954 and 1972 vw-4 lost one aircraft and crew in a penetration of  and another to severe damage in a storm but the severely damaged willy victor  mh-1  brought her crew home though it never flew again during 19731975 vw-4 operated the turbine-propeller  swan 38

a  series featuring the usafr 53d entitled hurricane hunters debuted on  in july 2012 see also
