airborne pulse-doppler radar antenna


a pulse-doppler radar is a  system that determines the range to a target using pulse-timing techniques and uses the  of the returned signal to determine the target object s velocity it combines the features of pulse radars and  which were formerly separate due to the complexity of the  pulse-doppler systems were first widely used on  starting in the 1960s earlier radars had used pulse-timing in order to determine range and the angle of the antenna  or similar means  to determine the bearing however this only worked when the radar antenna was not pointed down  in that case the reflection off the ground overwhelmed any returns from other objects as the ground moves at the same speed but opposite direction of the aircraft doppler techniques allow the ground return to be filtered out revealing aircraft and vehicles this gives pulse-doppler radars   capability a secondary advantage in military radar is to reduce the transmitted power while achieving acceptable performance for improved safety of stealthy radar pulse-doppler techniques also find widespread use in  allowing the radar to determine  from the velocity of any precipitation in the air pulse-doppler radar is also the basis of  used in   and mapping in air traffic control they are used for discriminating aircraft from clutter besides the above conventional surveillance applications pulse-doppler radar has been successfully applied in healthcare such as fall risk assessment and fall detection for nursing or clinical purposes

history 
the earliest radar systems failed to operate as expected the reason was traced to doppler effects that degrade performance of systems not designed to account for moving objects fast-moving objects cause a phase-shift on the transmit pulse that can produce signal cancellation doppler has maximum detrimental effect on  systems which must use reverse phase shift for doppler compensation in the detector doppler weather effects  precipitation  were also found to degrade  and moving target indicator radar which can mask aircraft reflections this phenomenon was adapted for use with  in the 1950s after declassification of some world war ii systems pulse-doppler radar was developed during world war ii to overcome limitations by increasing  this required the development of the  the  and solid state devices pulse-doppler is incompatible with other high power microwave amplification devices that are not  early examples of military systems include the b developed during the 1950s specifically for the purpose of operating in hurricane conditions with no performance degradation the  was a prototype airborne radar combination system for the planned  interceptor aircraft for the united states air force and later for the  the us s first pulse-doppler radar the system had  capability and could track one target at a time     and  are common tactics used to hide aircraft from radar pulse-doppler radar eliminates these weaknesses it became possible to use pulse-doppler radar on aircraft after digital computers were incorporated in the design pulse-doppler provided  capability to support air-to-air missile systems in most modern military aircraft by the mid 1970s principle 




principle of pulse-doppler radar


range measurement 




principle of pulsed radar


pulse-doppler systems measure the range to objects by measuring the elapsed time between sending a pulse of radio energy and receiving a reflection of the object radio waves travel at the  so the distance to the object is the elapsed time multiplied by the speed of light divided by two  there and back velocity measurement 




change of wavelength caused by motion of the source


pulse-doppler radar is based on the  where movement in range produces frequency shift on the signal reflected from the target 


 is essential for pulse-doppler radar operation as the reflector moves between each transmit pulse the returned signal has a  difference or phase shift from pulse to pulse this causes the reflector to produce doppler modulation on the reflected signal pulse-doppler radars exploit this phenomenon to improve performance the amplitude of the successively returning pulse from the same scanned volume is 



where



so



this allows the radar to separate the reflections from multiple objects located in the same volume of space by separating the objects using a spread  to segregate different signals 
 where  is the phase shift induced by range motion 
benefits 
rejection speed is selectable on pulse-doppler aircraft-detection systems so nothing below that speed will be detected a one degree antenna beam illuminates millions of square feet of terrain at 10 miles  16km  range and this produces thousands of detections at or below the horizon if doppler is not used pulse-doppler radar uses the following signal processing criteria to exclude unwanted signals from slow-moving objects this is also known as clutter rejection rejection velocity is usually set just above the prevailing wind speed  10 to 100 mile hour or 15 to 150km hour  the velocity threshold is much lower for  


in airborne pulse-doppler radar the velocity threshold is offset by the speed of the aircraft relative to the ground 



where  is the angle offset between the antenna position and the aircraft flight trajectory 
surface reflections appear in almost all radar ground clutter generally appears in a circular region within a radius of about 25 miles near ground-based radar this distance extends much further in airborne and space radar clutter results from radio energy being reflected from the earth s surface buildings and vegetation clutter includes weather in radar intended to detect and report aircraft and spacecraft clutter creates a vulnerability region in  non-doppler radar systems cannot be pointed directly at the ground due to excessive false alarms which overwhelm computers and operators sensitivity must be reduced near clutter to avoid overload this vulnerability begins in the low-elevation region several beam widths above the horizon and extends downward this also exists throughout the volume of moving air associated with weather phenomenon pulse-doppler radar corrects this as follows 
allows the radar antenna to be pointed directly at the ground without overwhelming the computer and without reducing sensitivity fills in the vulnerability region associated with  for small object detection near terrain and weather increases detection range by 300 or more in comparison to   mti  by improving sub-clutter visibility 
 of about 60db is needed for  capability and pulse-doppler is the only strategy that can satisfy this requirement this eliminates vulnerabilities associated with the low-elevation and below-horizon environment  and   mti  provide up to 25db sub-clutter visibility mti antenna beam is aimed above horizon to avoid excessive false alarm rate which renders systems vulnerable aircraft and some missiles exploit this weakness using a technique called flying below the radar to avoid detection   this flying technique is ineffective against pulse-doppler radar pulse-doppler provides an advantage when attempting to detect missiles and  flying near terrain sea surface and weather audible doppler and target size support passive vehicle type classification when  is not available from a  medium   prf  reflected microwave signals fall between 1,500 and 15,000 cycle per second which is audible this means a  sounds like a helicopter a  sounds like a jet and  sound like propellers  produce a tone the actual size of the target can be calculated using the audible signal 



maximum range from reflectivity  red  and unambiguous doppler velocity range  blue  with a fix pulse repetition rate 

ambiguity processing is required when target range is above the red line in the graphic which increases scan time scan time is a critical factor for some systems because vehicles moving at or above the speed of sound can travel one mile  1.6km  every few seconds like the    and  the maximum time to scan the entire volume of the sky must be on the order of a dozen seconds or less for systems operating in that environment pulse-doppler radar by itself can be too slow to cover the entire volume of space above the horizon unless fan beam is used this approach is used with the an sps 49 v 5 very long range air surveillance radar which sacrifices elevation measurement to gain speed pulse-doppler antenna motion must be slow enough so that all the return signals from at least 3 different prf can be processed out to the maximum anticipated detection range this is known as  antenna motion for pulse-doppler must be as slow as radar using  search radar that include pulse-doppler are usually dual mode because best overall performance is achieved when pulse-doppler is used for areas with high false alarm rates  horizon or below and weather  while conventional radar will scan faster in free-space where false alarm rate is low  above horizon with clear skies  the antenna type is an important consideration for multi-mode radar because undesirable phase shift introduced by the radar antenna can degrade  for sub-clutter visibility signal processing 
the signal processing enhancement of pulse-doppler allows small high-speed objects to be detected in close proximity to large slow moving reflectors to achieve this the transmitter must be coherent and should produce low  during the detection interval and the receiver must have large instantaneous  


pulse-doppler signal processing also includes ambiguity resolution to identify true range and velocity 


the received signals from multiple prf are compared to determine true range using the range ambiguity resolution process 


the received signals are also compared using the frequency ambiguity resolution process 


range resolution 
the range resolution is the minimum range separation between two objects traveling at the same speed before the radar can detect two discrete reflections 


velocity resolution 
the velocity resolution is the minimum radial velocity difference between two objects traveling at the same range before the radar can detect two discrete reflections 


special consideration 
pulse-doppler radar has special requirements that must be satisfied to achieve acceptable performance pulse repetition frequency 
main article  
pulse-doppler typically uses   prf  from about 3khz to 30khz the range between transmit pulses is 5km to 50km range and velocity cannot be measured directly using medium prf and ambiguity resolution is required to identify true range and speed doppler signals are generally above 1khz which is audible so audio signals from medium-prf systems can be used for passive target classification angular measurement 
radar systems require angular measurement transponders are not normally associated with pulse-doppler radar so sidelobe suppression is required for practical operation tracking radar systems use angle error to improve accuracy by producing measurements perpendicular to the radar antenna beam angular measurements are averaged over a span of time and combined with radial movement to develop information suitable to predict target position for a short time into the future the two angle error techniques used with tracking radar are monopulse and conical scan 



coherency 
pulse-doppler radar requires a  with very little noise  reduces sub-clutter visibility performance by producing apparent motion on stationary objects  and  are not appropriate because noise introduced by these devices interfere with detection performance the only amplification devices suitable for pulse-doppler are   and solid state devices scalloping 
main article  
pulse-doppler signal processing introduces a phenomenon called scalloping the name is associated with a series of holes that are scooped-out of the detection performance scalloping for pulse-doppler radar involves blind velocities created by the clutter rejection filter every volume of space must be scanned using 3 or more different prf a two prf detection scheme will have detection gaps with a pattern of discrete ranges each of which has a blind velocity windowing 
 pose a problem with search detection and ambiguity resolution in pulse-doppler radar ringing is reduced in two ways first the  is adjusted to smooth the leading edge and trailing edge so that rf power is increased and decreased without an abrupt change this creates a transmit pulse with smooth ends instead of a square wave which reduces ringing phenomenon that is otherwise associated with target reflection second the shape of the receive pulse is adjusted using a  that minimizes ringing that occurs any time pulses are applied to a filter in a digital system this adjusts the phase and or amplitude of each sample before it is applied to the  the  is the most effective because it produces a flat processing floor with no ringing that would otherwise cause false alarms antenna 
pulse-doppler radar is generally limited to mechanically aimed antennas and active phase array mechanical rf components such as wave-guide can produce doppler modulation due to phase shift induced by vibration this introduces a requirement to perform full spectrum operational tests using shake tables that can produce high power mechanical vibration across all anticipated audio frequencies doppler is incompatible with most electronically steered phase-array antenna this is because the phase-shifter elements in the antenna are non-reciprocal and the phase shift must be adjusted before and after each transmit pulse spurious phase shift is produced by the sudden impulse of the phase shift and settling during the receive period between transmit pulses places doppler modulation onto stationary clutter that receive modulation corrupts the  for sub-clutter visibility phase shifter settling time on the order of 50ns is required start of receiver sampling needs to be postponed at least 1 phase-shifter settling time-constant  or more  for each 20db of sub-clutter visibility most antenna phase shifters operating at prf above 1khz introduce spurious phase shift unless special provisions are made such as reducing phase shifter settling time to a few dozen nanoseconds the following gives the maximum permissible settling time for antenna

scv   sub-clutter visibility in 
s   number of range samples between each transmit pulse
prf   maximum design pulse repetition frequency

the antenna type and scan performance is a practical consideration for multi-mode radar systems diffraction 
choppy surfaces like waves and trees form a diffraction grating suitable for bending microwave signals pulse-doppler can be so sensitive that  from mountains buildings or wave tops can be used to detect fast moving objects otherwise blocked by solid obstruction along the line of sight this is a very lossy phenomenon that only becomes possible when radar has significant excess sub-clutter visibility refraction and ducting use transmit frequency at  or lower to extend the horizon which is very different from diffraction  for  uses variable density in the air column above the surface of the earth to bend rf signals an inversion layer can produce a transient  that traps rf signals in a thin layer of air like a wave-guide subclutter visibility 
subclutter visibility involves the maximum ratio of clutter power to target power which is proportional to dynamic range this determines performance in heavy weather and near the earth surface 


subclutter visibility is the ratio of the smallest signal that can be detected in the presence of a larger signal 


a small fast-moving target reflection can be detected in the presence of larger slow-moving clutter reflections when the following is true 


performance 
the pulse-doppler radar equation can be used to understand trade-offs between different design constraints like power consumption detection range and microwave safety hazards this is a very simple form of modeling that allows performance to be evaluated in a sterile environment the theoretical range performance is as follows 


where

r   distance to the target
pt   transmitter power
gt    of the transmitting antenna
ar   effective aperture  area  of the receiving antenna
    or scattering coefficient of the target
f   
d   doppler filter size  transmit pulses in each  
kb   
t   temperature  kelvin 
b   
n   

this equation is derived by combining the  with the  and accounting for in-band noise distribution across multiple detection filters the value d is added to the standard radar range equation to account for both  and  detection range is increased proportional to the fourth root of the number of filters for a given power consumption alternatively power consumption is reduced by the number of filers for a given detection range  integrates all of the energy from all of the individual reflected pulses that enter the filter this means a  system with 1,024 elements provides 30.103db of improvement due to the type of signal processing that must be used with pulse-doppler radar the energy of all of the individual pulses from the object are added together by the filtering process signal processing for a 1,024 point filter improves performance by 30.103db assuming compatible transmitter and antenna this corresponds to the following potential improvements 
562 increase in maximum distance 
these improvements are the reason pulse-doppler is essential for military and astronomy aircraft tracking uses 
pulse-doppler radar for aircraft detection has two modes 
scan
track

scan mode involves frequency filtering amplitude thresholding and ambiguity resolution once a reflection has been  and  the pulse-doppler radar automatically transitions to tracking mode for the volume of space surrounding the track track mode works like a  where doppler velocity is compared with the range movement on successive scans lock indicates the difference between the two measurements is below a threshold which can only occur with an object that satisfies  other types of electronic signals cannot produce a lock lock exists in no other type of radar the lock criteria needs to be satisfied during normal operation 


lock eliminates the need for human intervention with the exception of helicopters and  weather phenomenon obey  associated with  and not  so the lock criteria is not normally used for weather radar  selectively excludes low-velocity reflections so that no detections occurs below a threshold velocity this eliminates terrain weather biologicals and  with the exception of decoy aircraft the target doppler signal from the detection is converted from  back into  sound for the operator in track mode on some radar systems the operator uses this sound for passive target classification such as recognizing helicopters and electronic jamming helicopters 
special consideration is required for aircraft with large moving parts because pulse-doppler radar operates like a  blade tips moving near the speed of sound produce the only signal that can be detected when a  is moving slow near terrain and weather helicopters appears like a rapidly pulsing noise emitter except in a clear environment free from clutter an audible signal is produced for passive identification of the type of airborne object microwave doppler frequency shift produced by reflector motion falls into the audible sound range for human beings  20  20,000 hz  which is used for target classification in addition to the kinds of conventional  used for that purpose like a-scope b-scope c-scope and rhi indicator the human ear may be able to tell the difference better than electronic equipment a special mode is required because the doppler velocity feedback information must be unlinked from radial movement so that the system can transition from scan to track with no lock similar techniques are required to develop track information for jamming signals and interference that cannot satisfy the lock criteria multi-mode 
pulse-doppler radar must be multi-mode to handle aircraft turning and crossing trajectory once in track mode pulse-doppler radar must include a way to modify doppler filtering for the volume of space surrounding a track when radial velocity falls below the minimum detection velocity doppler filter adjustment must be linked with a  to automatically adjust doppler rejection speed within the volume of space surrounding the track tracking will cease without this feature because the target signal will otherwise be rejected by the doppler filter when radial velocity approaches zero multi-mode operation may also include continuous wave illumination for  see also
