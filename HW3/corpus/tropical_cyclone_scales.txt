background 

tropical cyclones are defined as being warm cored non-frontal synoptic cyclones that develop over tropical or subtropical waters with organized  and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation they are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked by the  s  on one of five tropical cyclone scales the scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in  with for example the  and the australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the western hemisphere all of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds which are either observed measured or estimated using various techniques over a period between one and ten minutes atlantic eastern and central pacific

tropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere to the east of the  are officially monitored by either the  or the  within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored non-frontal synoptic disturbance that develops over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre the region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones once either of these classifications are met then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33kn  38mph  62km h  however if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 3463kn  3973mph  63118km h  then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and  should the tropical system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured as greater than 64kn  74mph  119km h  then it will be called a hurricane and classified on the  the lowest classification on the sshws is a category 1 hurricane which has winds of between 6482kn  7495mph 119153km h  should the hurricane intensify further then it will be rated as a category 2 hurricane if it has winds of between 8395kn  96110mph 154177km h  when a system becomes a category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96112kn  111129mph 178208km h  it is considered to be a major hurricane by the warning centers a category 4 hurricane has winds of 113136kn  130156mph 209251km h  while a category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137kn  157mph 252km h  a post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage however advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone poses a significant threat to life and property they may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48hours the sshs was originally created using both wind speed and storm surge but since the relationship between wind speed and storm surge is not necessarily definite the scale was changed to the  saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale   sshws  based entirely on wind speed although increasing echelons of the scale correspond to stronger winds the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms depending on factors such as local terrain population density and total rainfall for instance a  hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more damage than a large category5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region in fact tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties especially from flooding and landslides historically the term great hurricane was used to describe storms that possessed winds of at least 110  125mph  200km h  large radii  over 160   100  and that caused large amounts of destruction this term fell into disuse after the introduction of the saffirsimpson scale in the early 1970s a minor change to the scale was made ahead of the 2012 hurricane season with the wind speeds for categories 35 tweaked to eliminate the rounding errors that had occurred during previous seasons when a hurricane had wind speeds of 115kn  130mph  215km h

tropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere between the  and  are officially monitored by the   jma rsmc tokyo  within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a non-frontal synoptic scale cyclone originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation the lowest classification used by the typhoon committee is a tropical depression which has 10-minute sustained winds of less than 33kn  17m s  38mph  61km h  should the tropical depression intensify further it is named and classified as a tropical storm which has winds speeds between 3347kn  1724m s  3854mph  6187km h  should the system continue to intensify further then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm which has winds speeds between 4863kn  2532m s  5572mph  89117km h  the highest classification on the typhoon committee s scale is a typhoon which has winds speeds greater than 64kn  33m s  74mph  119km h  the  the   hko   and the jma all divide the typhoon category further for domestic purposes the jma divides the typhoon category into three categories with a 10-minute maximum wind speed below 84kn  43m s  97mph  156km h  assigned for the  strong  typhoon category a very strong typhoon has wind speeds between 85104kn  4454m s  98120mph  157193km h  while a violent typhoon has wind speeds of 105kn  54m s  121mph  194km h  or greater the hko and the cma also divide the typhoon category into three categories with both assigning a maximum wind speed of 80kn  41m s  92mph  150km h  to the typhoon category a severe typhoon has wind speeds of 85104kn  4454m s  98120mph  157193km h  while a super typhoon has winds of 100kn  51m s  120mph  190km h  during may 2015 pagasa introduced the term super typhoon and used it for systems with winds greater than 120kn  62m s  140mph  220km h  in addition to the national meteorological services of each nation the united states joint typhoon warning center monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the united states government these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however the jtwc uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin these classifications are tropical depression tropical storm typhoon and super typhoon in addition the taiwan  has its own scale in chinese but uses the typhoon committee scale in english north indian ocean 

any tropical cyclone that develops within the north indian ocean between  and  is monitored by the   imd rsmc new delhi  within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation the lowest official classification used in the north indian ocean is a depression which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 1727kn  2031mph  3149km h  should the depression intensify further then it will become a deep depression which has winds between 2833kn  3238mph  5061km h  the system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the imd if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 3447kn  3954mph  6288km h  severe cyclonic storms have storm force wind speeds of between 4863kn  5572mph  89117km h  while very severe cyclonic storms have hurricane-force winds of 6489kt  73102mph  118166km h  extremely severe cyclonic storms have hurricane-force winds of 90119kn  166221km h 104137mph  the highest classification used in the north indian ocean is a super cyclonic storm which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn  138mph  222km h  historically a system has been classified as a depression if it is an area where the barometric pressure is low compared with its surroundings other classifications historically used include  cyclonic storm where the winds did not exceed  on the beaufort scale and a cyclone where the winds are either force 11 and 12 on the beaufort scale between 1924 and 1988 tropical cyclones were classified into four categories  depression deep depression cyclonic storms and severe cyclonic storms however a change was made during 1988 to introduce the category  severe cyclonic storm with core of hurricane winds  for tropical cyclones with wind speeds of more than 64kn  74mph  119km h  during 1999 the categories very severe cyclonic storm and super cyclonic storm were introduced while the severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds category was eliminated during 2015 another modification to the intensity scale took place with the imd calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90119kn  166221km h 104137mph  an extremely severe cyclonic storm the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in this basin the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones

tropical cyclones that occur within the southern hemisphere to the east of 90e are officially monitored by one or more tropical cyclone warning centres these are run by the  new zealand s  indonesia s  papua new guinea s national weather service while three others are run by the australian  within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non-frontal low pressure system of synoptic scale that develops over warm waters with a definite organized wind circulation and 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 34kn  63km h  39mph  or greater near the centre once this definition has been met then all of the centres name the system and start to use the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which measures tropical cyclones using a five category system based on 10-minute maximum sustained winds a category 1 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 3447kn  3954mph  6387km h  while a category 2 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 4863kn  5572mph  89117km h  when a system becomes a category 3 tropical cyclone it is reclassified as a severe tropical cyclone and has wind speeds of 6485kn  7498mph  119157km h  a category 4 severe tropical cyclone has winds of 86110 kn  99130mph  157200km h  while the maximum rating is a category 5 severe tropical cyclone which has winds of at least 110kn  130mph  200km h  for systems below tropical cyclone strength there are various terms used including tropical disturbance tropical low and tropical depression a tropical disturbance is defined as being a non frontal system of synoptic scale originating over the tropics with persistent enhanced convection and or some indication of a circulation a tropical depression or tropical low is a disturbance with a defined circulation where the central position can be estimated and the maximum 10-minute average wind speed is less than 34kn  39mph  63km h  near the centre the fms numbers these systems when they have a potential to develop into a tropical cyclone or persist to cause significant impact to life and property within its area of responsibility and have been analysed for the previous 24 hours the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale was introduced by the bom ahead of the 198990 cyclone season the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in these basins the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclones 
alternative scales 
there are other scales that are not officially used by any of the  or the  however they are used by other organizations such as the  an example of such scale is the  which measures the destructive potential of the storm surge  it works on a scale that ranges from one to six with six having the highest destructive potential   ace  is used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and other agencies to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons it is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm  wind speed 35 knots or higher  at six-hour intervals the numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable the unit of ace is 104 kn2 and for use as an index the unit is assumed as well as being squared for ace wind speed can also be cubed which is referred to as the  the   hsi  is another scale used and rates the severity of all types of tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields the hsi is a 0 to 50 point scale allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone s intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size points are awarded on a sliding scale with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields comparisons across basins 
the terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another below is a summary of the classifications used by the  worldwide
