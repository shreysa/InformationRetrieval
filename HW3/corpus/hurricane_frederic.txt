meteorological history 




map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the 


the precursor to hurricane frederic emerged as a loosely defined  off the west coast of africa late on august27 the following day satellite images indicated that the tropical wave had become more defined and was beginning to show signs of  at 0600 on august29 the  nhc  classified the system as a  based on observational data from ships nearby in conjunction with satellite images upon  into a tropical cyclone the depression moved at an unusually rapid pace westward gradually curving towards the west-northwest and slowly intensifying in ideal conditions at 1200utc on august30 the tropical depression was upgraded to  status and thus  frederic intensification continued after the storm s upgrade and early on september1 frederic developed an  prompting the nhc to further upgrade the tropical cyclone to hurricane status at 0600utc that day frederic only maintained hurricane intensity for roughly eighteen hours over the open waters of the atlantic on september1 before  from nearby  began to adversely affect the tropical cyclone at 0000utc on september2 frederic weakened back to tropical storm strength while it was still well east of the  this weakening phase continued as frederic began to assume a more westerly track and slow in forward motion on september4 frederic tracked over the  before making  on  later that day with  of 50mph  80km h  frederic s interaction with puerto rico greatly disrupted the low-level circulation contained within the tropical cyclone enhancing the weakening effects of hurricane david s outflow after passing over the island the tropical storm briefly took a southwest course before curving into  on september6 inducing additional disruption within frederic at 1800utc that day frederic was downgraded to tropical depression status north of  frederic remained a tropical depression for two days as it tracked into and then parallel to the southern coast of  beginning on september7 during this time hurricane david had tracked far into the  and as a result its inhibiting effects of intensification ceased at 0000utc on september9 frederic regained tropical storm intensity while located roughly 100mi  160km h  east of the  the following day the cyclone tracked over western cuba as it gradually curved towards the northwest favorable conditions marked by very warm  as high as 86f 30c  and the presence of a large  over the system allowed frederic to strengthen to hurricane status for a second time while just northwest of cuba despite proximity to land frederic took a northwesterly course throughout its trek across the  in early september intensifying in a highly conducive environment by 1800utc on september10 the hurricane became stronger than it had ever been over the central atlantic at 0000utc on september12 frederic attained  status over the eastern  and twelve hours later reached peak intensity with a minimum  of 943   27.85  and sustained winds of 135mph  215km h  making the cyclone a category4 hurricane on the  moving gradually faster in the gulf of mexico frederic eventually made two landfalls one on  and the other near the border between  and  with a virtually unchanged intensity tracking rapidly northward frederic began to weaken due to land interaction and was downgraded to tropical storm status while it was near  on september13 at around the same time the cyclone began to curve northeastward eventually merging with an  in southwestern  by 1800utc on september14 these extratropical remnants proceeded to track through the  and  before they were last officially documented by the nhc in  on september15 however the  still considered the cyclone active up until the storm entered the  on september16 
preparations 




evacuation out of the mobile area


the first  issued in association with frederic were on september3 when the national hurricane center issued a  and  for several islands of the  stretching from  to the northern  residents of  in the  were urged by governor  to move to 24emergency shelters luis also mobilized a company of the  to expedite evacuations and protect emptied residences and other buildings from looting further south in   was forced to close due to the precense of gale force winds delaying relief efforts following hurricane david despite having weakened to a tropical storm by the time frederic moved over the virgin islands the national hurricane center issued a  for puerto rico on september4 as precautionary measures the  and schools closed for the duration of the storm hundreds of residents were ordered to evacuate from  for the second time in just four days due to the threat of flooding rivers in  a dike was relieved in order to mitigate potential flooding after its track across puerto rico gale warnings were issued for portions of the  and  as well as the  no watches or warnings were issued by the nhc for any areas while frederic was classified as a tropical depression over the greater antilles however small craft warnings were posted for some coastal regions off of  due to strong winds caused by the nearby tropical cyclone after frederic reattained hurricane status in the gulf of mexico on september10 a gale warning were issued for the   this was the first nhc warning issued in association with the newly developed tropical cyclone not long after a hurricane watch was issued for coastal areas extending from  to  in  although forecasts showed that frederic posed no threat to  the city readied barrels of water if distribution was necessitated to  s 58emergency shelters municipality managers were asked to place their respective emergency personnel on standby in  city workers had shortened workdays while the storm moved close by up to 500,000 were evacuated from the u.s gulf coast in anticipation of frederic s arrival effects from frederic were first felt on the outward facing leeward islands in  the threat of widespread  forced the insular government to shut down power a peak gust of 62mph  100km h  was documented on the island as a result of the storm these strong winds also unroofed some buildings strong winds and rain were felt in   and a number of other islands but no damaging effects from the passing tropical cyclone occurred in those locations power outages knocked out electricity to half of  in the  and downed telephone lines rainfall and downed trees blocked several roads offshore the  princess blew out into sea prompting a coast guard rescue of the ship and its crew as a tropical storm frederic dropped heavy rain across the u.s virgin islands and puerto rico despite having weakened from its prior hurricane intensity the storm still broughtforce winds coupled with gusts as strong as 70mph  110km h  to the area three apartments in the same apartment complex on  were unroofed displacing roughly 50families electricity was deliberately cut during the late night hours to prevent the spread of power outages in  these strong winds toppled a  the entirety of the u.s virgin islands reported numerous felled trees and downed utility lines as a result of the strong winds wind damage on nearby puerto rico was of only minor extent and much less severe than in the virgin islands however torrential precipitation accounted for most of the damage as the passage of hurricane david less than a week earlier saturated soils priming the area for floods induced by the passage of frederic rainfall peaked at around 10in  250mm  in 12hours in puerto rico and 24.04in  611mm  in 30hours in  



rainfall totals in puerto rico and the u.s virgin islands


all rivers in southeastern puerto rico swelled and produce significant flooding in adjacent floodplains the  of the  near  reached  these floods partially inundated several cities submerged crops and damaged numerous roads major arterial roads to and from  were blocked by floodwater and landslide debris some portions of  were submerged by water from both the torrential rain and wave action damage from frederic in puerto rico reached at least us 5million though western puerto rico sustained minimal damage from the storm in st thomas four small homes were destroyed by flooding and an additional fifty sustained at least partial damage one  was reported off the coast but did no damage normally dry  in st croix filled with floodwater from frederic damaging homes and other buildings in five communities on st croix culverts bridges and heavy  resulted from rough surf off the coast of the island the floods generated various sewage problems flowing floodwaters washed away plentiful food crops in st maarten some homes were damaged and others destroyed on the adjacent  off of the island seven people were killed after their fishing boat sank during the storm damage in virgin islands also reached at least us 5million similar to puerto rico hispaniola and cuba 
heavy rains buffeted the islands of  and cuba for several days as frederic albeit disorganized tracked over the  as with puerto rico and the lesser antilles precipitation damage was exacerbated by the recent passage of hurricane david in  on cuba s eastern atlantic coast at least 6.88in  175mm  of rainfall was reported frederic continued to produce strong winds even as a weak tropical depression south of cuba as sustained winds of 46mph  74km h  were clocked in  on september7 however damage from frederic in hispaniola and eastern cuba remained minimal frederic s landfall on western cuba as a redeveloped tropical cyclone was much more significant than its first cuban landfall sustained winds peaked at 52mph  84km h  in  on september10 despite recent renovations at  the lack of a proper drainage system allowed rainfall to inundate the airport stranding several heads of state that were scheduled to hold a  and disrupting air traffic to and from the airport for an entire week heavy precipitation triggered numerous landslides causing severe damage to infrastructure and over 250dwellings areas at risk for additional landslide activity were declared inhospitable resulting in the evacuation of 1,200people rainfall estimates in cuba peaked at 5in  125mm  a lack of damage reports was evident from western cuba following frederic s landfall though damage estimates were high united states 




the dauphin island bridge was destroyed by hurricane frederic making it only reachable by boat 

storm surge damage was reported along 80miles of coastline from  to  with tides 8 to 12feet  2.4-3.7 m  above the normal level being observed five deaths were directly attributed to frederic in the united states four of which occurred inland  a person swept from a boat near  was the only casualty along the coast in total frederic was responsible for  2.3billion  1979 usd   7.5 billion 2015 usd  in damages this made frederic the costliest hurricane in the history of the united states at the time  the figure was not surpassed until  in 1989 frederic also dumped heavy rainfall across much of the eastern united states over a dozen tornadoes were also reported in frederic s wake however these had minimal impact florida 
as frederic was strengthening in the gulf of mexico strong winds were reported in the  a station on the dry tortugas recorded a 58mph  93km h  wind gust on september10  this was stronger than any other florida wind gust measurement in association with frederic a station in key west florida clocked at 43mph  69km h  wind gust coupled with sustained winds of 29mph  47km h  tides in the dry tortugas peaked at 15ft  4.6m  roughly 12ft  6.7m  above normal rainfall from the extremities of the hurricane reached  with some rainfall totals exceeding 7in  180mm  alabama 
frederic made landfall at  and continued across to a point on the alabama mississippi state line near  near-total property damage occurred along the alabama coastline between  and  the latter seeing 80 of its buildings completely destroyed the causeway linking  to the mainland was swept away in many areas alabama s second-largest city  suffered extensive damage as well wind damage was also severe especially across southern alabama hurricane-force gusts were felt as far inland as  structural failure was widespread in the immediate landfall area with industrial residential and governmental buildings as well as hospitals suffering heavy damage nearly 90 of the mobile area lost electricity and the historic city hall experienced heavy roof damage many small beach houses were completely destroyed by high winds before the storm surge could add any effects tree damage with broken limbs was extensive leaving thousands of tall pine trees all tilted leaning in the direction the wind had come 11 alabama counties were declared disaster areas mississippi 
8 to 12inches of rain fell in  around biloxi and pascagoula 16 mississippi counties were declared disaster areas  the most in the united states hurricane force winds were felt as far northward as  canada 
frederic dropped heavy rain across canada as an extratropical storm peaking at 137mm  5.39in  near  record precipitation was recorded at the  in  which documented 77mm  3.03in  of rain on september15 rainfall spread as far northeast as the eastern coast of  flooding occurred in eastern ontario and portions of the  as noted in  in  the rains led to a seven-car  and a separate car accident that injured two flooding also took place in southern  with floodwater submerging streets basements and underground parking lots in  damage from southern quebec reached 8.238million  us 7.095million  aftermath 




damage after hurricane frederic in gulf shores alabama 

eleven counties in alabama sixteen in mississippi and five in florida were declared eligible for disaster aid in retrospect frederic has been credited with spurring redevelopment in mobile and the surrounding gulf coast region for example in testimony before congress in 1992 robert sheets  then the director of the   described the economic aftermath of frederic 

 prior to hurricane frederic there was one  on  most of the homes were single individual homes built behind the sand dunes today where there used to be one condominium there are now at least 104 complexes not units complexes on gulf shores alabama
