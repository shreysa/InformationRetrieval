climate 
the climate north of the  is affected by a  climate strong north-east winds blow from october until april  from may until october south and west winds prevail in the arabian sea the violent monsoon brings rain to the indian subcontinent in the southern hemisphere the winds are generally milder but summer storms near mauritius can be severe when the monsoon winds change cyclones sometimes strike the shores of the arabian sea and the  the indian ocean is the warmest ocean in the world long-term ocean temperature records show a rapid continuous warming in the indian ocean at about 0.71.2c  1.32.2f  during 19012012 indian ocean warming is the largest among the tropical oceans and about 3 times faster than the warming observed in the pacific research indicates that human induced  and changes in the frequency and magnitude of  events are a trigger to this strong warming in the indian ocean oceanography

among the tropical oceans the western indian ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of  blooms in summer due to the strong  winds the monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean  which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production these phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem as the base of the marine food web and eventually the larger fish species the indian ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable  catch its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export fishing fleets from    and  also exploit the indian ocean mainly for  and tuna research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem a study on the phytoplankton changes in the indian ocean indicates a decline of up to 20 in the marine phytoplankton in the indian ocean during the past six decades the tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century mostly due to increased industrial fisheries with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species endangered marine species include the    and  an  was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5million square kilometres  1.9million square miles  riding the southern  this vortex of  constantly circulates the ocean from australia to africa down the  and back to australia in a period of six years except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre in 2016 uk researchers from  identified six new animal species at  beneath the indian ocean these new species were a  hoff  crab a  giant peltospirid  snail a whelk-like snail a limpet a scaleworm and a polychaete worm history

first settlements 
the history of the indian ocean is marked by maritime trade  cultural and commercial exchange probably date back at least seven thousand years during this period independent short-distance oversea communications along its  margins have evolved into an all-embracing network the dbut of this network was not the achievement of a centralised or advanced civilisation but of local and regional exchange in the persian gulf the red sea and arabian sea sherds of   2500500bce  pottery have been found in the western gulf at  present-day   traces of exchange between this trading centre and   traded grain pottery and   used for   for copper stone timber tin dates onions and pearls coast-bound vessels transported goods between the  civilisation  26001900  in india  modern-day pakistan and gujarat in india  and the persian gulf and egypt  an  guide to the world beyond the red sea including africa and india from the first century ce not only gives insights into trade in the region but also shows that roman and greek sailors had already gained knowledge about the  winds the contemporaneous settlement of  by  sailors shows that the littoral margins of the indian ocean were being both well-populated and regularly traversed at least by this time albeit the monsoon must have been common knowledge in the indian ocean for centuries the world s earliest civilizations in   beginning with    and the   beginning with the   which began along the valleys of the   and  rivers respectively all developed around the indian ocean civilizations soon arose in   beginning with   and later in   beginning with   during  s first dynasty  c 3000bce  sailors were sent out onto its waters journeying to  thought to be part of present-day  returning ships brought gold and myrrh the earliest known maritime trade between mesopotamia and the indus valley  c 2500 bc  was conducted along the indian ocean  of the late 3rd millennium bce may have entered the area but no settlements resulted the indian ocean s relatively calmer waters opened the areas bordering it to trade earlier than the atlantic or  oceans the powerful monsoons also meant ships could easily sail west early in the season then wait a few months and return eastwards this allowed ancient  peoples to cross the indian ocean to settle in  around 1ce era of discovery
