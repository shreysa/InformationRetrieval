volume is the  of  enclosed by a  for example the space that a substance     or   or shape occupies or contains volume is often quantified numerically using the  the  the volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container  i e the amount of fluid  gas or liquid  that the container could hold rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes volumes of some simple shapes such as regular straight-edged and circular shapes can be easily calculated using   volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by  if a formula exists for the shape s boundary where a variance in shape and volume occurs such as those that exist between different human beings these can be calculated using three-dimensional techniques such as the  one-dimensional figures  such as   and two-dimensional shapes  such as   are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space the volume of a solid  whether regularly or irregularly shaped  can be determined by  displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas the combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances however sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not  in  volume is expressed by means of the  and is an important global   in  volume is a  and is a  to

volume measurements from the 1914  



any unit of  gives a corresponding unit of volume  the volume of a  whose sides have the given length for example a   cm3  is the volume of a cube whose sides are one   1cm  in length in the   si  the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre  m3  the  also includes the   l  as a unit of volume where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube thus

1 litre    10 cm 3   1000 cubic centimetres   0.001 cubic metres 
so

1 cubic metre   1000 litres 
small amounts of liquid are often measured in  where

1 millilitre   0.001 litres   1 cubic centimetre 
various other traditional units of volume are also in use including the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  the  and the  related terms 
capacity is defined by the  as  the measure applied to the content of a vessel and to liquids grain or the like which take the shape of that which holds them   the word capacity has other unrelated meanings as in e.g   capacity is not identical in meaning to volume though closely related  the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior units of capacity are the  litre and its derived units and imperial units such as    and others units of volume are the cubes of  in si the units of volume and capacity are closely related  one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre the capacity of a cube with a 10cm side in other systems the conversion is not trivial  the capacity of a vehicle s fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet for example but in gallons  a gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft  the  of an object is defined as the ratio of the mass to the volume the inverse of density is  which is defined as volume divided by mass specific volume is a concept important in  where the  is often an important parameter of a system being studied the  in  is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time  for example cubic meters per second   volume in calculus

in  a branch of  the volume of a region d in r3 is given by a  of the constant   and is usually written as 



the volume integral in  is

volume formulas 

volume ratios for a cone sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height 




a cone sphere and cylinder of radius r and height h


the above formulas can be used to show that the volumes of a  sphere and  of the same radius and height are in the ratio 1 2 3 as follows let the radius be r and the height be h  which is 2r for the sphere  then the volume of cone is



the volume of the sphere is



while the volume of the cylinder is



the discovery of the 2 3 ratio of the volumes of the sphere and cylinder is credited to  volume formula derivations
the volume of a  is the  of an infinite number of infinitesimally small circular  of thickness dx the calculation for the volume of a sphere with center 0 and radius r is as follows the surface area of the circular disk is  the radius of the circular disks defined such that the x-axis cuts perpendicularly through them is



or



where y or z can be taken to represent the radius of a disk at a particular x value using y as the disk radius the volume of the sphere can be calculated as



now



combining yields 
this formula can be derived more quickly using the formula for the sphere s  which is  the volume of the sphere consists of layers of infinitesimally thin spherical shells and the sphere volume is equal to



cone 
the cone is a type of pyramidal shape the fundamental equation for pyramids one-third times base times altitude applies to cones as well however using calculus the volume of a  is the  of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin circular  of thickness dx the calculation for the volume of a cone of height h whose base is centered at  0 0 0  with radius r is as follows the radius of each circular disk is r if x   0 and 0 if x   h and varying linearly in betweenthat is 


the surface area of the circular disk is then



the volume of the cone can then be calculated as



and after extraction of the constants



integrating gives us



volume in differential geometry
