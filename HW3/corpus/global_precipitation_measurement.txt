global precipitation measurement  gpm  is a joint mission between  and  as well as other international space agencies to make frequent  every 23 hours  observations of earths  it is part of nasa s earth systematic missions program and works with a  to provide full global coverage the project provides global precipitation maps to assist researchers in improving the forecasting of extreme events studying global climate and adding to current capabilities for using such satellite data to benefit society gpm builds on the notable successes of the   trmm  which was also a joint nasa-jaxa activity the project is managed by nasa s  and consists of a gpm core observatory satellite assisted by a constellation of spacecraft from other agencies and missions the core observatory satellite measures the two and three dimensional structure of earths precipitation patterns and provides a new calibration standard for the rest of the satellite constellation the gpm core observatory was assembled and tested at goddard space flight center and launched from  japan on a   rocket the launch occurred on february 28 2014 at 3 37am jst on the first attempt agencies in the united states   and   together with   operate the remaining satellites in the constellation for agency-specific goals but also cooperatively provide data for gpm

gpm core observatory instruments 





visualization of gpm collecting data on march 17th 2014 over the last major snow storm of winter 2013-2014 to hit the u.s east coast 





the gpm core observatory in the electromagnetic testing chamber at nasa goddard space flight center in march 2013 the silver disc and drum  center  is the gpm microwave imager and the large block on the base is the dual-frequency precipitation radar 

dual-frequency precipitation radar  dpr 
the dpr is a spaceborne radar providing three-dimensional maps of storm structure across its swath including the intensity of rainfall and snowfall at the surface the dpr has two frequencies allowing researchers to estimate the sizes of precipitation particles and detect a wider range of precipitation rates the ku-band radar similar to the pr on trmm covers a 245km  152 mile  swath nested inside that the ka-band radar covers a 120km  74.5 mile  swath gpm microwave imager  gmi 
the gmi is a passive sensor that observes the microwave energy emitted by the earth and atmosphere at 13 different frequency polarization channels these data allow quantitative maps of precipitation across a swath that is 885km  550 miles  wide this instrument continues the legacy of trmm microwave observations while adding four additional channels better resolution and more reliable calibration precipitation data sets 
gpm produces and distributes a wide variety of precipitation data products processing takes place at the precipitation processing system  pps  at nasa  as well as at the jaxa facility in japan data is provided at multiple  levels  of processing from raw satellite measurements to best-estimate global precipitation maps using combinations of all the constellation observations and other meteorological data all data from the mission is made freely available to the public on nasa websites precipitation data is made available in a variety of formats spatial and temporal resolutions and processing levels which are accessible on the precipitation measurement missions  data access  webpage several data visualization and analysis tools have been made available to provide easy access for the science and applications communities which include the in-browser earth science data analysis tool giovanni a web api and a 3d near-realtime global precipitation viewer

social media and outreach 





this animation shows gpm collecting some of its very first data on march 10th over a pacific storm east of japan 

in addition to maintaining social media accounts and the   and  developed several outreach activities specific to this mission prior to launch that the public could participate in after launch a series of featured articles and videos were produced to highlight various scientific goals and discoveries of the mission and an  extreme weather  blog is maintained to provide timely updates about the latest extreme precipitation events and natural disasters occurring around the world a precipitation education website is also maintained to provide teachers and students with lesson plans animations and other resources to teach about the  earth science and the gpm mission
