the intrinsically exponential complexity of the circularity problem for attribute grammars attribute grammars are an extension of context-free grammars devised by knuth as a mechanism for including the semantics of a context-free language with the syntax of the language the circularity problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semantics for all possible sentences programs in fact will be well defined it is proved that this problem is in general computationally intractable Specifically, it is shown that any deterministic algorithm which solves the problem must for infinitely many cases use an exponential amount of timen improved version of knuths circularity testing algorithm is also given which actually solves the problem within exponential time cacm December, 1975 Jazayeri, M.
