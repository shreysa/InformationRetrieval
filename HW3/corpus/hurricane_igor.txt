hurricane igor was first identified as a broad  accompanying a  over western  in early september2010 tracking nearly due west the system emerged into the eastern  on september6 gradual  took place as   activity consolidated around its center at 0600 on september8 the low was deemed sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression while situated roughly 90mi  140km  southeast of the  attaining gale-force winds six hours later the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was subsequently named igor by the  development of igor quickly ceased once it was named as a nearby disturbance produced moderate  over the storm displacing convection from its center embedded within a  over the eastern atlantic the system maintained a slow westward track as it weakened to a tropical depression on september9 intensification resumed the following day once shear lessened and the dominant steering factor shifted to a mid-tropospheric  north of igor  it would remain so throughout the remainder of the cyclone s existence contrary to its earlier movement the storm s forward motion markedly increased following the development of an intermittent  and steady convection around its center igor strengthened into a hurricane around 0000utc on september12 

once classified a hurricane igor underwent  over the following 24hours during this time satellite observations indicated that the storm s winds increased from 75mph  120km h  to 150mph  240km h  and its  decreased by 52   1.53  near the end of this phase forecasters at the nhc predicted that igor would attain  status the highest classification on the  with a symmetrical 17mi  27km  wide eye deep convection and  igor maintained  intensity for nearly five days minor fluctuations took place during this period as multiple  occurred after the first of these cycles the hurricane is estimated to have reached its peak strength around 0000utc on september15 with sustained winds of 155mph  250km h  and an estimated minimum pressure of 924mbar  hpa  27.29inhg  by this time igor began a northwestward track as it executed a prolonged  c-shaped  curve over the atlantic ocean

long seen to be within igor s track bermuda was finally placed under a hurricane watch on september17 as the threat became imminent later that day the watch was upgraded to a warning as hurricane-force winds were anticipated to impact the islands within the following 24hours this remained in place for nearly three days while igor battered bermuda following the passage of hurricane winds the advisory was changed to a tropical storm warning early on september20 before being discontinued later that day the bermudian government closed its schools and the  on september20 and 21 in anticipation of igor no evacuation plans were put in place although a local high school was converted into a shelter for residents who felt unsafe in their homes residents boarded up structures with plywood in order to protect windows tourists on the island wanting to escape the storm left more than a week before igor s arrival additionally a  vessel and helicopter were stationed offshore to assist with recovery efforts once the storm passed prior to igor s arrival there were fears that the enormous hurricane would be worse than  in  and could  flatten  the territory these fears resulted from forecasts from the national hurricane center which indicated the storm would strike bermuda as a category3 hurricane however following post-storm analysis it was found that the forecast model consensus overestimated the storm s future intensity although effects from igor were observed in bermuda for several days relatively little rain fell with the highest amount being 3.19in  81mm  winds proved to be the most significant factor  sustained winds reached 91mph  146km h  and gusts peaked at 117mph  188km h  at an unofficial awos station on st david s lighthouse additionally a  of 1.75ft  0.53m  took place in  this combined with tides to produce a storm tide of over 4ft  1.22m  as the storm arrived the island s airport was shut down earlier than originally planned due to the threat of  against initial fears igor left relatively little damage across bermuda the most significant impact was from downed trees and powerlines which cut power to 27,500residents a few emergency rescues had to be made during the storm but no injuries took place the causeway-bridge connecting st georges islands to the main island of bermuda sustained minor damage leaving one lane closed for several days waves over 15ft  4.6m  battered the coast breaking several ships from their moorings and tossing them into rocks officials in bermuda stated that the biggest loss from igor would be lessened tourism revenue following a mass exodus prior to the hurricane s arrival throughout the islands damage from the storm was less than  500,000 canada 




rainfall from hurricane igor in newfoundland


on september20 roughly one day prior to igor s arrival in  the  issued  for southern  and the  territory of  the following day the chc issued a hurricane watch for the eastern and northern coasts although sustained hurricane-force winds were recorded across parts of the island warnings were not issued due to stronger-than-expected re-intensification of the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on september22 all advisories were discontinued as igor moved away from the region in response to the storm s arrival schools were closed and several flights were delayed or canceled at  offshore an oil rig with 110 personnel was mostly evacuated near the coast of newfoundland on september19 in comparison to  two weeks earlier there was substantially less media attention given to igor attributed to the possibility of it going out to sea the combination of a  and significant moisture from hurricane igor resulted in unprecedented rainfall across parts of eastern newfoundland leading to widespread flooding in  more than 10in  250mm  was estimated to have fallen between september20 and 21 in  a confirmed 9.37in  238mm  of rain fell ranking igor as the third-wettest tropical cyclone in canadian history the widespread nature of heavy rains ranked the storm as a  similar to the rainfall winds across eastern newfoundland were exacerbated by the interaction of the front and igor in  near where the center of igor tracked sustained winds of 80mph  130km h  and gusts to 107mph  172km h  battered the area no records for sustained winds or gusts were broken  however it was noted as a 1-in-50 year event even with powerful  taken into account along the coast igor produced a  of 3.5ft  1.1m  additionally offshore waves reached immense heights measured up to 83.6ft  25.5m  one buoy reported a wave of 92ft  28m  but data is subject to further analysis to verify it the most significant impacts from igor were attributed to torrential rains which led to excessive  and flash flooding several rivers rose to record levels across the  and  where many roads were washed out entire bridges homes and portions of roads were destroyed in some instances flood waters were higher than entire homes in response to the widespread floods  warned residents who still had power by the afternoon of september21 to turn off their  if water enters their basement parts of  had to be evacuated by boat during the storm as rising water flooded some areas of the small town portions of  had to be evacuated under similar circumstances after a state of emergency was declared for the town water and sewage lines in  broke due to flooding in  downed power lines sparked two fires during the storm both of which were put out by firefighters without injuries roughly 150communities were temporarily isolated as all roads leading to them were severely damaged or washed out overall damage to roadways was regarded as  colossal  by tom hedderson the minister for emergency preparedness a 100ft  30m  section of the  in  was severely eroded leaving a large ravine behind and disconnecting the main population of newfoundland from the rest of the island while a bridge washout on the burin peninsula left 20,000people cut off from the rest of the island public infrastructure losses were estimated in excess of  100million mainly attributed to roadways on  a man was killed when his driveway collapsed from flooding and he was swept out to sea in addition to flood damage hurricane-force winds downed trees and power lines over large areas and many homes were damaged to varying degrees an estimated 50,000residences were left without electricity in the region the small coastal community of south east bight sustained some of the most significant wind damage where entire fishing sheds were hurled into the air along the east coast hiking trail an estimated 5,000 trees were downed in all losses from the hurricane were placed at  200million ranking it as the costliest cyclone in newfoundland history in terms of its overall impact igor was regarded as the worst storm of tropical origin to hit newfoundland since  aftermath

in igor s wake a  was declared for 30communities in newfoundland the mayor of one of the towns affected by igor sam synard remarked that  we ve never seen such a violent storm before  more than 50 families involved in the storm-induced destruction were relocated to evacuation shelters electricity was gradually restored to residents  by six days after the hurricane s passage a few hundred had yet to regain power in light of the widespread damage 1,000personnel from the  were brought in for recovery efforts the military operation known as operation lama was to last for the duration of the emergency phase in the immediate aftermath an initial deployment of 120soldiers and 40vehicles arrived on september25 from the  in  arrived in newfoundland three ships and a fleet of helicopters were called in for the distribution of emergency aid and the military set up temporary bridges while long-term plans for reconstruction were made operation lama also enabled partial repairs of several buildings and simultaneously emergency personnel surveyed roughly 500mi  900km  of roads in newfoundland on september27 government officials stated that it would take months for cleanup efforts to finish ten days after the storm six towns were still isolated as progress on temporary road reconstruction was being made only slowly allocation of military aid continued through october6 though the number of on-scene personnel began to decrease two days earlier roughly a month after the storm a benefit concert was held in  the concert raised about  400,000  2010  toward storm relief in one night in late october the government of newfoundland and labrador allocated  275,000 in funds for 200workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in  and  however union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient and accounted for just 420 of 600work hours following more than a year of discussions the plant s parent company ocean choice international decided to permanently shut down operations on december2 2011 numerous insurance claims reaching  65million by early november were made following hurricane igor s landfall over the course of the recovery phase several complaints including concerns lodged by church ministers that relief funds for victims of the storm were not being distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long roughly ten months after the hurricane work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the burin peninsula by january 24 2011  received about  1.6million worth of donations for residents affected by hurricane igor roughly half of which had been distributed at that point an additional  200,000 had been pledged by donors 



many rivers and streams across newfoundland surpassed their banks washing out adjacent terrain 

in june2011 a federal document detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents affected by the storm the main complaint raised was related to the delay in accepting federal aid despite the severity of the damage in an email sent on september21 2010 denys doiron the nation s emergency preparedness and response officer relayed that local emergency services reported igor to be the worst disaster they have had to deal with doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made nearly a year after the passage of igor a  from st john s was spotted near the  north of  on september12 2011 in early october newfoundland was again struck by a tropical cyclone  though a weaker storm ophelia caused more damage than expected as it destroyed infrastructure repaired in the wake of igor the mayor of marystown criticized government officials for not increasing the size of repairs especially to culverts to account for flooding retirement
