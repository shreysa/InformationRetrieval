hurricane iris was the ninth  and fifth hurricane of the  iris was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect the  in a three-week period preceding the more destructive hurricanes  and  it developed from a  to the east of the lesser antilles on august22 and attained hurricane status within 30hours the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the islands of the eastern caribbean from august26 through august28 during that time iris became one of four active tropical storms in the atlantic basin earlier it had interacted with  and beginning on august30 iris interacted with tropical storm karen iris re-intensified into a hurricane and attained peak  of 110mph  175km h  while moving slowly across the central atlantic the hurricane accelerated to the north and absorbed a dissipating tropical depression karen on september3 iris weakened to a tropical storm and became  on september4 though its remnants reattained hurricane-force winds before affecting western europe on september7 as a tropical storm iris produced heavy rainfall across much of the  in the southern lesser antilles high waves caused coastal flooding in  while in  further north significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides the threat from the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on  which was being threatened by the eruption of the  volcano there were five deaths in association with irisfour in martinique and one in

on august28 iris moved away from the lesser antilles and at 1800utc re-attained hurricane status as it began a steady motion to the north-northwest by that time there was uncertainty in its future track due to the possible interactions among iris humberto to the northeast tropical storm karen to the southeast and the remnants of  to the west in addition after  formed on august27 there were four active tropical cyclones in the atlantic a few days later there were three simultaneous hurricanes which is a rare event when luis attained hurricane status on august30 iris turned to the northeast while it began interacting directly with tropical storm karen over the next few days the smaller tropical storm moved around the larger circulation of iris potentially causing the hurricane to move erratically iris  intensity did not change significantly during that time and it maintained strong  but a weak eyewall an eastward-moving trough bypassed the storm to the north causing the motion to become nearly stationary a building  to the northeast caused iris to turn to a northwest drift on september1 by that time the eye had become distinct and well-organized and at 0600utc that day iris attained peak winds of 110mph  175km h  to the southeast of bermuda after reaching peak intensity the hurricane began weakening due to increasing shear and cooler waters an approaching trough turned iris to the north and early on september3 the hurricane passed about 350mi  560km  east of bermuda that day iris absorbed the dissipating tropical depression karen it accelerated to the northeast as it lost tropical characteristics and after weakening to a tropical storm iris transitioned into an  on september4 to the southeast of  the remnants turned to the east moving in tandem with an extratropical storm to its north on september5 the  dropped by more than 24 millibars  0.71inhg  which qualified as being classified as a meteorological  the next day the winds strengthened to hurricane-status and the storm maintained a track to the east due to a ridge weakening to the north the pressure reached a minimum of 957mb  28.3inhg  early on september7 lower than while iris was tropical that day the storm weakened as it entered the  and the extratropical remnants continued across western europe preparations and impact

before iris moved through the   and later warnings were issued from  through the  the storm produced tropical storm force winds across the eastern caribbean although the primary meteorological event occurred from heavy rainfall flooding prompted evacuations in communities in saint lucia dominica and saint vincent and the grenadines iris was the first of three storms in a three-week period to affect the region preceding the more destructive hurricanes  and  in western  a feeder produced winds of 37mph  60km h  along the  the winds increased waves that caused coastal flooding and some damage to boats on  iris produced gusts of 56mph  90km h  with torrential rainfall occurring on the island a station in  recorded 1.89in  48mm  in a 30minute period and the highest total on the island was 17.72in  450mm  at  the rains caused mudslides that killed four people including two after a house was swept off a cliff in  flooding was reported across coastal areas of martinique and heavy damage was reported in the southern city of  to the north of martinique winds reached 43mph  69km h  on dominica while the storm passed  it produced sustained winds of 45mph  72km h  with gusts to 65mph  105km h  on  there was one death on the island after a person drowned in a storm-flooded river to the northwest the hurricane moved over  causing additional problems on the island just weeks after the  volcano began erupting officials on the island closed the  due to the storm which prevented residents from evacuating from the island from the volcano threat further north iris dropped 6in  150mm  of rain on  which destroyed banana trees and caused flooding in low-lying areas due to uncertainties in iris  track the government of  issued a tropical storm watch on september1 this was downgraded on september3 after the hurricane bypassed the island later after iris became extratropical the storm produced winds of 45mph  72km h  at  on the atlantic coast of  see also
