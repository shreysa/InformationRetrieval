hurricane stan originated from a  that was first identified by the   nhc  off the west coast of africa on september17 2005 traveling westward the wave remained weak barely being notable by september22  began to increase  however  in the region prevented this development from continuing the system entered the  several days later a region with more favorable conditions for cyclonic development intermittent convection formed around the wave as it moved west-northwestward before the development maintained itself on october1 the system had become sufficiently organized for the nhc to classify it as tropical depression twenty with the center of circulation situated roughly 135mi  215km  southeast of   located to the south of a low to mid-level   the depression tracked towards the west-northwest within a few hours of being warned upon the system further intensified into tropical storm stan this followed the development of a strong  to the southeast of the storm s center around 1000  5a.m   on october2 stan made its first landfall near  mexico roughly 35mi  55km  south of  with winds of 40mph  65km h  over the following 18hours the weak storm traversed the southern portion of the  upon entering the  on october3 stan had weakened to a tropical depression  however convection began to redevelop over the storm s center allowing the system to re-attain tropical storm status

a strong area of high pressure over the western gulf of mexico forced the storm to turn southwestward back to the mexican coastline increasingly deep cloud cover formed over the storm in response to a favorable environment over the  late on october3 forecasters at national hurricane center noted a statistical rapid intensity index indicating a 49 chance of stan undergoing  before its final landfall this intensification did take place within 12hours before the hurricane moved onshore overnight the structure of stan rapidly improved with a  developing within unusually deep convection with cloud-top temperatures measured at 90c  130f  by  satellites following this development national hurricane center upgraded the storm to a  on the  around 1200utc on october4 stan made landfall near punta roca partida with winds of 80mph  130km h  the storm also attained its lowest  of 977mbar  hpa  28.85inhg at this time not long after moving over the mountainous terrain of central mexico stan rapidly weakened to a tropical depression and fully dissipated early on october5 over the state of  preparations 
some 100,000 inhabitants of the  region on the gulf coast were evacuated from their homes and incidents of mild flooding as well as wind damage  such as uprooted trees and roofs ripped off houses  were reported from coastal areas of  including the      and  as well as state capital  further inland the  evacuated the inhabitants of a dozen or so towns on the coastal plain between   in the west and the lakeside resort of  in the east impact 

around the time of stan s existence torrential rainstorms dropped upwards of 20inches  500mm  of rain causing severe flash floods mud slides and crop damage  particularly to the  crop which was close to harvest  over portions of mexico and central america including     and  most of the rainstorms were non-tropical in nature and impossible to relate to the hurricane  however the impact of the larger weather system can be considered as a whole hundreds were reported missing and were feared dead throughout the region one estimate put the death toll above 2,000 in  alone the final death toll will likely never be known due to the extensive decomposition of bodies in the  note that only 80-100 of the deaths were estimated to have been as a result of stan  the rest were not caused by stan itself but were the result of the large system of non-tropical rains that had spawned the hurricane most of the reported fatalities were as a result of the flooding and mudslides although eight of the deaths in  were as a result of a boat carrying migrants from  and  that ran ashore a large portion of the figure comes from one village alone as a mudslide completely destroyed the village of  in guatemala s  mexico 
as a tropical storm stan brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the  flash flooding took place in several areas  however no loss of life was reported
