communicating sequential processes this paper suggests that input and output are basic primitives of programming and that parallel composition of communicating sequential processes is a fundamental program structuring method when combined with a development of dijkstras guarded command these concepts are surprisingly versatile their use is illustrated by sample solutions of a variety of familiar programming exercises cacm August, 1978 Hoare, C.
