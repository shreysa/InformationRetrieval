the clockwise direction


 can occur in two possible directions a clockwise  typically abbreviated as cw  motion is one that proceeds in the same direction as a  s hands  from the top to the right then down and then to the left and back up to the top the opposite sense of  or  is  in   counterclockwise  ccw  or  in   anticlockwise  acw

terminology 
before clocks were commonplace the terms   and  deasil   deiseil  and even  deocil  from the  language and from the same root as the latin  dexter   right  were used for clockwise   or  withershins   from   weddersinnes   opposite course  was used for counterclockwise 




the counterclockwise or anticlockwise direction


the terms clockwise and counterclockwise can only be applied to a rotational motion once a side of the rotational plane is specified from which the rotation is observed for example the daily rotation of the  is clockwise when viewed from above the  and counterclockwise when viewed from above the  clocks traditionally follow this sense of rotation because of the clock s predecessor  the  clocks with hands were first built in the northern hemisphere  see   and they were made to work like sundials in order for a horizontal sundial to work  in the northern hemisphere  it must be placed looking northward then when the  moves in the sky  east to south to west  the shadow cast on the opposite side of the sundial moves with the same sense of rotation  west to north to east  this is why hours were drawn in sundials in that manner and why modern clocks have their numbers set in the same way note however that on a vertical sundial  such as those placed on the walls of buildings  the shadow moves in the opposite direction and some clocks were constructed to mimic this the best-known surviving example is the astronomical clock in the  whose hands move counterclockwise occasionally clocks whose hands revolve counterclockwise are nowadays sold as a novelty historically some  clocks were built that way for example in some synagogue towers in europe to accord with right-to-left reading in the   in 2014 under  president  the clock outside the legislative assembly in   was shifted to counterclockwise motion to promote indigenous values usage

typical     and jar lids are tightened  moved away from the observer  clockwise and loosened  moved towards the observer  counterclockwise in accordance with the  to apply the right-hand rule place one s loosely clenched right hand above the object with the thumb pointing in the direction one wants the screw nut bolt or cap ultimately to move and the curl of the fingers from the palm to the tips will indicate in which way one needs to turn the screw nut bolt or cap to achieve the desired result almost all threaded objects obey this rule except for a few left-handed exceptions described below the reason for the clockwise standard for most screws and bolts is that  of the arm which is used by a right-handed person to tighten a screw clockwise is generally stronger than  used to loosen sometimes the opposite  left-handed counterclockwise reverse  sense of threading is used for a special reason a thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it for example some older  and trucks had right-handed  on the right wheels and left-handed ones on the left wheels so that as the vehicle moved forward the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen for  the one on the left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use similarly the  of a  uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening a  has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections  oxygen fittings are right-handed but   and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings mathematics 
in  and  in general plane  are conventionally measured counterclockwise starting with 0 or 0  pointing directly to the right  or east  and 90 pointing straight up  or north  however in   headings increase clockwise around the compass face starting with 0 at the top of the compass  the northerly direction  with 90 to the right  east  a circle defined parametrically in a  by the equations x   cos t and y   sin t is traced counterclockwise as the angle t increases in value from the right-most point at t   0 an alternative formulation with sin and cos swapped gives a clockwise trace from the upper-most point games and activities 
in general most card games board games parlor games and multiple team sports play in a clock-wise turn rotation in western countries and latin america with a notable resistance to playing in the opposite direction  counter-clockwise  traditionally  and still continued for the most part  turns pass counter-clockwise in many asian countries in western countries when speaking and discussion activities take part in a circle turns tend to naturally pass in a clockwise motion even though there is no obligation to do so curiously unlike with games there is usually no objection when the activity uncharacteristically begins in a counter-clockwise motion notably the game of baseball is played counter-clockwise in humans 
most left-handed people prefer to draw circles and circulate in buildings clockwise while most right-handed people prefer to draw circles and circulate in buildings counterclockwise this is believed to result from dominant brain hemispheres though some attribute it to muscle mechanics see also
