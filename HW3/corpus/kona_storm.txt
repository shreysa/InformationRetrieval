origin of term 
kona is a  term  related to similar words in other  languages  for the western  to southwestern  side of an island the  for example on the  still uses this name although normally dry and  the traditional easterly  to northeasterly   slacken and reverse during one of these cyclones character of the cyclones 
once termed as  a change in the definition of the term during the early 1970s makes categorization of the systems not straightforward kona lows are typically cold core making them  however they generally share the subtropical cyclone characteristic of losing their associated  with time since the cyclones tend to retrograde slowly otkin and martin identified three types of kona storms  cold-frontal cyclogenesis cyclones  cfcs  trade wind easterlies and cold-frontal cyclogenesis trade wind easterlies cyclones of the three cfc cyclones are the most common rainfall in a kona storm is more pronounced than a  and most intense from south to east of the storm and in front of the storm s center steady rains may last from several hours to days with longer lasting storms typically interrupted by intervals of lighter rain and partial clearing intense showers may appear on more moderate but steady rain frequency and effects 
some winters occur without a single kona storm with a high of four or five hawaii typically experiences two to three annually between october and april the cyclone events for hawaii can be long-lived affecting the state for a week or more kona lows produce a wide range of weather hazards for hawaii among them are heavy rain hailstorms flash floods and their associated landslides high winds which result in large surf and swells waterspouts and heavy snows on the higher mountains kona winds 
kona winds are associated with cyclones with central pressures below 1,000.0 hectopascals  29.53inhg  which pass within 500miles 820km northwest of the hawaiian islands strong kona winds usually last for a day considerable damage is caused to boats lying southwest of the islands on land trees are uprooted and roofs can be blown off homes when passing through mountain gaps and over mountains downsloped winds gust over 100mph 165km h which causes much of the destruction examples 




a kona storm on november 4 1995


the most powerful kona storm in the last fifty years struck the hawaiian islands between 8 january and 11 january 1980 the low pressure primarily responsible for the severe conditions had a barometric pressure of 975mb on january 8 while passing north of the state one of the lowest pressure readings ever recorded in hawaiian waters as a result of an extratropical storm the storm caused severe weather across the entire state forcing the closure of all airports rainfall from the storm was extremely heavy surpassing twenty inches in many locations particularly on the big island and maui high surf from the storm caused extensive damage particularly along the kona coast of the big island where the towns of kailua-kona and puako received extensive damage winds from the storm averaged around 40-50mph on the open ocean but varied tremendously on land due to unique geographic features some areas experienced wind gusts well over hurricane force including a low altitude gust of 106mph  171km h  on lahaina roads maui haiku on the windward coast of maui experienced a wind gust of 75mph  121km h  on the high mountain summits of the big island and maui winds of over 110mph  180km h  were recorded damage from the storm was estimated at between  25 and 35 million  in 1980 dollars  in december 2008 lightning strikes from a kona storm caused the entire power grid of the island of oahu to black out while then president-elect  was visiting in december2010 a kona storm became fully subtropical and eventually became  in popular culture
