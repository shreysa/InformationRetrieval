hurricane lenny began as a  that was first observed in the southwestern caribbean sea on november8 it developed an area of  but remained poorly defined for the next few days thunderstorms spread across the region producing heavy rainfall in portions of mexico and central america on november13 the system became better organized  a  flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and  of about 35mph  56km h  the data indicated the  of tropical depression sixteen at 1800 about 175mi  282km  south of the  the depression s convection was fairly disorganized and the   nhc  did not anticipate any strengthening for three days for much of its existence the  maintained a track from west to east across the caribbean sea which was unprecedented in the  earning it the nickname  left-hand lenny  the path resulted from its movement along the southern end of a  over the western atlantic ocean after its formation the depression gradually became better organized  the nhc upgraded it to tropical storm lenny on november14 based on reports from the hurricane hunters when it was first upgraded to a tropical storm the cyclone already had winds of 65mph  105km h  and a developing  at 0000utc on november15 lenny attained hurricane status about 175mi  282km  southwest of  the quick intensification was unexpected and occurred after a large area of convection blossomed over the center at the same time lenny developed an  aloft which provided favorable conditions for the hurricane s development after moving east-southeastward during its initial development stages the hurricane turned more to the east on november15 the hurricane hunters reported winds of 100mph  160km h  which indicated that lenny had become a category2 on the  however the cloud pattern subsequently became less organized as the eye disappeared and lenny s winds weakened to 85mph  137km h  while the hurricane passed south of hispaniola the nhc noted the deterioration could have been due to a disruption of the storm s small inner core by  subtle environmental changes  after the sudden weakening the hurricane hunters reported that the eye had reformed and the hurricane s winds had reached 100mph  160km h  at the time a  was expected to build to lenny s east and turn the storm northeastward into  24hours later beginning on november16 hurricane lenny underwent a 24-hour period of  reaching major hurricane status about 165mi  266km  south of the  it developed well-defined  good  and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in  the hurricane continued to become better organized with an eye 29mi  47km  in diameter surrounded by a closed eyewall around 1200utc on november17 lenny intensified into a category4 hurricane while approaching the islands of the northeastern caribbean it was the fifth storm of such intensity in the year setting the record for most category4 hurricanes in a season the hurricane then made its closest approach to puerto rico passing about 75mi  121km  southeast of  shortly thereafter lenny attained peak winds of 155mph  249km h  while passing 21mi  34km  south of the island of  in the  this made it the second-strongest hurricane on record to form during the month of november hurricane hunters reported lenny s peak winds in the southeastern portion of the hurricane  the group also reported a minimum  of 933 a drop of 34mbar in 24hours in addition a  recorded winds of 210mph  340km h  while descending to the surface the highest dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the time around the time it peaked in intensity lenny s forward speed decreased in response to light  between two ridges despite favorable conditions for strengthening the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift possibly due to the  of cooler waters late on november18 lenny s eye moved over  with winds of 125mph  201km h  after continued weakening the hurricane struck  and  the next day it turned southeastward while still drifting bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands across the northeastern caribbean late on november19 lenny weakened to tropical storm intensity after increased  exposed the cyclone s center from the deepest convection early on november20 the storm made landfall on anguilla although by then the center had become difficult to locate later that day the cyclone exited the caribbean continuing its southeast track on november21 lenny turned to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression the deep convection was located at least 100mi  160km  east of the increasingly elongated center lenny turned to the east for the final time early on november22 dissipating the next day about 690mi  1,110km  east of the lesser antilles preparations
