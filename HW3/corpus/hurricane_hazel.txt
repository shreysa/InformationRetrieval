this article is about the atlantic hurricane of 1954 for other storms with the same name see  for the canadian politician nicknamed  hurricane hazel  see  
hurricane hazel was the deadliest and costliest  of the  the storm killed at least 400people in  before striking the united states near the border between  and  as a  after causing 95fatalities in the us hazel struck canada as an  storm raising the death toll by 81people mostly in  as a result of the high death toll and the damage caused by hazel its name was  from use for  in haiti hazel destroyed 40%of the coffee trees and 50%of the cacao crop affecting the economy for several years to come the hurricane made landfall near calabash north carolina and destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of impact from north carolina it traveled north along the atlantic coast hazel affected  washington d.c      and   it brought gusts near 160km h  100mph  and caused  281million  1954   in damage when it was over pennsylvania hazel consolidated with a cold front and turned northwest towards canada when it hit ontario as an extratropical storm rivers and streams in and around toronto overflowed their banks which caused severe flooding as a result many residential areas located in the local floodplains such as the  area were subsequently converted to parkland in canada alone over 135million  2016   1.2billion  of damage was incurred the effects of hazel were particularly unprecedented in toronto due to a combination of heavy rainfall during the preceding weeks a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm s unexpected retention of power hazel had traveled 1,100km  680mi  over land but while approaching canada it had merged with an existing powerful cold front the storm stalled over the greater toronto area and although it was now extratropical it remained as powerful as a category1 hurricane to help with the cleanup 800members of the military were summoned and a hurricane relief fund was established that distributed  5.1million  2009   41.7million  in aid

the weston golf club was left submerged after the  overflowed its banks during hurricane hazel in  

after affecting the bahamas hazel accelerated northwest toward the southeastern united states steered between a trough and a ridge hurricanes are generally expected to lose power after going north of florida due to lower water temperatures however hazel restrengthened as it tracked northward over the  the hurricane hunters were unable to observe the core of the storm until it neared land reporting an eye 18mi  33km  in diameter on october15 later that day a ship just offshore south carolina reported a central pressure of 938mbar  27.7inhg  which was the lowest in association with the hurricane at 15 30utc on october15 hazel made landfall just west of the north carolina south carolina border with a 40mi  64km  eye slightly northeast of  in the latter state based on the pressure a larger than average size and the fast forward movement the landfall intensity was estimated at 130mph  215km h  or a category4 on the  the eye of hazel was tracked across several towns in north carolina as the system continued northward at 18 00utc on october15 the hurricane became  near  and within six hours had passed near  the extratropical remnants of hazel accelerated to the north through pennsylvania and new york along an extended  despite widespread observations across the eastern united states there was uncertainty in the track of hazel as an extratropical storm although it was possible the original circulation dissipated over western pennsylvania and a new one formed over western new york the atlantic hurricane reanalysis assessed the circulation as becoming elongated but continuous on october16 the storm crossed into  and over the  region shortly thereafter the former hurricane hazel dropped to gale-force winds after moving almost 1,000km  620mi  over land the storm slowed and turned northward passing over  early on october17 after turning to the northeast the remnants of hazel were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over canada on october18 preparations 
on october 6 small craft warnings were issued for the dutch islands of   and  despite predictions that hazel would pass to the north  these warnings were canceled a day later after the storm had turned northward tropical cyclone warnings were posted for haiti the dominican republic and the waters of the  small craft near jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm the u.s navy completed extensive preparations at its  ordering about 1,000 civilians into hardened fortified  flying aircraft out of the storm s path and positioning  out at sea then on october 14 the national weather bureau issued a warning for the  with the caveat that the worst of the hurricane was expected to stay offshore instead the storm took a sharp northwest turn and headed toward land by evening of the same day the storm was forecast to make landfall near the carolinas border further forecasts expected hazel to lose its power and dissipate over the  in her book hurricane hazel canadian journalist  argued that in canada the impressions that hazel was  the best-kept secret in town  and that it was a  fully documented meteorological event that should have taken nobody by surprise  both  paradoxically    contain a great deal of truth  meteorologists predicted that if hazel merged with the cold front the storm would not lose intensity but would instead potentially strengthen two special weather bulletins were issued by the dominion weather office but since it was expected that the storm would pass east of  few other warnings were given and there were no evacuations which increased the eventual property damage and loss of life the forecast called for high winds between 65km h  40mph  and 80km h  50mph  with only occasional showers on lakes  and  ships received warnings of strong winds and the predicted wind speeds ranged from 65km h  40mph  to 120km h  75mph   had called in standby crews as heavy winds were forecast although they were almost sent home at one point due to a lull in the storm there had been significant rainfall in the toronto area in the two weeks prior to hazel so the ground was already saturated few people in canada had any experience with hurricanes since it was unheard of for them to travel as far north and inland as toronto kennedy also notes that if  toronto had been about to face a blizzard or was threatened by a 14-inch  36-cm  snowfall that  would have been something understandable    this was different this was the unknown the unfamiliar the totally unexpected crisis hurricanes belonged in the tropics

after weeks of unusually high rainfall saturated the  hazel dropped additional rainfall peaking at 8.4in  214mm  in  in three hours the city received 3.5in  90mm  of precipitation most of these rains ran off into rivers and creeks of toronto which raised water levels by as much as 2026ft  68m  not built to withstand heavy flooding toronto s infrastructure took a heavy hit  over 50bridges many parts of important highways as well as numerous roads and railways were destroyed when the high water washed them out or carried debris and smashed them floodwaters slowly rose in   a bowl-shaped valley near   allowing people to escape to the town  which passes through the marsh was under as much as 10ft  3m  of water in some places when as much 6m  20ft  of water backed up much of the crops in the area were either swept away or ruined after the water pumps failed due to debris better equipment allowed the holland marsh to be drained by november 13 the  in the west end of toronto caused the most destruction as a result of an intense flash flood after most minor rivers and creeks drained into it a team of five volunteer firefighters were killed when their fire truck was swept away as they were responding to help a stranded motorist communities in the humber floodplain were devastated at woodbridge the river swelled from its usual width of 20m  66ft  at its narrowest point to 107m  351ft  and left hundreds homeless and nine dead the humber swept away 366m  1,201ft  of  and 14nearby homes killing 35people out of the 81canadian fatalities the rise of the river was unprecedented and the residents did not evacuate which led to the high death toll the  also overflowed its banks at the village of long branch killing seven people after many dwellings were swept into lake ontario the death toll of 81 people has not since been equaled by a natural disaster in canada in addition to the casualties over 4,000 families were left homeless the department of public safety and emergency preparedness canada estimates the total cost of hurricane hazel for canada taking into account long-term effects such as economic disruption the cost of lost property and recovery costs to be 137,552,400 aftermath
in the aftermath of hazel a three-day period of national mourning was declared in haiti for hurricane victims with existing infrastructure already poor the recovery was very slow since many of the few existing roads were blocked and communications equipment was either out damaged or destroyed the haitian red cross appealed for assistance to the international red cross while the american red cross made a donation of  25,000  1954 usd   offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid and the us aircraft carrier  deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies despite the relief effort there was an outbreak of  following hazel due to a lack of clean water united states 
in the carolinas the national guard was mobilised by the evening of october 15 to prevent looting along affected areas of the coastline on october 17 president  declared a  major disaster  in the carolinas and offered  immediate and unlimited federal assistance  recovery was quick and by october 24 all but two units were demobilised another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts an artificial sand dune barrier 39km  24mi  long was completed by october 30 which in the long run led to a more rapid natural build-up of larger dunes with myrtle beach a popular tourist destination the chamber of commerce began an information campaign to inform the public which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed that the city would be ready for the coming summer the rebuilding after the partial destruction would transform myrtle beach from a  quaint summer colony to a high-rise resort city  canada

a  was built on the humber river near raymore drive to lessen the risk of a similar catastrophic flood 

the army sent about 800soldiers to toronto to assist with the cleanup providing blankets and mattresses toronto residents helped out with the relief effort  the  received so many donations of clothes footwear blankets food and money that its storage facilities were overfilled forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed a hurricane relief fund was established to coordinate financial donations ultimately raising about  5.3million  cad  the fund received donations from organisations companies and individuals including  the  the   and the  a portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses the  was created after the storm to manage the area s floodplains and rivers such as building dams the heavily flooded areas were expropriated and barred from rebuilding homes and most of the land was later converted into an extensive park system along toronto s rivers a footbridge dedicated to the victims crosses the humber river in raymore park which was the former raymore drive retirement 
as a result of the catastrophic damage and severe death tolls in the caribbean united states and canada the name hazel was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane however since it was retired before the inception of naming lists with the modern six-year cycle it was not directly replaced with any particular name see also 










 a similar storm in 2012 with an unusual and complicated track due to   a storm which took a similar track in the caribbean in 2016
