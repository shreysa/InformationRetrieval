origin of the name
despite its name most of rhode island is located on the mainland of the united states its official name is state of rhode island and providence plantations which is derived from the merger of four colonial settlements the settlements of  and  were situated on what is commonly called  today but it was called rhode island in colonial times  was the name of the colony founded by  in the area now known as the city of  this was adjoined by the settlement of   hence the plural providence plantations it is unclear how aquidneck island came to be known as rhode island but two historical events may have influenced the name 
explorer  noted the presence of an island near the mouth of narragansett bay in 1524 which he likened to the island of   part of modern greece  subsequent european explorers were unable to precisely identify the island that verrazzano had named but the pilgrims who later colonized the area assumed that it was aquidneck  passed by aquidneck during his expeditions in the 1610s and he described it in a 1625 account of his travels as  an island of reddish appearance  which was  een rodlich eylande  in 17th-century dutch and one popular notion is that this dutch phrase might have influenced the name rhode island  historians have theorized that this  reddish appearance  resulted from either red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore

the earliest documented use of the name  rhode island  for aquidneck was in 1637 by roger williams the name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words   aquethneck shall be henceforth called the isle of rodes or rhode-island  the name  isle of rodes  is used in a legal document as late as 1646 dutch maps as early as 1659 call the island  red island   roodt eylant  roger williams was a theologian who was forced out of the massachusetts bay colony seeking religious and political tolerance he and others founded providence plantation as a free proprietary colony  providence  referred to the concept of  and  plantation  was an english   state of rhode island and providence plantations  is the longest official name of any state in the union 2009 contestation of the name
in recent years the presence of the word plantation in the state s name became a sufficiently contested issue that the  voted on june 25 2009 to hold a general referendum determining whether  and providence plantations  would be dropped from the official name advocates for excising plantation asserted that the word symbolized an alleged legacy of native disenfranchisement for many rhode islanders as well as the proliferation of slavery in the colonies and in the post-colonial united states  rhode island abolished slavery in 1652 but the law was not enforced and by the early 18th century it was  the epicenter of the north american slave trade  according to the brown daily herald  advocates for retaining the name argued that plantation was simply an archaic synonym for  and bore no relation to slavery the referendum election was held on november 2 2010 and the people voted overwhelmingly  78 to 22  to retain the entire original name geography
