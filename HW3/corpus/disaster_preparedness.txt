emergency management is the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergenciespreparedness response and recoveryin order to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards including disasters often interchanged with disaster management it is not be confused with it the world health organization defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state turning into a disaster thus emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a disaster which is harder to recover from

emergency planning ideals 

if possible emergency planning should aim to prevent emergencies from occurring and failing that should develop a good action plan to mitigate the results and effects of any emergencies as time goes on and more data becomes available usually through the study of emergencies as they occur a plan should evolve the development of emergency plans is a cyclical process common to many risk management disciplines such as business continuity and security risk management as set out below 

recognition or identification of risks
ranking or evaluation of risks
responding to significant risks
tolerate
treat
transfer
terminate
resourcing controls and planning
reaction planning
reporting   monitoring risk performance
reviewing the risk management framework

there are a number of guidelines and publications regarding emergency planning published by various professional organizations such as asis national fire protection association  nfpa  and the international association of emergency managers  iaem  there are very few emergency management specific standards and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standards in order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks hopefully to reduce their probability of occurring in the event that an emergency does occur managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations post-incident it is essential for an organisation to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be activated implementation ideals 

an emergency plan must be regularly maintained in a structured and methodical manner to ensure it is up-to-date in the event of an emergency emergency managers generally follow a common process to anticipate assess prevent prepare respond and recover from an incident pre-incident training and testing 




a team of emergency responders performs a training scenario involving  

emergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs training plans should include internal people contractors and civil protection partners and should state the nature and frequency of training and testing testing of a plan s effectiveness should occur regularly in instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space joint emergency plans formally agreed to by all parties should be put into place drills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency and people who will be affected drills are held to prepare for the hazards of    for protection  etc communicating and incident assessment 
communication is one of the key issues during any emergency pre-planning of communications is critical miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarily once an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken following assessment the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan the steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible the critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalized the communication policy must be well known and rehearsed and all targeted audiences or publics and individuals must be alert all communication infrastructure must be as prepared as possible with all information on groupings clearly identified phases and personal activities 

emergency management consists of five phases  prevention mitigation preparedness response and recovery 
prevention 
it focuses on preventing the human hazard primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels designed to provide permanent protection from disasters also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans environmental planning and design standards in january 2005 167 governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the  
preventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery public safety canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach in 2009 federal provincial territorial ministers endorsed a national disaster mitigation strategy mitigation strategy 
disaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs preventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters in earthquake prone areas these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an  to instantly shut off the natural gas supply  of property and the securing of items inside a building the latter may include the mounting of furniture   and breakables to the walls and the addition of cabinet latches in flood prone areas houses can be built on poles stilts in areas prone to prolonged electricity  installation of a  ensures continuation of electrical service the construction of  and  are further examples of personal mitigative actions on a national level governments might implement large scale mitigation measures after the monsoon floods of 2010 the punjab government subsequently constructed 22  disaster-resilient  model villages comprising 1885 single-storey homes together with schools and health centres one of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the red river floodway the building of the floodway was a joint provincial federal undertaking to protect the city of winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the red river basin it cost  62.7 million to build in the 1960s since then the floodway has been used over 20 times its use during the 1997 red river flood alone saved an estimated  4.5 billion in costs from potential damage to the city the floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincial federal initiative preparedness

preparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a  occurs this equipment and these procedures can be used to reduce vulnerability to disaster to mitigate the impacts of a disaster or to respond more efficiently in an  the   fema  has set out a basic four-stage vision of preparedness flowing from mitigation to preparedness to response to recovery and back to mitigation in a circular planning process this circular overlapping model has been modified by other agencies taught in emergency class and discussed in academic papers fema also operates a building science branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property fema advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted fema has subsequently prepared for this contingency by purchasing hundreds of thousands of freeze dried food emergency meals ready to eat  mre s  to dispense to the communities where emergency shelter and evacuations are implemented some guidelines for household preparedness have been put online by the state of colorado on the topics of water food tools and so on emergency preparedness can be difficult to measure cdc focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of its public health efforts through a variety of measurement and assessment programs local emergency planning committees 
  lepcs  are required by the  under the  to develop an emergency response plan review the plan at least annually and provide information about chemicals in the community to local citizens this emergency preparedness effort focuses on hazards presented by use and storage of extremely hazardous and toxic chemicals particular requirements of lepcs include

identification of facilities and transportation routes of extremely hazardous substances
description of emergency response procedures on and off site
designation of a community coordinator and facility emergency coordinator s  to implement the plan
outline of emergency notification procedures
description of how to determine the probable affected area and population by releases
description of local emergency equipment and facilities and the persons responsible for them
outline of evacuation plans
a training program for emergency responders  including schedules 
methods and schedules for exercising emergency response plans

according to the epa  many lepcs have expanded their activities beyond the requirements of epcra encouraging accident prevention and risk reduction and addressing homeland security in their communities  and the agency offers advice on how to evaluate the effectiveness of these committees preparedness measures 

preparedness measures can take many forms ranging from focusing on individual people locations or incidents to broader government-based  all hazard  planning there are a number of preparedness stages between  all hazard  and individual planning generally involving some combination of both mitigation and response planning business continuity planning encourages businesses to have a  community and faith-based organizations mitigation efforts promote field response teams and inter-agency planning

disasters take a variety of forms to include   or regular  that a disaster or emergency is not large scale in terms of population or acreage impacted or duration does not make it any less of a disaster for the people or area impacted and much can be learned about preparedness from so-called small disasters the red cross states that it responds to nearly 70,000 disasters a year the most common of which is a single family fire

preparedness starts with an individual s  and involves items and training that would be useful in an emergency what is useful in an emergency is often also useful in everyday life from personal preparedness preparedness continues on a continuum through family preparedness community preparedness and then business non-profit and governmental preparedness some organizations blend these various levels for example the  has a webpage on disaster training as well as offering training on basic preparedness such as  and  other non-profits such as  bring specific groups of people into disaster preparedness and response operations fema breaks down preparedness into a pyramid with citizens on the foundational bottom on top of which rests local government state government and federal government in that order

the basic theme behind preparedness is to be ready for an emergency and there are a number of different variations of being ready based on an assessment of what sort of threats exist nonetheless there is basic guidance for preparedness that is common despite an area s specific dangers fema recommends that everyone have a three-day survival kit for their household because individual household sizes and specific needs might vary fema s recommendations are not item specific but the list includes 

three-day supply of non-perishable food three-day supply of water  one gallon of water per person per day portable battery-powered radio or television and extra batteries flashlight and extra batteries first aid kit and manual  and  items  e.g    matches and waterproof container whistle extra clothing kitchen accessories and cooking utensils including a can opener photocopies of credit and identification cards cash and coins special needs items such as prescription medications eyeglasses contact lens solutions and hearing aid batteries items for infants such as formula diapers bottles and pacifiers other items to meet unique family needs

children are a special population when considering emergency preparedness and many resources are directly focused on supporting them samhsa has list of tips for talking to children during infectious disease outbreaks to include being a good listener encouraging children to ask questions and modeling self-care by setting routines eating healthy meals getting enough sleep and taking deep breaths to handle stress fema has similar advice noting that  disasters can leave children feeling frightened confused and insecure  whether a child has experienced it first hand had it happen to a friend or simply saw it on television in the same publication fema further notes  preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters do happen and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources needed to meet basic needs after disaster preparation helps  when people feel prepared they cope better and so do children 
to help people assess what threats might be in order to augment their emergency supplies or improve their disaster response skills fema has published a booklet called the  threat and hazard identification and risk assessment guide   thira  this guide which outlines the thira process emphasizes  whole community involvement  not just governmental agencies in preparedness efforts in this guide fema breaks down hazards into three categories  natural technological and human caused and notes that each hazard should be assessed for both its likelihood and its significance according to fema  communities should consider only those threats and hazards that could plausibly occur  and  communities should consider only those threats and hazards that would have a significant effect on them  to develop threat and hazard context descriptions communities should take into account the time place and conditions in which threats or hazards might occur not all preparedness efforts and discussions involve the government or established ngos like the red cross emergency preparation discussions are active on the internet with many blogs and websites dedicated to discussing various aspects of preparedness on-line sales of items such as survival food medical supplies and heirloom seeds allow people to stock basements with cases of food and drinks with 25 year shelf lives sophisticated medical kits and seeds that are guaranteed to sprout even after years of storage one group of people who put a lot of effort in disaster preparations is called  this subset of preparedness-minded people often share a belief that the fema or red cross emergency preparation suggestions and training are not extensive enough sometimes called  doomsday preppers are often preparing for the end of the world as we know it abbreviated as teotwawki with a motto some have that  the future belongs to those who prepare  this preparedness subset has its own set of murphy s rules including  rule number 1  food you still don t have enough  and  rule number 26  people who thought the government would save them found out that it didn t 
not all emergency preparation efforts revolve around food guns and shelters though these items help address the needs in the bottom two sections of  the american preppers network has an extensive list of items that might be useful in less apparent ways than a first aid kid or help add  fun  to challenging times these items include 

books and magazines

emergency preparedness goes beyond immediate family members for many people pets are an integral part of their families and emergency preparation advice includes them as well it is not unknown for pet owners to die while trying to rescue their pets from a fire or from drowning cdc s disaster supply checklist for pets includes 

food and water for at least 3 days for each pet  bowls and a manual can opener depending on the pet you may need a litter box paper towels plastic trash bags grooming items and or household bleach medications and medical records stored in a waterproof container first aid kit with a pet first aid book sturdy leash harness and carrier to transport pet safely a carrier should be large enough for the animal to stand comfortably turn around and lie down your pet may have to stay in the carrier for several hours pet toys and the pet s bed if you can easily take it to reduce stress current photos and descriptions of your pets to help others identify them in case you and your pets become separated and to prove that they are yours information on feeding schedules medical conditions behavior problems and the name and telephone number of your veterinarian in case you have to board your pets or place them in foster care 
emergency preparedness also includes more than physical items and skill-specific training psychological preparedness is also a type of emergency preparedness and specific mental health preparedness resources are offered for mental health professionals by organizations such as the red cross these mental health preparedness resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them cdc has a website devoted to coping with a disaster or traumatic event after such an event the cdc through the   samhsa  suggests that people seek psychological help when they exhibit symptoms such as excessive worry crying frequently an increase in irritability anger and frequent arguing wanting to be alone most of the time feeling anxious or fearful overwhelmed by sadness confused having trouble thinking clearly and concentrating and difficulty making decisions increased alcohol and or substance use increased physical  aches pains  complaints such as headaches and trouble with  nerves 
sometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a  while fema does not actually use the term  bug out bag  calling it instead some variation of a  go kit  the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both fema and cdc though on-line discussions of what items a  bug out bag  should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by fema or cdc the theory behind a  bug out bag  is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of  whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane flood or dangerous chemical release rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and fema suggests having a family emergency plan for such occasions because family members may not be together when disaster strikes this plan should include reliable contact information for friends or relatives who live outside of what would be the disaster area for household members to notify they are safe or otherwise communicate with each other along with the contact information fema suggests having well-understood local gathering points if a house must be evacuated quickly to avoid the dangers of re-reentering a burning home family and emergency contact information should be printed on cards and put in each family member s backpack or wallet if family members spend a significant amount of time in a specific location such as at work or school fema suggests learning the emergency preparation plans for those places fema has a specific form in english and in spanish to help people put together these emergency plans though it lacks lines for email contact information like children people with disabilities and other special needs have special emergency preparation needs while  disability  has a specific meaning for specific organizations such as collecting  benefits for the purposes of emergency preparedness the red cross uses the term in a broader sense to include people with physical medical sensor or cognitive disabilities or the elderly and other special needs populations depending on the particular disability specific emergency preparations might be required fema s suggestions for people with disabilities includes having copies of prescriptions charging devices for medical devices such as motorized wheel chairs and a week s supply of medication readily available link or in a  go stay kit  in some instances lack of competency in english may lead to special preparation requirements and communication efforts for both individuals and responders fema notes that long term power outages can cause damage beyond the original disaster that can be mitigated with emergency generators or other power sources to provide an  the  states that  homeowners business owners and local leaders may have to take an active role in dealing with energy disruptions on their own  this active role may include installing or other procuring generators that are either portable or permanently mounted and run on fuels such as propane or natural gas or gasoline concerns about carbon monoxide poisoning electrocution flooding fuel storage and fire lead even small property owners to consider professional installation and maintenance major institutions like hospitals military bases and educational institutions often have or are considering extensive backup power systems instead of or in addition to fuel-based power systems solar wind and other alternative power sources may be used standalone batteries large or small are also used to provide backup charging for electrical systems and devices ranging from emergency lights to computers to cell phones emergency preparedness does not stop at home or at school the  addresses specific emergency preparedness issues hospitals may have to respond to including maintaining a safe temperature providing adequate electricity for life support systems and even carrying out evacuations under extreme circumstances fema encourages all businesses to have businesses to have an emergency response plan and the  specifically advises small business owners to also focus emergency preparedness and provides a variety of different worksheets and resources fema cautions that emergencies happen while people are travelling as well and provides guidance around emergency preparedness for a range travelers to include commuters commuter emergency plan and holiday travelers in particular ready.gov has a number of emergency preparations specifically designed for people with cars these preparations include having a full gas tank maintaining adequate windshield wiper fluid and other basic car maintenance tips items specific to an emergency include 

jumper cables  might want to include flares or reflective triangle
flashlights to include extra batteries  batteries have less power in colder weather 
first aid kit to include any necessary medications baby formula and diapers if caring for small children
non-perishable food such as canned food  be alert to liquids freezing in colder weather  and protein rich foods like nuts and energy bars
manual can opener
at least 1 gallon of water per person a day for at least 3 days  be alert to hazards of frozen water and resultant container rupture

evacuation sign


in a shelter-in-place scenario a family would be prepared to fend for themselves in their home for many days without any form of outside support in an evacuation a family leaves the area by  or other mode of  taking with them the maximum amount of supplies they can carry possibly including a tent for shelter if mechanical transportation is not available evacuation on foot would ideally include carrying at least three days of supplies and rain-tight bedding a  and a bedroll of blankets  are often sought during this period especially for large disasters that overwhelm local capacity due to efficiencies of scale  is often the most cost-effective donation if fraud is avoided money is also the most flexible and if goods are sourced locally then transportation is minimized and the local economy is boosted some donors prefer to send  however these items can end up creating issues rather than helping one innovation by  volunteers is to use a donation registry where families and businesses impacted by the disaster can make specific requests which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site medical considerations will vary greatly based on the type of disaster and secondary effects survivors may sustain a multitude of injuries to include    or  recovery 
the recovery phase starts after the immediate threat to human life has subsided the immediate goal of the recovery phase is to bring the affected area back to normalcy as quickly as possible during reconstruction it is recommended to consider the location or construction material of the property the most extreme home confinement scenarios include war  and severe  and may last a year or more then recovery will take place inside the home planners for these events usually buy  foods and appropriate storage and preparation equipment and eat the food as part of normal life a simple balanced diet can be constructed from  pills  wheat beans  corn and  vegetables fruits spices and meats both prepared and fresh-gardened are included when possible as a profession 

professional emergency managers can focus on government and community preparedness or private business preparedness training is provided by local state federal and private organizations and ranges from public information and media relations to high-level incident command and tactical skills in the past the field of emergency management has been populated mostly by people with a military or first responder background currently the field has become more diverse with many managers coming from a variety of backgrounds other than the military or first responder fields educational opportunities are increasing for those seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees in emergency management or a related field there are over 180 schools in the us with emergency management-related programs but only one doctoral program specifically in emergency management professional certifications such as certified emergency manager  cem  and certified business continuity professional  cbcp  are becoming more common as professional standards are raised throughout the field particularly in the united states there are also professional organizations for emergency managers such as the national emergency management association and the international association of emergency managers principles 
in 2007 dr wayne blanchard of fema s emergency management higher education project at the direction of dr cortez lawrence superintendent of fema s emergency management institute convened a working group of emergency management practitioners and academics to consider principles of emergency management this was the first time the principles of the discipline were to be codified the group agreed on eight principles that will be used to guide the development of a doctrine of emergency management below is a summary 

comprehensive  consider and take into account all hazards all phases all stakeholders and all impacts relevant to disasters progressive  anticipate future disasters and take preventive and preparatory measures to build disaster-resistant and disaster-resilient communities risk-driven  use sound risk management principles  hazard identification risk analysis and impact analysis  in assigning priorities and resources integrated  ensure  among all levels of government and all elements of a community collaborative  create and sustain broad and sincere relationships among individuals and organizations to encourage trust advocate a team atmosphere build consensus and facilitate communication coordinated  synchronize the activities of all relevant stakeholders to achieve a common purpose flexible  use creative and innovative approaches in solving disaster challenges professional  value a science and knowledge-based approach  based on education training experience ethical practice public stewardship and continuous improvement

disaster management in the united states has utilized the functional all-hazards approach for over 20 years in which managers develop processes  such as communication   warning or sheltering  rather than developing single-hazard or threat focused plans  e.g a tornado plan  processes are then mapped to specific hazards or threats with the manager looking for gaps overlaps and conflicts between processes given these notions emergency managers must identify contemplate and assess possible man-made threats and natural threats that may affect their respective locales because of geographical differences throughout the nation a variety of different threats affect communities among the states thus although similarities may exist no two emergency plans will be completely identical additionally each locale has different resources and capacities  e.g budgets personnel equipment etc  for dealing with emergencies each individual community must craft its own unique emergency plan that addresses potential threats that are specific to the locality this creates a plan more resilient to unique events because all common processes are defined and it encourages planning done by the stakeholders who are closer to the individual processes such as a traffic management plan written by a public works director this type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies which require the development of hazard threat specific plans such as the development of specific h1n1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plans in the united states all disasters are initially local with local authorities with usually a police fire or ems agency taking charge many local municipalities may also have a separate dedicated   oem  along with personnel and equipment if the event becomes overwhelming to the local government state emergency management  the primary government structure of the united states  becomes the controlling emergency management agency   fema  part of the   dhs  is the lead federal agency for emergency management the united states and its territories are broken down into ten regions for fema s emergency management purposes fema supports but does not override state authority the  is an organization of volunteer service programs administered locally and coordinated nationally by dhs which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education training and outreach most  is carried out by volunteer organizations in the us the  is chartered by congress to coordinate disaster response services it is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees religious organizations with their ability to provide volunteers quickly are usually integral during the response process the largest being the  with a primary focus on chaplaincy and rebuilding and  who focus on food preparation and distribution as well as cleaning up after floods and fires chaplaincy mobile shower units chainsaw crews and more with over 65,000 trained volunteers southern baptist disaster relief is one of the largest disaster relief organizations in the us similar services are also provided by methodist relief services the lutherans and  unaffiliated volunteers show up at most large disasters to prevent abuse by criminals and for the safety of the volunteers procedures have been implemented within most response agencies to manage and effectively use these  suvs    the us congress established the   coe  as the principal agency to promote disaster preparedness in the asia-pacific region the national tribal emergency management council  nemc  is a non-profit educational organization developed for tribal organizations to share information and best practices as well as to discuss issues regarding public health and safety emergency management and homeland security affecting those under indian sovereignty ntmc is organized into regions based on the fema 10 region system ntmc was founded by the northwest tribal emergency management council  nwtemc  a consortium of 29 tribal nations and villages in washington idaho oregon and alaska if a disaster or emergency is declared to be terror related or an  incident of national significance  the secretary of homeland security will initiate the   nrf  the nrf allows the integration of federal resources with local country state or tribal entities with management of those resources to be handled at the lowest possible level utilizing the   nims  the  offer  for specific types of emergencies such as disease outbreaks natural disasters and severe weather chemical and radiation accidents etc the  of the  develops resources to address responder safety and health during responder and recovery operations fema s emergency management institute

in emergency or  the smaug model of identifying and prioritizing risk of hazards associated with natural and technological threats is an effective tool smaug stands for seriousness manageability acceptability urgency and growth and are the criteria used for prioritization of hazard risks the smaug model provides an effective means of prioritizing hazard risks based upon the aforementioned criteria in order to address the risks posed by the hazards to the avail of effecting effective  reduction response and  methods seriousness can be defined as  the relative impact in terms of people and dollars  this includes the potential for lives to be lost and potential for injury as well as the physical social and as mentioned economic losses that may be incurred
manageability can be defined as  the relative ability to mitigate or reduce the hazard  through managing the hazard or the community or both  hazards presenting a high risk and as such requiring significant amounts of risk reduction initiatives will be rated high acceptability  the degree to which the risk of hazard is acceptable in terms of political environmental social and economic impact
urgency  this is related to the probability of risk of hazard and is defined in terms of how imperative it is to address the hazard 
growth  this is the potential for the hazard or event to expand or increase in either probability or risk to community or both should vulnerability increase potential for growth may also increase an example of the numerical ratings for each of the four criteria is shown below
