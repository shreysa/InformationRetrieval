category5 hurricanes are  that reach category5 intensity on the  they are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet earth they are rare in the eastern  and generally form only once every several years in general category5s form in clusters in single years landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of  in the  the term  hurricane  is used for tropical cyclones in the pacific ocean north of the  and east of the  a category5 pacific hurricane is therefore a tropical cyclone in the north pacific ocean that reached category5 intensity east of the  identical phenomena in the north pacific ocean west of the dateline are called  typhoons  or  super typhoons  category5 super typhoons generally happen several times per season so cyclones of that intensity are not exceptional for that region this difference in terminology therefore excludes storms such as  and  of  and  of  which formed east of the dateline but did not reach category5 intensity until after crossing the dateline

statistics 

a category5 hurricane is defined as having sustained windspeeds of at least 137   158mph  254km h  over a one-minute period 10 metres  33ft  above the ground as a tropical cyclone is moving its wind field is asymmetric in the northern hemisphere the strongest winds are on the right side of the storm  relative to the direction of motion  the highest winds given in advisories are those from the right side since the  season only 15 hurricanes are known to have reached category5 intensity there are no known category5 storms occurring before 1959 it is possible that some earlier storms reached category5 over open waters but they were never recognized because they never affected land and remained at sea category 5 pacific hurricanes

this lists all of the category5 hurricanes in the order in which they formed only 1994 s hurricane emilia and 2006 s hurricane ioke have reached category5 intensity more than once  that is by weakening into a category4 or weaker storm and later re-strengthening to a category5 storm before the advent of reliable geostationary  coverage in 1966 the number of eastern pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated it is therefore very possible that there are additional category5 hurricanes other than those listed but they were not reported and therefore not recognized however the lack of pacific category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s 1980s and early 1990s is certain the minimum  of these storms is for the most part estimated from satellite imagery using the  in the case of kenna ava and patricia the central pressure was measured by  aircraft flying into the storm because of the estimation of central pressures it is possible that other storms more intense than these have formed the reason for estimating the pressure  in lieu of direct measurements  is the fact that most of these storms did not threaten land as kenna and patricia were threatening land their pressures were measured by  using  while hurricane ava never threatened land it too was flown into by hurricane hunters to test equipment and conduct research older storms have incomplete pressure readings since there were no satellite-based estimates  the only observations were taken by ships land-based observations or reconnaissance aircraft when available ava s minimum known pressure was measured when it was a category4 hurricane for example john and gilma have incomplete pressures because the  in general did not publish pressure on systems in the central pacific  140w to the dateline  at the time however it should be noted that this list is not identical to the list of most intense pacific hurricanes the most intense known category4 storm in the eastern pacific was  the lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars lower than that of some category 5 s such as guillermo hurricanes have reached category5 intensity during every month from june to october the earliest category5 to form in a season is  which formed on june7 the latest category5 to form in a season is  which reached peak intensity on october 24 hurricanes ava    and  are the most intense storms to form in their respective months there have been no may november or off-season category5 hurricanes two pacific hurricanes are known to have reached category5 intensity multiple times   and  both did it twice and ioke reached category5 status a third time as a typhoon while in the western pacific hurricane ioke was tied for the longest-lasting category5 hurricane recorded spending 42hours at that strength while hurricanes john and linda had the longest time spent consecutively at that intensity

climatology 




hurricane guillermo the first of two category5s during the 1997 season 

in the eastern pacific category5 hurricanes usually occur only in  years during el nio years conditions are more favorable for tropical cyclones because of warmer  and reduced  this is why category5s cluster in single seasons the effects of el nio are most significant in the central pacific  140w to the dateline  the general lack of category5s in non warm-enso years is because of there being limited space for development the prevailing  of the area carry warm water to the west as there is no large piece of land to block the water and cause it to  pile up  like in the atlantic the area suitable for all tropical cyclones is small farther out to sea while waters are still warm wind shear limits the development of tropical cyclones in the waters south of hawaii this makes an otherwise ideal region unfavorable for tropical cyclones this does not mean that a category5 hurricane cannot form outside of an el nio event the entire year of 1959 was neither an el nio or a la nia but it had one category5 hurricane  patsy  most of 1973 was during a la nia which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern pacific yet hurricane ava a category 5 hurricane formed in june of that year the 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 seasons are the only pairs of seasons in which a category 5 hurricane formed in consecutive years  rick and celia and marie and patricia respectively  
landfalls 




 one of only three category5 pacific hurricanes to make landfall at any intensity 

of all of the category5 pacific hurricanes the only ones to make landfall at any intensity were   and  none made landfall as category5 hurricanes  patricia and kenna had weakened to category4 at the time of their landfalls and rick was a tropical storm at its landfall patricia was the strongest landfall among pacific hurricanes   and  are tied as the second strongest storms at landfall both of which didn t reach category5 strength but made landfall as stronger category 4 storms than kenna originally a  was thought to have struck manzanillo at category5 intensity but a reanalysis in 2016 indicated the storm had peaked as a category4 hurricane and made landfall with the same winds as kenna patricia was also originally thought to have made landfall as a category5 hurricane near manzanillo before post-season analysis in 2016 in addition to these three systems hurricanes   and  all threatened land for a while john and ioke had minimal impact on  and john caused heavy surf in  linda was briefly forecast to   and it passed close to  near peak intensity the reason for the lack of landfalls is that tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west in the atlantic this sends hurricanes towards north america in the eastern pacific this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear hawaii the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern pacific is protected from most hurricanes by a  and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds
