hawaii s apparent immunity to most hurricanes 




hurricanes in the central pacific  140 w to 180  w  generally travel from east to west however some including hurricanes iwa  1982  and iniki  1992  track in a northerly direction


the islands of hawaii with  as the notable exception appear to be remarkably immune from direct hurricane hits the usgs states that  more commonly near-misses that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands  this has also drawn media attention one notion is that hawaiis volcanic peaks slow down or divert storms a partial source of this idea may be the long list of hurricanes in the above paragraphs that dissipated into tropical storms or depressions upon approaching the islands satellite images of hurricane flossie s breakup when approaching hawaii island fueled this idea another example may be hurricane felicia which dropped from category 4 down to a tropical depression with residual winds predicted at only 35 miles per hour  56km h
