background 
main article  
by 1947 tropical cyclones developing in the north atlantic ocean were named by the  in private communications between weather centres and aircraft using the  this practice continued until september 1950 when the names started to be used publicly after three hurricanes      had occurred simultaneously and caused confusion within the media and the public over the next 2 years the public use of the phonetic alphabet to name systems continued before at the 1953 interdepartmental hurricane conference it was decided to start using a new list of female names during that season as a second phonetic alphabet had been developed during the active but mild  the names were readily used in the press with few objections recorded  as a result the same names were reused during the next year with only one change  gilda for gail over the next 6 years a new list of names was developed ahead of each season before in 1960 forecasters developed four alphabetical sets and repeated them every four years these new sets followed the example of the typhoon names and excluded names beginning with the letters q u x y and z and keeping them to female names only in 1955 it was decided to start retiring the names of significant tropical cyclones for 10 years after which they might be reintroduced with the names carol and edna reintroduced ahead of the 1965 and 1968 hurricane seasons respectively at the 1969 interdepartmental hurricane conference the naming lists were revised after it was decided that the names carol edna and hazel would be permanently retired because of their importance to the research community it was also decided that any significant hurricane in the future would also be permanently retired ahead of the 1971 atlantic hurricane season 10 lists of hurricane names were inaugurated by the  in 1977 it was decided that the  s hurricane committee  wmo  would control the names used who subsequently decided that six lists of names would be used in the atlantic ocean from 1979 onwards with male names included since 1979 the same six lists have been used by the united states   nhc  to name systems with names of significant tropical cyclones retired from the lists permanently and replaced with new names as required at the following year s hurricane committee meeting at present the name of any tropical cyclone may be retired or withdrawn from the list of names at the request of a member state if it acquires notoriety for various reasons including the number of deaths amount of damages or other impacts the committee subsequently discuss the proposal and either through building consensus or a majority vote decides if the name should be retired or withdrawn in march2017 members of the british caribbean territories proposed that a third retirement criterion be added  the tropical cyclone must have sustained winds of at least 96mph  154km h  this came in light of the retirement of  in 2015 which caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides in dominica without producing sustained tropical storm-force winds on the island no action has been taken on this proposal yet names retired in the 1950s 
between 1954 and 1959 eight names were deemed significant enough to be retired for 10 years due to their impact before being permanently retired after 1969 there were no names retired after the 1956 1958 and 1959 seasons collectively these storms resulted in at least 2090 fatalities and over 7009205500000000000 2.06billion in damage the deadliest hurricane was hurricane hazel which killed at least 701 people while the costliest was hurricane diane which caused 7008856000000000000us 856million in damage
