within the united states and as delineated in the  disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility when local government exhausts its resources it then requests specific additional resources from the county level the request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communication systems at various levels some  response to katrina began before the storm with   fema  preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a  team with refrigerated trucks a network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from new orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall  even though many were directed to not enter the area  and continued for more than six months after the storm

the criticisms of the government s response to hurricane katrina primarily consisted of criticism of  and lack of  in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath more specifically the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of new orleans and the subsequent state of chaos in the city the  katrina was coined to refer to this controversy and was a runner-up for  2005 word of the year 
within days of katrina s august 29 landfall public debate arose about the local state and federal governments  role in the  for and response to the hurricane criticism was initially prompted by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders and of residents who remained stranded by flood waters without   or shelter deaths from   and  days after the storm had passed fueled the criticism as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the louisiana superdome and the new orleans civic center some alleged that   and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response for example during  a benefit concert for victims of the hurricane rapper  veered off script and harshly criticized the government s response to the crisis stating that  george bush doesn t care about  
in accordance with federal law president george w bush directed the  michael chertoff to coordinate the federal response chertoff designated  head of the federal emergency management agency as the principal federal official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the gulf coast region however the president and secretary chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination brown claimed that governor blanco resisted their efforts and was unhelpful governor blanco and her staff disputed this eight days later brown was recalled to washington and coast guard vice admiral  replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations three days after the recall michael d brown resigned as director of fema in spite of having received recent praise from president bush politicians activists pundits and journalists also directed criticism at the local and state governments headed by mayor nagin of new orleans and louisiana governor blanco nagin and blanco were criticized for failing to implement new orleans  evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food water security or sanitary conditions perhaps the most important criticism of nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall which led to hundreds of deaths of people who could not find any way out of the city the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina raised other more general public policy issues about    and  the discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected  and  enacted at various  the storm s devastation also prompted a congressional investigation which found that fema and the red cross  did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of gulf coast victims  additionally it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government an abc news  conducted on september 2 2005 showed more blame was being directed at state and local governments  75  than at the federal government  67  with 44 blaming bush s leadership directly a later   showed that respondents disagreed widely on who was to blame for the problems in the city following the hurricane  13 said bush 18 said federal agencies 25 blamed state or local officials and 38 said no one was to blame a 2013 pool of louisiana republicans found more  29  blamed barack obama for the poor federal response to the hurricane than george w bush  28  despite the fact that bush was actually president during the storm and obama merely a junior senator international response

on april 5 2006 months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength lieutenant general   and commander of the corps of engineers testified before the united states senate subcommittee on energy and water that  we have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure 
a june 2007 report released by the  determined that the failures of the levees and floodwalls in new orleans were found to be primarily the result of system design and construction flaws the  is federally mandated in the  with responsibility for the conception design and construction of the region s flood-control system according to report published in august 2015 in the official journal of the  the corps misinterpreted the results of a 1985 study and wrongly concluded that sheet piles in the flood walls needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet  5m  instead of between 31 and 46 feet  9 and 14m  that decision saved approximately us 100 million but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability other factors may have contributed to the flooding according to the authors of catastrophe in the making  island press 2009  the straight design and lack of outward flow into the gulf allowed the  to become  the perfect shortcut for salt-water intrusion  which damaged buffering cypress forests and wetlands which historically had protected new orleans from storm surge the army corps of engineers built and maintained the canal furthermore according to storm surge researcher hassan mashriqui 

 storm surge pushing across shallow lake borgne from the east is constrained by these mrgo levees to the south and to the north by the long-standing levees of the intracoastal waterway  giww  initially ten or more miles apart these two channels meet and when they do the water building between their levees is squeezed into a single channel  the funnel  only 260 yards wide constrained by levees 14 feet to 16 feet high.in concert with the denuded marshes it could increase the local storm surge hitting the intracoastal waterway by 20 percent to 40 percent  a critical and fundamental flaw 

the corps of engineers disputes these causalities nonetheless in june 2008 the army corps of engineers new orleans district submitted a deep-draft de-authorization study of the mrgo which stated that  an economic evaluation of channel navigation use does not demonstrate a federal interest in continued operation and maintenance of the channel  congress ordered the mrgo closed as a direct result many of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of katrina in reconstructing them precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety for example in every situation possible the corps of engineers replaced i-walls with t-walls t-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls however there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements in february 2008 the bush administration requested that the state of louisiana pay about  1.5 billion of an estimated  7.2 billion for corps of engineers levee work  in accordance with the principles of local cost sharing required by congress as early as the   a proposal which angered many louisiana leaders on may 2 2008 louisiana gov  used a speech to the national press club to request that president bush free up money to complete work on louisiana s levees bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill which would pass sooner media involvement

many representatives of the  reporting on the aftermath of hurricane katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events instead of simply reporting because of the loss of most means of communication such as land-based and cellular telephone systems field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities the authorities who monitored local and network news broadcasts as well as internet sites would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports one illustration was when  of  tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the  the role of am radio was also of importance to the hundreds of thousands of persons with no other ties to news providing emergency information regarding access to assistance for hurricane victims immediately after katrina  was one of the few area radio stations in the area remaining on the air this emergency service simulcasted on shortwave outlet  was named    their ongoing nighttime broadcasts continued to be available up to 500mi  800km  away announcers continued to broadcast from improvised studio facilities after the storm damaged their main studios the  antenna network was severely damaged and completely inoperable for several months the storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of especially  and  one example was the effort of nola.com the web affiliate of new orleans   a group of reporters were awarded the breaking news  and shared the public service pulitzer with the biloxi-based  the newspaper s coverage was carried for days only on nola s blogs as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on august 30 the site became an international focal point for news by local media and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums nola was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teamsfrom individuals to the coast guardwhich used information in rescue efforts much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the sms functions of their cell phones to friends and relatives outside the area who then relayed the information back to nola.com the aggregation of community journalism user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention and was called a watershed moment in journalism in the wake of these online-only efforts the pulitzer committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries as the u.s military and rescue services regained control over the city there were restrictions on the activity of the media on september 9 the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have  zero access  to efforts to recover bodies in new orleans immediately following this announcement cnn filed a  and obtained a temporary  against the ban the next day the government backed down and reversed the ban retirement
