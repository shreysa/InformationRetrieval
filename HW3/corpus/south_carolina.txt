in   1869  the supreme court ruled that the ordinances of secession  including that of south carolina  were invalid and thus those states had never left the union however south carolina did not regain representation in congress until that date until the  south carolina s legislature not the voters chose the state s electors for the presidential election south carolina was the last state to choose its electors in this manner on october 19 1871 president  suspended  in nine south carolina counties under the authority of the  led by grant s attorney general  hundreds of klansmen were arrested while 2000 klansmen fled the state this was done in order to suppress klan violence against african-american and white voters in the south in the mid to late 1870s white democrats used  groups such as the  to intimidate and terrorize black voters they regained political control of the state under conservative white   and pro-business  in 1877 the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the  that ended reconstruction populist and agrarian movements 
the state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the populist and agrarian movements of the 1890s a republican-populist biracial coalition took power away from white democrats temporarily to prevent that from happening again democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 that effectively  almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for  residency and  that dramatically reduced the voter rolls by 1896 only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls although they constituted a majority of the state s population the 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement  the 782,509 african american citizens comprised more than 58 of the state s population but they were essentially without any political representation in the  society the 1895 constitution overturned local representative government reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government effectively ruled by the general assembly through the legislative delegations for each county as each county had one state senator that person had considerable power the counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in 1975 governor  a populist led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites although he controlled democratic state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers during the constitutional convention in 1895 he supported another man s proposal that the state adopt a  as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known african ancestry some members of the convention realized that prominent white families with some african ancestry could be affected by such legislation in terms similar to a debate in virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal  which was dropped  george dionysius tillman said the following in opposition 

if the law is made as it now stands respectable families in    and  will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified at least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge they have sent good soldiers to the confederate army and are now landowners and taxpayers those men served creditably and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way it is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded caucasian on the floor of this convention every member has in him a certain mixture of colored blood the pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose it would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation of scandal horror feud and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote perhaps obsolete trace of negro blood the doors would be open to scandal malice and greed  to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that a or b had negro blood in their veins any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father 
the state postponed such a one-drop law for years virginian legislators adopted a one-drop law in 1924 forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as white 20th century
