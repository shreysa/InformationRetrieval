history 
among the ancient greeks several of the  school believed in the rotation of the earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens perhaps the first was   470385 bce  though his system was complicated including a  rotating daily about a central fire a more conventional picture was that supported by   and  in the fourth century bce who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun in the third century bce  suggested the  however  in the fourth century bce criticized the ideas of philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation he established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth this was accepted by most of those who came after in particular   2nd century ce  who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated in 499 ce the   wrote that the spherical earth rotates about its axis daily and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth he provided the following analogy   just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction in the same way to a man at  the xed stars appear to be going westward 
in the 10th century some  accepted that the earth rotates around its axis according to    d circa 1020  invented an  called al-zraq based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries  that the motion we see is due to the earth s movement and not to that of the sky  the prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states   according to the geometers   muhandisn  the earth is in constant circular motion and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars  treatises were written to discuss its possibility either as refutations or expressing doubts about ptolemy s arguments against it at the  and  the earth s rotation was discussed by   b 1201  and   b 1403  the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by copernicus in medieval europe  accepted aristotle s view and so reluctantly did  and  in the fourteenth century not until  in 1543 adopted a  world system did the contemporary understanding of earth s rotation begin to be established copernicus pointed out that if the movement of the earth is violent then the movement of the stars must be very much more so he acknowledged the contribution of the pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion for copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central sun  who produced accurate observations on which  based his  used copernicus s work as the basis of a  assuming a stationary earth in 1600  strongly supported the earth s rotation in his treatise on the earth s magnetism and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries those like gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of the earth about the sun are often called  semi-copernicans  a century after copernicus  disputed the model of a rotating earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies  such deflections would later be called the  however the contributions of kepler  and  gathered support for the theory of the rotation of the earth empirical tests 
the earth s rotation implies that the equator bulges and the poles are flattened in his  newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1 230 and pointed to the 1673  measurements by  as corroboration of the change in gravity but  of  by  and  at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite however measurements by  and the  in the 1730s established the  thus confirming both newton and the copernican position in the earth s rotating frame of reference a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference because of the  falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release and projectiles veer right in the northern hemisphere  and left in the southern  from the direction in which they are shot the coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale where it is responsible for the differing rotation direction of  in the northern and southern hemispheres hooke following a 1679 suggestion from newton tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of 8.2 meters but definitive results were only obtained later in the late 18th and early 19th century by  in   in  and  in  using taller towers and carefully released weights a ball dropped from a height of 158.5m  520ft  departed by 27.4mm  1.08in  from the vertical compared with a calculated value of 28.1mm  1.11in  the most celebrated test of earth s rotation is the  first built by physicist  in 1851 which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspended 67 m from the top of the  in paris because of the earth s rotation under the swinging pendulum the pendulum s plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude at the latitude of paris the predicted and observed shift was about 11 degrees  per hour foucault pendulums now swing in  rotation period

true solar day 
main article  
earth s  relative to the sun   to solar noon  is its true solar day or apparent solar day it depends on the earth s orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the  and  of earth s orbit both vary over thousands of years so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies generally it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two the true solar day tends to be longer near  when the sun apparently moves along the  through a greater angle than usual taking about 10 seconds longer to do so conversely it is about 10 seconds shorter near  it is about 20 seconds longer near a  when the projection of the sun s apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the  causes the sun to move through a greater angle than usual conversely near an  the projection onto the equator is shorter by about 20 seconds currently the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near 22 december by 30 mean solar seconds but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near 19 june when it is only 13 seconds longer the effects of the equinoxes shorten it near 26 march and 16 september by 18 seconds and 21 seconds respectively mean solar day 
main article  
the average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day which contains 86,400 mean solar seconds currently each of these seconds is slightly longer than an  second because earth s mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to  the average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86,400 si seconds random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms the mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by  as the independent unit of time in his  these tables were used to calculate the world s  between 1900 and 1983 so this second became known as the  in 1967 the si second was made equal to the ephemeris second the  is a measure of the earth s rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the  stellar and sidereal day 




on a  planet like the earth the stellar day is shorter than the  at time 1 the sun and a certain distant star are both overhead at time 2 the planet has rotated 360 and the distant star is overhead again but the sun is not  12   one stellar day  it is not until a little later at time 3 that the sun is overhead again  13   one solar day  

earth s rotation period relative to the  called its stellar day by the   iers  is 86,164.098 903 691 seconds of mean solar time  ut1   23h 56m 4.098 903 691s 0.997 269 663 237 16 mean solar days  earth s rotation period relative to the  or moving mean vernal equinox named  is 86,164.090 530 832 88 seconds of mean solar time  ut1   23h 56m 4.090 530 832 88s 0.997 269 566 329 08 mean solar days  thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms both the stellar day and the sidereal day are shorter than the mean solar day by about 3 minutes 56 seconds the mean solar day in si seconds is available from the iers for the periods 16232005 and 19622005 recently  19992010  the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of 86,400 si seconds has varied between 0.25 ms and 1 ms which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in si seconds  see   angular speed

the angular speed of earth s rotation in inertial space is  7.2921150  0.0000001  105  per si second  mean solar second  multiplying by  180  radians 86,400 seconds mean solar day  yields 360.9856 mean solar day indicating that earth rotates more than 360 relative to the fixed stars in one solar day earth s movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean sun can pass overhead again even though it rotates only once  360  relative to the mean sun multiplying the value in rad s by earth s equatorial radius of 6,378,137 m   ellipsoid   factors of 2 radians needed by both cancel  yields an equatorial speed of 465.1m s  1,526ft s  or 1,674.4km h  1,040.4mph  some sources state that earth s equatorial speed is slightly less or 1,669.8 km h this is obtained by dividing earth s equatorial circumference by 24 hours however the use of only one circumference unwittingly implies only one rotation in inertial space so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour this is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day 1.002 737 909 350 795 which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of 1,674.4 km h the tangential speed of earth s rotation at a point on earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude for example the  is located at latitude 28.59 n which yields a speed of  cos 28.59  1,674.4km h  1,040.4mph  465.1m s    1,470.23km h  913.56mph  408.40m s 
changes in rotation 
main articles   and 




earth s  is about 23.4 it oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 on a 41,000-year cycle and is currently decreasing 

change in rotational axis 
the earth s rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars   the components of this motion are  and  it also moves with respect to the earth s crust  this is called  precession is a rotation of the earth s rotation axis caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the  moon and other bodies the polar motion is primarily due to  and the  change in rotational velocity
over millions of years the earth s rotation slowed significantly by  through gravitational interactions with the moon in this process  is slowly transferred to the moon at a rate proportional to  where  is the orbital radius of the moon this process gradually increased the length of day to its current value and resulted in the moon being  with the earth this gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented with estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of  and   a compilation of these measurements found the length of day to increase steadily from about 21 hours at 600myr ago to the current 24 hour value by counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides tidal frequencies  and thus day lengths  can be estimated much like counting tree rings though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages resonant stabilization 
the current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high implying the earth s rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past empirical data tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600myr ago some models suggest that the earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the precambrian this day length corresponds to the semidiurnal  of the thermally-driven   at this day length the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period this stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the  or  broke this stable configuration about 600myr ago citing the resemblance of simulated results and existing paleorotational data 



deviation of day length from si based day


global events 
additionally some large scale events such as the  have caused the rotation to speed up by around 3 microseconds by affecting the earth s moment of inertia  ongoing since the last  is also changing the distribution of the earth s mass thus affecting the  of the earth and by the  the earth s rotation period measurement 
the permanent monitoring of the earth s rotation is performed with  coordinated with the   and other  techniques this provides an absolute  for the determination of  precession and nutation ancient observations 

there are preserved observations of  and  from  and  beginning from the 8th century bce these observations as well as further astronomical historical records from  and elsewhere can be used to determine the actual changes in the rotation of the earth over the last 27 centuries  the calculation to describe the place and time of eclipse is dependent on the rotation of the earth the ancient observations are consistent with the earth having rotated a significant fraction of a total turn than would result from today s value of the speed of rotation would indicate  the earth was turning ever faster throughout the past the cumulative effect of the faster turn of a magnitude of milliseconds per day per century 36,525 days per century shows up in a magnitude of hours and thousands of kilometers in observations scholars have combed the ancient records and calculated by modern models the magnitude of the long term historical slowing down of the earth s rotation origin

notes 


 see   german wikipedia article   when earth s eccentricity exceeds 0.047 and perihelion is at an appropriate equinox or solstice only one period with one peak balances another period that has two peaks  aoki the ultimate source of these figures uses the term  seconds of ut1  instead of  seconds of mean solar time   in astronomy unlike geometry 360 means returning to the same point in some cyclical time scale either one mean solar day or one sidereal day for rotation on earth s axis or one sidereal year or one mean tropical year or even one mean  containing exactly 365.25 days for revolution around the sun
