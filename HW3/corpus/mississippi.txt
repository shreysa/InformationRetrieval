on january 9 1861 mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the  and it was one of the founding members of the  the first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves during the war union and confederate forces struggled for dominance on the mississippi river critical to supply routes and commerce more than 80,000 mississippians fought in the  and casualties were extremely heavy union general  s long siege of  finally gained the union control of the river in 1863 in the postwar period  withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations the majority of blacks left the southern baptist church sharply reducing its membership they created independent black baptist congregations by 1895 they had established numerous black baptist state associations and the  of black churches in addition independent black denominations such as the   established in   and the   established in new york city  sent  to the south in the postwar years they quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the south southern congregations brought their own influences to those denominations as well during  the first mississippi constitutional convention in 1868 with delegates both black and white framed a constitution whose major elements would be maintained for 22 years the convention was the first political organization in the state to include african-american representatives 17 among the 100 members  32 counties had black majorities at the time  some among the black delegates were  but others were educated free blacks who had migrated from the north the convention adopted universal suffrage  did away with property qualifications for  or for office a change that also benefited both blacks and poor whites  provided for the state s first public school system  forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property  and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel under the terms of reconstruction mississippi was restored to the union on february 23 1870 because the mississippi delta contained so much fertile bottomland that had not been developed before the civil war 90 percent of the land was still frontier after the civil war tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land in addition black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and raising timber and eventually advance to ownership the new farmers included many freedmen who achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the mississippi bottomlands by the late 19th century in the 1870s and 1880s many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership around the start of the 20th century two-thirds of the mississippi farmers who owned land in the delta were  many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the civil war as another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s however numerous african-american farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts thus losing the land which they had developed by personal labor democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1875 after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the  white line  campaign based on asserting  democratic whites became well armed and formed  organizations such as the  to suppress black voting from 1874 to the elections of 1875 they pressured whites to join the democrats and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known  riots  in cities around the state to intimidate blacks and suppress their voting they killed a total of 150 blacks although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many a total of three white republicans and five white democrats were reported killed in rural areas deaths of blacks could be covered up riots  better described as massacres of blacks  took place in vicksburg clinton macon and in their counties as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and  known black leaders destroying local political organizations seeing the success of this deliberate   south carolina and other states followed it and also achieved white dominance in 1877 the last of federal troops were withdrawn from the region even in this environment black mississippians continued to be elected into local office however black residents were deprived of all political power after white legislators passed a new state constitution in 1890 specifically to  eliminate the nigger from politics  according to the state s  governor  it erected barriers to voter registration and electoral provisions that effectively  most black mississippians and many poor whites estimates are that 100,000 black and 50,000 white men were removed from voter registration rolls in the state over the next few years the loss of political influence contributed to the difficulties of african americans in their attempts to obtain extended credit in the late 19th century together with imposition of  and racial segregation laws whites committed an increased rate of lynchings of blacks mostly men beginning in the 1890s and extending to 1930 cotton crops failed due to  infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913 creating crisis conditions for many african americans with control of the ballot box and more access to credit white planters bought out such farmers expanding their ownership of delta bottomlands they also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state

in the early 20th century some industries were established in mississippi but jobs were generally restricted to whites including child workers the lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as chicago and detroit seeking employment where they also competed with european immigrants the state depended on agriculture but mechanization put many farm laborers out of work by 1900 many white ministers especially in the towns subscribed to the  movement which attempted to apply christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day many strongly supported  believing it would help alleviate and prevent many sins african-american baptist churches grew to include more than twice the number of members as their white baptist counterparts the african-american call for social equality resonated throughout the  in the 1930s and  in the 1940s the  from the south started in the 1940s lasting until 1970 almost half a million people left mississippi in the second migration three-quarters of them black nationwide during the first half of the 20th century african americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs the second great migration included destinations in the  especially  where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher paying jobs to both african americans and whites blacks and whites in mississippi generated rich quintessentially american music traditions      and  all were invented promulgated or heavily developed by mississippi musicians many of them african american and most came from the  many musicians carried their music north to chicago where they made it the heart of that city s jazz and blues so many african americans left in the great migration that after the 1930s they became a minority in
