the song has been described as very ominous and doom-laden the song opens with gentle melodic and melancholic clean guitar notes followed by vocals by kensrue the verses show a calm soothing conversation of two lovers speaking about how to avoid an upcoming hurricane while the chorus erupts with large  and intense vocals representing the coming of the storm  dustin kensrue outlined the ideas and concepts explored in the song 

thrice being a heavier kind of band and me being a bit drawn to the bigger issues of life in general all that gravitates a lot of times towards writing pretty weighty heavy lyrics  was no exception  i m listening to it with everything going on and there s just this weight and heaviness to it  hurricane  is a good example of my trying to find something that fits there  the beauty and calm of the  slamming into this  and i m trying to find something that works with that and i end up writing something where i end up questioning why all these beautiful moments in time are always shattered by something  because that s what the music feels likes its doing 

despite  typically being the band s  kensrue both wrote and played the song s lead guitar part in the song something attributed to the fact that he wrote the part and because he felt it sounds better coming from his particular  and  setup specifically the  pog 2 personnel
