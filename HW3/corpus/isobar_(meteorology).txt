types 
contour lines are often given specific names beginning  iso    isos equal  according to the nature of the variable being mapped although in many usages the phrase  contour line  is most commonly used specific names are most common in meteorology where multiple maps with different variables may be viewed simultaneously the prefix  iso  can be replaced with  isallo  to specify a contour line connecting points where a variable changes at the same rate during a given time period the words isoline and isarithm   arithmos  number  are general terms covering all types of contour line the word isogram   gramma  writing or drawing  was proposed by  in 1889 as a convenient generic designation for lines indicating equality of some physical condition or quantity  but it commonly refers to a  an isogon  from  or gonia meaning  angle  is a contour line for a variable which measures direction in meteorology and in geomagnetics the term isogon has specific meanings which are described below an   from  or klinein meaning  to lean or slope  is a line joining points with equal slope in population dynamics and in geomagnetics the terms isocline and isoclinic line have specific meanings which are described below equidistant points 
a curve of equidistant points is a set of points all at the same distance from a given   or  in this case the function whose value is being held constant along a contour line is a  isopleths 
in geography the word isopleth  from  or plethos meaning  quantity  is used for contour lines that depict a variable which cannot be measured at a point but which instead must be calculated from data collected over an area an example is  which can be calculated by dividing the population of a  by the surface area of that district each calculated value is presumed to be the value of the variable at the centre of the area and isopleths can then be drawn by a process of  the idea of an isopleth map can be compared with that of a  in meteorology the word isopleth is used for any type of contour line meteorology 




isohyetal map of precipitation


meteorological contour lines are based on  of the point data received from  and  weather stations are seldom exactly positioned at a contour line  when they are this indicates a measurement precisely equal to the value of the contour  instead lines are drawn to best approximate the locations of exact values based on the scattered information points available  may present collected data such as actual air pressure at a given time or generalized data such as average pressure over a period of time or forecast data such as predicted air pressure at some point in the future

an isotherm  from  or therm meaning  heat  is a line that connects points on a map that have the same  therefore all points through which an isotherm passes have the same or equal temperatures at the time indicated an isotherm at 0c is called the  the term was coined by the prussian geographer and naturalist alexander von humboldt who as part of his research into the geographical distribution of plants published the first map of isotherms in paris in 1817 an isogeotherm is a line of equal mean annual temperature an isocheim is a line of equal mean winter temperature and an isothere is a line of equal mean summer temperature an isohel  from  or helios meaning  sun  is a line of equal or constant  rainfall and air moisture 
an isohyet or isohyetal line  from  or huetos meaning  rain  is a line joining points of equal rainfall on a  in a given period  a map with isohyets is called an isohyetal map an isohume is a line of constant relative  while a isodrosotherm  from  or drosos meaning  dew  and  or therme meaning  heat  is a line of equal or constant  an isoneph is a line indicating equal  cover an isochalaz is a line of constant frequency of  storms and an isobront is a line drawn through geographical points at which a given phase of thunderstorm activity occurred simultaneously  cover is frequently shown as a contour-line map wind 
an isotach  from  or tachus meaning  fast  is a line joining points with constant  speed in meteorology the term isogon refers to a line of constant wind direction freeze and thaw 
an isopectic line denotes equal dates of  formation each winter and an isotac denotes equal dates of thawing physical geography and oceanography




 of   the brown contour lines represent the  the contour interval is 20  

contours are one of several  used to denote  or  and depth on  from these contours a sense of the general  can be determined they are used at a variety of scales from large-scale engineering drawings and architectural plans through  and  up to continental-scale maps  contour line  is the most common usage in  but  for underwater depths on  maps and isohypse for elevations are also used in cartography the contour interval is the elevation difference between adjacent contour lines the contour interval should be the same over a single map when calculated as a ratio against the map scale a sense of the hilliness of the terrain can be derived interpretation 
there are several rules to note when interpreting terrain contour lines 

the rule of vs  sharp-pointed vees usually are in stream valleys with the drainage channel passing through the point of the vee with the vee pointing upstream this is a consequence of  the rule of os  closed loops are normally uphill on the inside and downhill on the outside and the innermost loop is the highest area if a loop instead represents a depression some maps note this by short lines radiating from the inside of the loop called  hachures  spacing of contours  close contours indicate a steep slope  distant contours a shallow slope two or more contour lines merging indicates a cliff by counting the number of contours that cross a segment of a  the  can be approximated 
of course to determine differences in elevation between two points the contour interval or distance in altitude between two adjacent contour lines must be known and this is normally stated in the map key usually contour intervals are consistent throughout a map but there are exceptions sometimes intermediate contours are present in flatter areas  these can be dashed or dotted lines at half the noted contour interval when contours are used with hypsometric tints on a small-scale map that includes mountains and flatter low-lying areas it is common to have smaller intervals at lower elevations so that detail is shown in all areas conversely for an island which consists of a plateau surrounded by steep cliffs it is possible to use smaller intervals as the height increases electrostatics 
an  is a measure of electrostatic potential in space often depicted in two dimensions with the electostatic charges inducing that  the term  line or isopotential line refers to a curve of constant  whether crossing an equipotential line represents ascending or descending the potential is inferred from the labels on the charges in three dimensions  surfaces may be depicted with a two dimensional cross-section showing  lines at the intersection of the surfaces and the cross-section the general mathematical term  is often used to describe the full collection of points having a particular potential especially in higher dimensional space magnetism

in the study of the  the term isogon or isogonic line refers to a line of constant  the variation of magnetic north from geographic north an agonic line is drawn through points of zero magnetic declination an isoporic line refers to a line of constant annual variation of magnetic declination  an isoclinic line connects points of equal  and an aclinic line is the isoclinic line of magnetic dip zero an isodynamic line  from  or dynamis meaning  power  connects points with the same intensity of magnetic force oceanography 
besides ocean depth  use contour to describe diffuse variable phenomena much as meteorologists do with atmospheric phenomena in particular isobathytherms are lines showing depths of water with equal temperature isohalines show lines of equal ocean salinity and  are surfaces of equal water density geology 
various  data are rendered as contour maps in    and  contour maps are used to show the below ground surface of geologic   surfaces  especially low angle   and   use isopachs  lines of equal thickness  to illustrate variations in thickness of geologic units environmental science 
in discussing pollution density maps can be very useful in indicating sources and areas of greatest contamination contour maps are especially useful for diffuse forms or scales of pollution acid precipitation is indicated on maps with isoplats some of the most widespread applications of environmental science contour maps involve mapping of   where lines of equal sound pressure level are denoted isobels     and  contamination by  and  the rate of  and thus  can be substantially reduced  this is especially important in  zones ecology 
an isoflor is an isopleth contour connecting areas of comparable biological diversity usually the variable is the number of species of a given genus or family that occurs in a region isoflor maps are thus used to show distribution patterns and trends such as centres of diversity social sciences

contour lines are also used to display non-geographic information in economics   as shown at left  are used to show bundles of goods to which a person would assign equal utility an   in the image at right  is a curve of equal production quantity for alternative combinations of  and an   also in the image at right  shows alternative usages having equal production costs in  an analogous method is used in understanding coalitions  for example the diagram in laver and shepsle s work  in  an  shows the set of population sizes at which the rate of change or partial derivative for one population in a pair of interacting populations is zero statistics 
in statistics isodensity lines  or isodensanes are lines that join points with the same value of a  isodensanes are used to display  for example for a bivariate  the isodensity lines are  thermodynamics engineering and other sciences 
various types of graphs in  engineering and other sciences use isobars  constant pressure  isotherms  constant temperature  isochors  constant specific volume  or other types of isolines even though these graphs are usually not related to maps such isolines are useful for representing more than two dimensions  or quantities  on two-dimensional graphs common examples in thermodynamics are some types of   are used to solve  in interpreting  images an isodop is a line of equal  velocity and an isoecho is a line of equal radar reflectivity other phenomena

history 
the idea of lines that join points of equal value was rediscovered several times the oldest known   contour line of constant depth  is found on a map dated 1584 of the river  near  by   in 1701  used such lines  isogons  on a chart of magnetic variation the dutch engineer  drew the bed of the river  with lines of equal depth  isobaths  at intervals of 1  in 1727 and  used them at 10-fathom intervals on a chart of the  that was prepared in 1737 and published in 1752 such lines were used to describe a land surface  contour lines  in a map of the duchy of modena and reggio by domenico vandelli in 1746 and they were studied theoretically by ducarla in 1771 and  used them in the  in 1791 a map of  by j l dupain-triel used contour lines at 20-metre intervals hachures spot-heights and a vertical section in 1801 the chief of the corps of engineers  used contour lines at the larger scale of 1 500 on a plan of his projects for rocca d aufo by around 1843 when the  started to regularly record contour lines in  and  they were already in general use in european countries isobaths were not routinely used on  until those of  from 1834 and those of britain from 1838 when maps with contour lines became common the idea spread to other applications perhaps the latest to develop are  and  contour maps which first appeared in the united states in approximately 1970 largely as a result of national legislation requiring spatial delineation of these parameters in 2007  was the first to allow users to dynamically generate elevation contour lines to be laid over oblique images graphical design 
for features specific to  see  and  to maximize readability of contour maps there are several design choices available to the map creator principally line weight line  line type and method of numerical marking line weight is simply the darkness or thickness of the line used this choice is made based upon the least intrusive form of contours that enable the reader to decipher the background information in the map itself if there is little or no content on the base map the contour lines may be drawn with relatively heavy thickness also for many forms of contours such as topographic maps it is common to vary the line weight and or color so that a different line characteristic occurs for certain numerical values for example in the  map above the even hundred foot elevations are shown in a different weight from the twenty foot intervals line color is the choice of any number of  that suit the display sometimes a  is used as well as color to set the contour lines apart from the  line colour can be varied to show other information line type refers to whether the basic contour line is solid dashed dotted or broken in some other pattern to create the desired effect dotted or dashed lines are often used when the underlying base map conveys very important  or difficult to read  information broken line types are used when the location of the contour line is inferred numerical marking is the manner of denoting the  values of contour lines this can be done by placing numbers along some of the contour lines typically using  for intervening lines alternatively a map key can be produced associating the contours with their values if the contour lines are not numerically labeled and adjacent lines have the same style  with the same weight color and type  then the direction of the gradient cannot be determined from the contour lines alone however if the contour lines cycle through three or more styles then the direction of the gradient can be determined from the lines the orientation of the numerical text labels is often used to indicate the direction of the slope plan view versus profile view

most commonly contour lines are drawn in plan view or as an observer in space would view the earth s surface  ordinary map form however some parameters can often be displayed in profile view showing a vertical profile of the parameter mapped some of the most common parameters mapped in profile are  and  in each of those cases it may be important to analyze  air pollutant concentrations or sound levels  at varying heights so as to determine the air quality or  on people at different elevations for example living on different floor levels of an urban apartment in actuality both plan and profile view contour maps are used in  and  studies labeling contour maps 




contour map labeled aesthetically in an  elevation up  manner 

 are a critical component of elevation maps a properly labeled contour map helps the reader to quickly interpret the shape of the terrain if numbers are placed close to each other it means that the terrain is steep labels should be placed along a slightly curved line  pointing  to the summit or nadir from several directions if possible making the visual identification of the summit or nadir easy contour labels can be oriented so a reader is facing uphill when reading the label manual labeling of contour maps is a time-consuming process however there are a few software systems that can do the job automatically and in accordance with cartographic conventions called  see also
