not to be confused with  
enthalpy   is a measurement of  in a  it is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume more technically it includes the  which is the energy required to create a system and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its  and establishing its volume and pressure enthalpy is defined as a  that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system s internal energy pressure and volume it is an  quantity the unit of measurement for enthalpy in the   si  is the  but other historical conventional units are still in use such as the  and the  enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical biological and physical measurements at constant pressure because it simplifies the description of  at constant pressure the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work the total enthalpy h of a system cannot be measured directly the same situation exists in classical mechanics  only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system we must refer to a defined reference point  therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy h the h is a positive change in  reactions and negative in heat-releasing  processes for processes under constant pressure h is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system plus the  that the system has done on its surroundings this means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed  or released  by the material through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure assume   most commonly 1 bar pressure standard state does not strictly speaking specify a temperature  see   but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25c enthalpy of  and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure unlike  and  real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses

origins 
the word enthalpy stems from the  verb enthalpein   which means  to warm in  it combines the  prefix  en meaning  to put into  and the verb  thalpein meaning  to heat  the word enthalpy is often incorrectly attributed to  and  through the 1850 publication of their  this misconception was popularized by the 1927 publication of  however neither the concept the word nor the symbol for enthalpy existed until well after clapeyron s death the earliest writings to contain the concept of enthalpy did not appear until 1875 when  introduced  a heat function for constant pressure  however gibbs did not use the word  enthalpy  in his writings the actual word first appears in the scientific literature in a 1909 publication by j p dalton according to that publication  actually coined the word over the years scientists used many different symbols to denote enthalpy in 1922 alfred w porter proposed the symbol  h  as a standard thus finalizing the terminology still in use today in the past enthalpy was sometimes called heat content the fact that the change in enthalpy h equals the heat absorbed in processes at constant pressure is the reason for this name however this equality is not true in general  when the pressure varies  so that the term heat content is considered misleading and is now  formal definition 
the enthalpy of a homogeneous system is defined as



where

h is the enthalpy of the system u is the  of the system p is the  of the system v is the  of the system 
enthalpy is an  this means that for homogeneous systems the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system it is convenient to introduce the  h h m where m is the mass of the system or the molar enthalpy hm h n where n is the number of moles  h and hm are   for inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems 



where the label k refers to the various subsystems in case of continuously varying p t or composition the summation becomes an integral 



where  is the density the enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function h s,p  of the entropy s and the pressure p and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows we start from the  for closed systems for an infinitesimal process 



here q is a small amount of heat added to the system and w a small amount of work performed by the system in a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place so the  gives q   tds with t the  of the system furthermore if only pv work is done w   pdv as a result 


adding d pv  to both sides of this expression gives



or



so



other expressions 
the above expression of dh in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers however there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure 88



here cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure and  is the coefficient of  cubic  thermal expansion 



with this expression one can in principle determine the enthalpy if cp and v are known as functions of p and t note that for an  t 1 so that



in a more general form the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the  and the number of particles of various types the differential statement for dh then becomes



where i is the chemical potential per particle for an i-type particle and ni is the number of such particles the last term can also be written as idni  with dni the number of moles of component i added to the system and in this case i the molar chemical potential  or as idmi  with dmi the mass of component i added to the system and in this case i the specific chemical potential  physical interpretation 
the u term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system and the pv term as the energy that would be required to  make room  for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant when a system for example n  of a gas of  v at  p and  t is created or brought to its present state from  energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy u plus pv where pv is the  done in pushing against the ambient  atmospheric  pressure in basic  and  it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used in basic  experiments are often conducted at constant  and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled so that h is the expression chosen for the  for a  a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the  done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine 



where the work w done by the engine is 



relationship to heat 
in order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply we return to the first law for closed systems  du   q  w we apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface in this case the work term can be split into two contributions the so-called pv work given by pdv  where here p is the pressure at the surface dv is the increase of the volume of the system  and all other types of work w such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction so we write w   pdv   w in this case the first law reads 



or



from this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added  



provided that the system is under   dp 0  and that the only work done by the system is expansion work  w 0  applications 
in thermodynamics one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from  nothingness  the mechanical work required pv differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the   must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system assuming that the pressure p remains constant  this is the pv term the supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy u which includes  ionization energies mixing energies vaporization energies chemical bond energies and so forth together these constitute the change in the enthalpy u pv for systems at constant pressure with no external work done other than the pv work the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system for a simple system with a constant number of particles the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant heat of reaction

the total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly the enthalpy change of a  is measured instead enthalpy change is defined by the following equation 



where

h is the  enthalpy change  hf is the final enthalpy of the system  in a chemical reaction the enthalpy of the products  hi is the initial enthalpy of the system  in a chemical reaction the enthalpy of the reactants  
for an  at constant  the system s change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings in a similar manner for an  reaction the system s change in enthalpy is equal to the energy absorbed in the reaction including the energy lost by the system and gained from compression from its surroundings a relatively easy way to determine whether or not a reaction is exothermic or endothermic is to determine the sign of h if h is positive the reaction is endothermic that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants on the other hand if h is negative the reaction is exothermic that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat specific enthalpy 
the specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as h   h m where m is the mass of the system the  for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram it can be expressed in other specific quantities by h   u   pv where u is the specific  p is the pressure and v is specific volume which is equal to 1  where  is the density enthalpy changes 
an enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction it is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed i.e the enthalpy of the  and the initial enthalpy of the system i.e the reactants these processes are reversible  and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change a common standard enthalpy change is the  which has been determined for a large number of substances enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works such as the  the following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics when used in these recognized terms the qualifier change is usually dropped and the property is simply termed enthalpy of  process  since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters or  including 

a  of 25c or 298k a  of one atmosphere  1atm or 101.325kpa  a  of 1.0m when the element or compound is present in solution elements or compounds in their normal physical states i.e  
for such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term standard e.g standard enthalpy of formation chemical properties 

 defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of substance reacts completely  defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a compound is formed from its elementary antecedents  defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a substance burns completely with oxygen  defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts completely with an excess of hydrogen to form a saturated compound  defined as the enthalpy change required to atomize one mole of compound completely  defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of water is formed when an acid and a base react standard  defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a solute is dissolved completely in an excess of solvent so that the solution is at infinite dilution standard enthalpy of  defined as the enthalpy change required to denature one mole of compound  defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of gaseous ions are completely dissolved in water forming one mole of aqueous ions

open systems 
in   matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries the first law of thermodynamics for open systems states  the increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system 



where uin is the average internal energy entering the system and uout is the average internal energy leaving the system 



during  operation an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added


the region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a  and it may or may not correspond to physical walls if we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid there are then two types of work performed  flow work described above which is performed on the fluid  this is also often called pv work  and shaft work which may be performed on some mechanical device these two types of work are expressed in the equation



substitution into the equation above for the control volume  cv  yields 



the definition of enthalpy h permits us to use this  to account for both internal energy and pv work in fluids for open systems 



if we allow also the system boundary to move  e.g due to moving pistons  we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems in terms of time derivatives it reads 



with sums over the various places k where heat is supplied matter flows into the system and boundaries are moving the k terms represent enthalpy flows which can be written as



with k the mass flow and k the molar flow at position k respectively the term dvk dt represents the rate of change of the system volume at position k that results in pv power done by the system the parameter p represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power but it can also be e.g electric power produced by an electrical power plant note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet  otherwise it has to be included in the enthalpy balance during  operation of a device  see   and   the average du dt may be set equal to zero this yields a useful expression for the average  generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions 



where the  denote time averages the technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems as formulated above diagrams

nowadays the enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form there are many types of diagrams such as ht diagrams which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures and hp diagrams which give h as function of p for various t one of the most common diagrams is the temperaturespecific entropy diagram  ts-diagram  it gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps these diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer some basic applications

throttling 
main article  




schematic diagram of a throttling in the steady state fluid enters the system  dotted rectangle  at point 1 and leaves it at point 2 the mass flow is  

one of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process also known as  it concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance  valve porous plug or any other type of flow resistance  as shown in the figure this process is very important since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator it is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers for a steady state flow regime the enthalpy of the system  dotted rectangle  has to be constant hence



since the mass flow is constant the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same 



that is the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling the consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ts diagram above point c is at 200bar and room temperature  300k  a joulethomson expansion from 200bar to 1bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425kj kg  not shown in the diagram  lying between the 400 and 450kj kg isenthalps and ends in point d which is at a temperature of about 270k hence the expansion from 200bar to 1bar cools nitrogen from 300k to 270k in the valve there is a lot of friction and a lot of entropy is produced but still the final temperature is below the starting value 
point e is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with h   100 kj kg it corresponds roughly with p   13 bar and t   108 k throttling from this point to a pressure of 1bar ends in the two-phase region  point f  this means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter the enthalpy in f  hf  is equal to the enthalpy in g  hg  multiplied by the liquid fraction in f  xf  plus the enthalpy in h  hh  multiplied by the gas fraction in f  1  xf  so



with numbers  100   xf  28    1  xf   230 so xf 0.64 this means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquidgas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64 compressors

schematic diagram of a compressor in the steady state fluid enters the system  dotted rectangle  at point 1 and leaves it at point 2 the mass flow is  a power p is applied and a heat flow q is released to the surroundings at ambient temperature ta 

a power p is applied e.g as electrical power if the compression is adiabatic the gas temperature goes up in the reversible case it would be at constant entropy which corresponds with a vertical line in the ts diagram for example compressing nitrogen from 1 bar  point a  to 2 bar  point b  would result in a temperature increase from 300 k to 380 k in order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature ta heat exchange e.g by cooling water is necessary in the ideal case the compression is isothermal the average heat flow to the surroundings is q since the system is in the steady state the first law gives



the minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible in that case the  for open systems gives



eliminating q gives for the minimal power



for example compressing 1kg of nitrogen from 1bar to 200bar costs at least  hc  ha   ta sc  sa  with the data obtained with the ts diagram we find a value of  430  461   300   5.16  6.85    476kj kg the relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as



with dh   tds   vdp this results in the final relation
