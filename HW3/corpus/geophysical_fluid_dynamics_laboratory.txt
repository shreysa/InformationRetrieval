the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory  gfdl  is a laboratory in the   noaa    oar  the current director is dr  it is one of seven noaa research laboratories  rls  gfdl is engaged in comprehensive long lead-time research to expand the scientific understanding of the physical processes that govern the behavior of the  and the  as  these systems can then be modeled mathematically and their  can be studied by computer simulation methods gfdl s accomplishments include the development of the first climate models to study global warming the first comprehensive ocean prediction codes and the first dynamical models with significant skill in hurricane track and intensity predictions much current research within the laboratory is focused around the development of earth system models for assessment of natural and human-induced climate change

major accomplishments 

the first global numerical simulations of the atmosphere  defining the basic structure of the numerical weather prediction and climate models that are still in use today throughout the world the first numerical simulation of the world ocean the initial definition and further elaborations of many of the central issues in global warming research including water vapor feedback polar amplification of temperature change summer mid-continental dryness and cloud feedback the first coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models and the first simulations of global warming using these models  including the above feedback processes and the potential weakening of the atlantic overturning circulation  the development of a state-of-art hurricane model and its transfer to operations in the noaa national weather service and the navy 
scientific groups 
the gfdl has a diverse community of about 300 researchers collaborators and staff with many from britain india china japan france etc the laboratory is currently organized into several scientific groups  listed alphabetically below  as well as a large computer support group atmospheric physics chemistry and climate 
current head  dr hiram levy ii
this group focuses on processes that affect the vertical structure of the atmosphere such as convection and radiation a particular focus is the role of aerosols in climate both through direct effects on the radiative balance and indirect effects on cloud physics climate and ecosystems 
current head  ron stouffer
this group focuses on interactions between the physical climate and biogeochemical systems both in the land and ocean development of gfdl s earth system model is centered in this group climate diagnostics 
current head  dr ngar-chung  gabriel  lau
this group focuses on comparing models with observations developing observational datasets that can be compared with models and using models to isolate key processes that regulate interannual variability in the ocean and atmosphere climate change variability and prediction 
current head  dr tom delworth
the largest group in the lab centers on the development of numerical models for predictions and projections of climate on seasonal-to-centennial time scales major projects include the development of el nino predictions for seasonal forecasting and the production of ipcc-class climate models oceans and climate 
current head  dr robert hallberg
this group focuses on the role played by the oceans in the large-scale climate system and on developing state-of-the-art numerical codes to simulate the ocean weather and atmospheric dynamics 
current head  dr 
this group focuses on the dynamics of the atmosphere with particular emphasis on the interactions between waves and turbulence and the large-scale flow development of gfdl s hurricane model is supported from this group facilities 
the gfdl is located at  s forrestal campus in princeton nj since march 2011 the gfdl no longer possesses an on-site  they instead utilize a   supercomputer with over 30,000  which is currently located at  in   this contrasts from their previous systems architecture which consisted of eight   computers each housing 1024  hardware updates occur on average every 18 months the gfdl has been utilizing high performance computing systems for numerical modeling since the 1950s alumni
