hurricane bob originated from the remnants of a   to the southeast of  on august12 the system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the  by august15th satellite analysis of the system found a weak  a couple hundred miles east of the bahamas operationally the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600utc on august16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 37mph  60km h  after post-storm analysis it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around 0000utc several hours after being designated the system began to develop   roughly 18hours after being declared a depression the   nhc  upgraded it to a tropical storm giving it the name bob at this time bob was situated roughly 140mi  225km  northeast of  the storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the deep layer mean flow it was embedded within a deepening  over the eastern united states was forecast to turn the storm toward the north on august16 this turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated the storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced from the   however upper-level  was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the  later that day bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719utc following this reading the nhc upgraded the storm to a  on the  shortly after the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a   over the atlantic and the trough over the southeastern united states by august18 the nhc noted that the hurricane was asymmetrical having uneven distribution of the wind radii later that day deep convection continued to form and an eye later appeared on satellite imagery early the next day the eye became increasingly defined as the center of bob passed roughly 35mi  55km  from the north carolina coastline by 0600utc  recorded flight level winds of 140mph  225km h  corresponding to surface winds of 115mph  185km h  at this time the  of the storm also decreased to 950mbar  hpa  28.05inhg  the lowest pressure recorded during the storm after attaining this intensity the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at 25mph  35km h  steered by the trough over the southeast united states an upper-level cutoff low over the  and the subtropical ridge over the atlantic

the track of hurricane bob by august19 was similar to that of  in  another major hurricane that impacted new england significantly cooler  in the path of the hurricane resulted in weakening leading to the eye becoming cloud-filled later on august19 the western portion of the eyewall brushed the eastern tip of  around 1800utc the center of bob made landfall near  with winds of 100mph  155km h  making it a category 2 hurricane the storm quickly weakened as it tracked through  and  before entering the  around 0130utc on august20 the now weakened tropical storm bob made another landfall near  with winds of 70mph  110km h  later that day bob had crossed through  and part of   and entered the  around 1800utc the former hurricane transitioned into an  early the next day the storm passed over northern  before re-entering the atlantic ocean rapidly tracking eastward the storm briefly weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression on august22 after restrengthening to tropical storm-force winds the remnants of bob turned towards the southeast and slowed once more the extratropical system weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression  however it did not re-intensify the storm slowly tracked towards the east before dissipating off the coast of  on august29 preparations
several hours after the declaration of tropical storm bob on august16 the  issued a  for the northwestern bahamas between the islands of  and  after the storm turned northward this warning was discontinued as tropical storm-force winds were no longer expected to affect the islands shortly before bob was upgraded to a hurricane on august17 the nhc issued a  for coastal areas of  between  northward to  roughly four hours after this watch it was upgraded to a  a new hurricane watch was issued late on august17 encompassing areas between virginia beach northward to   this watch was also upgraded to a warning on august18 as bob paralleled the mid-atlantic coastline during the afternoon hours a tropical storm warning was declared for areas in the  area including  a new extensive hurricane warning was issued late on august18 as forecasts showed bob moving directly over southern new england the warning covered areas between cape henlopen delaware to  including  and  early on august19 all watches and warnings south of  were discontinued and the hurricane warning was extended northward to encompass areas south of  the  began issuing warnings for  later that day   and  were placed under wind and heavy rain warnings by the morning of august20 all watches and warnings in the united states were discontinued  however a brief tropical storm warning was declared for coastal maine between  and eastport before the remnants of bob moved through eastern canada the advisories for  were later discontinued after the system moved out of the region mid-atlantic states and the carolinas
