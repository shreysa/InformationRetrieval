the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  is a scientific and  under the auspices of the  set up at the request of member governments dedicated to the task of providing the world with an objective scientific view of  and its political and economic impacts it was first established in 1988 by two united nations organizations the   wmo  and the   unep  and later endorsed by the  through resolution 43 53 membership of the ipcc is open to all members of the wmo and unep the ipcc produces reports that support the   unfccc  which is the main international treaty on climate change the ultimate objective of the unfccc is to  stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic  i.e human-induced  interference with the climate system  ipcc reports cover  the scientific technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change  and options for  and  
the ipcc does not carry out its own original research nor does it do the work of monitoring climate or related phenomena itself the ipcc  which includes  and non-peer-reviewed sources thousands of scientists and other experts contribute  on a voluntary basis without payment from the ipcc  to writing and reviewing reports which are then reviewed by governments ipcc reports contain a   which is subject to line-by-line approval by delegates from all participating governments typically this involves the governments of more than 120 countries the ipcc provides an internationally accepted authority on climate change producing reports which have the agreement of leading climate scientists and the consensus of participating governments the  was shared in equal parts between the ipcc and

origins and aims 
the ipcc developed from an international scientific body the  set up in 1985 by the  the   unep  and the   wmo  to provide recommendations based on current research this small group of scientists lacked the resources to cover the increasingly complex interdisciplinary nature of climate science the  and  wanted an international convention to agree restrictions on  and the   was concerned about unrestrained influence from independent scientists or from united nations bodies including unep and the wmo the u.s government was the main force in forming the ipcc as an autonomous intergovernmental body in which scientists took part both as experts on the science and as official representatives of their governments to produce reports which had the firm backing of all the leading scientists worldwide researching the topic and which then had to gain consensus agreement from every one of the participating governments in this way it was formed as a hybrid between a scientific body and an intergovernmental political organisation the principles that the ipcc operates under are set out in the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the unfccc process the aims of the ipcc are to assess scientific information relevant to 

human-induced climate change the impacts of human-induced climate change options for adaptation and mitigation 
organization 
korean economist  has been the chair of the ipcc since october 8 2015 following the election of the new ipcc bureau before this election the ipcc was led by his vice-chair  who was designated acting chair after the resignation of  in february 2015 the previous chairs were  elected in may 2002   in 1997  and  in 1988 the chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs working group co-chairs and a secretariat the ipcc panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged plenary sessions of the ipcc and ipcc  are held at the level of government representatives non governmental and intergovernmental organizations may be allowed to attend as observers sessions of the ipcc bureau workshops expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts after the opening ceremonies closed plenary sessions were held the meeting report states there were 322 persons in attendance at sessions with about seven-eighths of participants being from governmental organizations there are several major groups 

ipcc panel  meets in plenary session about once a year and controls the organization s structure procedures and work program the panel is the ipcc corporate entity chair  elected by the panel secretariat  oversees and manages all activities supported by unep and wmo bureau  elected by the panel chaired by the chair 30 members include ipcc vice-chairs co-chairs and vice-chairs of working groups and task force working groups  each has two co-chairs one from the developed and one from developing world and a technical support unit 
working group i  assesses scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change co-chairs   and panmao zhai
working group ii  assesses vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change consequences and adaptation options co-chairs  hans-otto prtner and debra roberts

task force on national greenhouse gas inventories

the ipcc receives funding through the ipcc trust fund established in 1989 by the   unep  and the   wmo  costs of the secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the wmo while unep meets the cost of the depute secretary annual cash contributions to the trust fund are made by the wmo by unep and by ipcc members  the scale of payments is determined by the ipcc panel which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget the organisation is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the wmo assessment reports 

the ipcc has published five comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science as well as a number of special reports on particular topics these reports are prepared by teams of relevant researchers selected by the bureau from government nominations drafts of these reports are made available for comment in open review processes to which anyone may contribute 
the ipcc published its  in 1990 a supplementary report in 1992 a  in 1995 a  in 2001 a  in 2007 and a  in 2014 each assessment report is in three volumes corresponding to working groups i ii and iii unqualified  the ipcc report  is often used to mean the working group i report which covers the basic science of climate change scope and preparation of the reports 
the ipcc does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data lead authors of ipcc reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources according to ipcc guidelines authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources  the  grey literature  provided that they are of sufficient quality examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations and industry journals each subsequent ipcc report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required there are generally three stages in the review process

review comments are in an open archive for at least five years there are several types of endorsement which documents receive 

approval material has been subjected to detailed line by line discussion and agreement 
working group summaries for policymakers are approved by their working groups synthesis report summary for policymakers is approved by panel 

adoption endorsed section by section  and not line by line  
panel adopts overview chapters of methodology reports panel adopts ipcc synthesis report 

acceptance not been subject to line by line discussion and agreement but presents a comprehensive objective and balanced view of the subject matter 
working groups accept their reports task force reports are accepted by the panel working group summaries for policymakers are accepted by the panel after group approval 


the panel is responsible for the ipcc and its endorsement of reports allows it to ensure they meet ipcc standards there have been a range of commentaries on the ipcc s procedures examples of which are discussed later in the article  see also   some of these comments have been supportive while others have been critical some commentators have suggested changes to the ipcc s procedures authors 

each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material a chapter typically has two  coordinating lead authors  ten to fifteen  lead authors  and a somewhat larger number of  contributing authors  the coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements and reporting to the working group chairs lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters contributing authors prepare text graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors authors for the ipcc reports are chosen from a list of researchers prepared by governments and participating organisations and by the working group task force bureaux as well as other experts known through their published work the choice of authors aims for a range of views expertise and geographical representation ensuring representation of experts from developing and developed countries and countries with economies in transition first assessment report 
main article  
the ipcc first assessment report was completed in 1990 and served as the basis of the unfccc the executive summary of the wg i summary for policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the  resulting on average in an additional warming of the  s surface they calculate with confidence that co2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect they predict that under a  business as usual   bau  scenario global mean temperature will increase by about 0.3c per decade during the  century they judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6c over the last 100 years broadly consistent with prediction of climate models but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability the unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more supplementary report of 1992 
the 1992 supplementary report was an update requested in the context of the negotiations on the unfccc at the   united nations conference on environment and development  in  in 1992 the major conclusion was that research since 1990 did  not affect our fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse effect and either confirm or do not justify alteration of the major conclusions of the first ipcc scientific assessment  it noted that transient  time-dependent  simulations which had been very preliminary in the far were now improved but did not include aerosol or ozone changes second assessment report

the third assessment report  tar  was completed in 2001 and consists of four reports three of them from its working groups 

working group i  the scientific basis
working group ii  impacts adaptation and vulnerability
working group iii  mitigation
synthesis report

a number of the tar s conclusions are given quantitative estimates of how probable it is that they are correct e.g greater than 66 probability of being correct these are   probabilities which are based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence  robust findings  of the tar synthesis report include 

 observations show earth s surface is warming globally 1990s very likely warmest decade in   atmospheric concentrations of anthropogenic  i.e human-emitted   have increased substantially since the mid-20th century most of the observed warming is  likely   greater than 66 probability based on expert judgement  due to human activities projections based on the  suggest warming over the 21st century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years  projected climate change will have beneficial and adverse effects on both environmental and socio-economic systems but the larger the changes and the rate of change in climate the more the adverse effects predominate 
  and  are vulnerable to climate change and other stresses  as illustrated by observed impacts of recent regional temperature changes  and some will be irreversibly damaged or lost 
 greenhouse gas emission reduction   actions would lessen the pressures on natural and human systems from climate change 
   has the potential to reduce adverse  and can often produce immediate ancillary benefits but will not prevent all damages  an example of adaptation to climate change is building  in response to  
comments on the tar 
in 2001 16 national  issued a joint statement on climate change the joint statement was made by the  the  the  the  the caribbean academy of sciences the  the  the  the  the indonesian academy of sciences the    italy  the academy of sciences malaysia the  the  and the   uk  the statement also published as an editorial in the journal  stated  we support the  tar s  conclusion that it is at least 90 certain that temperatures will continue to rise with average global surface temperature projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8c above 1990 levels by 2100  the tar has also been endorsed by the   and   refer to   in 2001 the   us nrc  produced a report that assessed working group i s  wgi  contribution to the tar us nrc  2001   generally agrees  with the wgi assessment and describes the full wgi report as an  admirable summary of research activities in climate science  ipcc author  has made a number of criticisms of the tar among his criticisms lindzen has stated that the wgi summary for policymakers  spm  does not faithfully summarize the full wgi report for example lindzen states that the spm understates the uncertainty associated with   who was a co-chair of tar wgi has responded to lindzen s criticisms of the spm houghton has stressed that the spm is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world s governments and that any changes to the spm must be supported by scientific evidence ipcc author  has also commented on the wgi spm trenberth has stated that during the drafting of the wgi spm some government delegations attempted to  blunt and perhaps obfuscate the messages in the report  however trenberth concludes that the spm is a  reasonably balanced summary  us nrc  2001  concluded that the wgi spm and technical summary are  consistent  with the full wgi report us nrc  2001  stated 

   the full  report is adequately summarized in the technical summary the full wgi report and its technical summary are not specifically directed at policy the summary for policymakers reflects less emphasis on communicating the basis for uncertainty and a stronger emphasis on areas of major concern associated with human-induced climate change this change in emphasis appears to be the result of a summary process in which scientists work with policy makers on the document written responses from u.s coordinating and lead scientific authors to the committee indicate however that  a  no changes were made without the consent of the convening lead authors  this group represents a fraction of the lead and contributing authors  and  b  most changes that did occur lacked significant impact 
fourth assessment report 
main article  
the fourth assessment report  ar4  was published in 2007 like previous assessment reports it consists of four reports 

working group i  the physical science basis
working group ii  impacts adaptation and vulnerability
working group iii  mitigation
synthesis report

people from over 130 countries contributed to the ipcc fourth assessment report which took 6 years to produce contributors to ar4 included more than 2500 scientific expert reviewers more than 800 contributing authors and more than 450 lead authors  robust findings  of the synthesis report include 

 warming of the climate system is unequivocal as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level  most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is  very likely   greater than 90 probability based on expert judgement  due to human activities 

 impacts  will very likely increase due to increased frequencies and intensities of some extreme weather events  

 anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries even if ghg emissions were to be reduced sufficiently for ghg concentrations to stabilise due to the time scales associated with climate processes and feedbacks  stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations is discussed in   some planned adaptation  of human activities  is occurring now  more extensive adaptation is required to reduce vulnerability to climate change   unmitigated climate change would in the long term be likely to exceed the capacity of natural managed and human systems to adapt   many impacts  can be reduced delayed or avoided by mitigation  
global warming projections from ar4 are shown below the projections apply to the end of the 21st century  209099  relative to temperatures at the end of the 20th century  198099  add 0.7c to projections to make them relative to pre-industrial levels instead of 198099 descriptions of the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios can be found in  
 likely  means greater than 66 probability of being correct based on expert judgement response to ar4 
several  have referred to and or reiterated some of the conclusions of ar4 these include 

joint-statements made in 2007 2008 and 2009 by the science academies of brazil china india mexico south africa and the  nations  the  g8 5  publications by the  a joint-statement made in 2007 by the  a statement made in 2010 by the inter academy medical panel this statement has been signed by 43 scientific academies 
the   pbl et al 2009  2010  has carried out two reviews of ar4 these reviews are generally supportive of ar4 s conclusions pbl  2010  make some recommendations to improve the ipcc process a literature assessment by the us national research council  us nrc 2010  concludes 

climate change is occurring is caused largely by human activities and poses significant risks forand in many cases is already affectinga broad range of human and natural systems     this conclusion is based on a substantial array of scientific evidence including recent work and is consistent with the conclusions of recent assessments by the u.s global change research program    the intergovernmental panel on climate changes fourth assessment report    and other assessments of the state of scientific knowledge on climate change 
some errors have been found in the ipcc ar4 working group ii report two errors include the melting of    see   and dutch land area that is below sea level fifth assessment report 
main article  
the ipcc s fifth assessment report  ar5  was completed in 2014 ar5 followed the same general format as of ar4 with three working group reports and a synthesis report the working group i report  wg1  was published in september 2013 conclusions of ar5 are summarized below 

working group i


 warming of the climate system is unequivocal and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia   atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years  human influence on the climate system is clear it is extremely likely  95-100 probability  that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951-2010 

working group ii


 increasing magnitudes of  warming increase the likelihood of severe pervasive and irreversible impacts 
 a first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability 
 the overall risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change 


working group iii


without new policies to mitigate climate change projections suggest an increase in global mean temperature in 2100 of  relative to pre-industrial levels   values  the range is 2.5 to 7.8c including climate uncertainty  the current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions is not consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2c relative to pre-industrial levels pledges made as part of the  are broadly consistent with cost-effective scenarios that give a  likely  chance  66-100 probability  of limiting global warming  in 2100  to below 3c relative to pre-industrial levels 
representative concentration pathways 
projections in ar5 are based on    rcps  the rcps are consistent with a wide range of possible changes in future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions projected changes in global mean surface temperature and sea level are given in the main  special reports 
in addition to climate assessment reports the ipcc is publishing special reports on specific topics the preparation and approval process for all ipcc special reports follows the same procedures as for ipcc assessment reports in the year 2011 two ipcc special report were finalized the special report on   srren  and the special report on managing risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation  srex  both special reports were requested by governments special report on emissions scenarios  sres 
the   sres  is a report by the ipcc which was published in 2000 the sres contains   of future changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and  one of the uses of the sres scenarios is to project future changes in climate e.g changes in global mean temperature the sres scenarios were used in the ipcc s third and fourth assessment reports the sres scenarios are  baseline   or  reference  scenarios which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions  e.g the  to the   sres emissions projections are broadly comparable in range to the baseline projections that have been developed by the scientific community comments on the sres 
there have been a number of comments on the sres parson et al  2007  stated that the sres represented  a substantial advance from prior scenarios  at the same time there have been criticisms of the sres the most prominently publicized criticism of sres focused on the fact that all but one of the participating models compared gross domestic product  gdp  across regions using   mer  instead of the more correct   ppp  approach this criticism is discussed in the  special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation  srren 
this  assesses existing literature on  for the mitigation of climate change it was published in 2012 and covers the six most important renewable energy technologies as well as their integration into present and future energy systems it also takes into consideration the environmental and social consequences associated with these technologies the cost and strategies to overcome technical as well as non-technical obstacles to their application and diffusion the full report in pdf form is found here  
more than 130 authors from all over the world contributed to the preparation of ipcc special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation  srren  on a voluntary basis  not to mention more than 100 scientists who served as contributing authors special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation  srex 
the  was published in 2012 it assesses the effect that climate change has on the threat of natural disasters and how nations can better manage an expected change in the frequency of occurrence and intensity of severe weather patterns it aims to become a resource for decision-makers to prepare more effectively for managing the risks of these events a potentially important area for consideration is also the detection of trends in extreme events and the attribution of these trends to human influence the full report 594 pages in pdf form may be found here  
more than 80 authors 19 review editors and more than 100 contributing authors from all over the world contributed to the preparation of srex methodology reports 
within ipcc the national greenhouse gas inventory program develops methodologies to estimate emissions of  this has been undertaken since 1991 by the ipcc wgi in close collaboration with the  and the  the objectives of the national greenhouse gas inventory program are 

to develop and refine an internationally agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and removals  and
to encourage the widespread use of this methodology by countries participating in the ipcc and by signatories of the unfccc 
revised 1996 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories 
the 1996 guidelines for national greenhouse gas investories provide the methodological basis for the estimation of national greenhouse gas  over time these guidelines have been completed with good practice reports  good practice guidance and uncertainty management in national greenhouse gas inventories and good practice guidance for land use land-use change and forestry the 1996 guidelines and the two good practice reports are to be used by parties to the unfccc and to the  in their annual submissions of national greenhouse gas inventories 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories 
the 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories is the latest version of these emission estimation methodologies including a large number of default emission factors  although the ipcc prepared this new version of the guidelines on request of the parties to the unfccc the methods have not yet been officially accepted for use in national greenhouse gas emissions reporting under the unfccc and the kyoto protocol activities 
the ipcc concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the unfccc process while the preparation of the assessment reports is a major ipcc function it also supports other activities such as the data distribution centre and the national greenhouse gas inventories programme required under the unfccc this involves publishing default  which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption industrial production and so on the ipcc also often answers inquiries from the unfccc subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice  sbsta  nobel peace prize

in december 2007 the ipcc was awarded the   for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change  the award is shared with former u.s vice-president  for his work on climate change and the documentary  criticisms 
there is  for the ipcc in the  which is reflected in publications by other scientific bodies and experts however criticisms of the ipcc have been made since 2010 the ipcc has come under yet unparalleled public and political scrutiny the global  approach has been challenged internally and externally with the 2009   climategate  an important  but not sole  threshold it has been deemed an  with results for both the quality and the impact of the ipcc work as such projected date of melting of himalayan glaciers 
main article  
a paragraph in the 2007 working group ii report  impacts adaptation and vulnerability  chapter 10 included a projection that himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035

glaciers in the himalaya are receding faster than in any other part of the world  see table 10.9  and if the present rate continues the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the earth keeps warming at the current rate its total area will likely shrink from the present 500,000 to 100,000 km2 by the year 2035  wwf 2005  
this projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers the ipcc has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust they expressed regret for  the poor application of well-established ipcc procedures in this instance  the date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the ipcc from the wwf report which has misquoted its own source an  report  variations of snow and ice in the past and at present on a global and regional scale   responded in an interview with science overstatement of effects 
former ipcc chairman  said regarding the himalayan glaciers estimation  the mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact that is worrying the ipcc needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened  martin parry a climate expert who had been co-chair of the ipcc working group ii said that  what began with a single unfortunate error over himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance  and the ipcc had investigated the other alleged mistakes which were  generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment  emphasis of the  hockey stick  graph

some critics have contended that the ipcc reports tend to be  by consistently underestimating the pace and impacts of global warming and report only the  lowest common denominator  findings on 1 february 2007 the eve of the publication of ipcc s major report on climate a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last ipcc report in 2001 the study compared ipcc 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations over the six years studied the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by ipcc s 2001 projection and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the ipcc projection another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the ipcc far from overstating dangers and risks have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels when the researchers  analysis was  applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.51.4 m  above 1990 levels these values are much greater than the 988cm as projected by the ipcc itself in its third assessment report published in 2001  this may have been due in part to the expanding human understanding of climate greg holland from the  who reviewed a multi-meter  study by  noted there is no doubt that the sea level rise within the ipcc is a very conservative number so the truth lies somewhere between ipcc and jim in reporting criticism by some scientists that ipcc s then-impending january 2007 report understates certain risks particularly sea level rises an ap story quoted  professor of physics and oceanography at potsdam university as saying  in a way it is one of the strengths of the ipcc to be very conservative and cautious and not overstate any climate change risk  in his december 2006 book  and in an interview on  on 31 january 2007 energy expert  noted that the  is already out of date and omits recent observations and factors contributing to global warming such as the release of greenhouse gases from thawing tundra political influence on the ipcc has been documented by the release of a memo by exxonmobil to the bush administration and its effects on the ipcc s leadership the memo led to strong bush administration lobbying evidently at the behest of exxonmobil to oust  a climate scientist from the ipcc chairmanship and to have him replaced by pachauri who was seen at the time as more mild-mannered and industry-friendly ipcc processes 
 a long-time participant in the ipcc and coordinating lead author of the fifth assessment report conceded in  s state of the planet 20082009 some limitations of the ipcc consensus approach and asks for concurring smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous ipcc assessment reports it has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the ipcc process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions or to improve statements about uncertainties the ipcc process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges  compare   in case of the  global regulation based on the  has been successful in case of climate change the  failed the ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the ipcc process the lockstep situation of the ipcc is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different if not opposing goals the underlying linear model of policy-making of more knowledge we have the better the political response will be is being doubted according to sheldon ungar s comparison with global warming the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties the ozone case communicated to lay persons  with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the   and related to  immediate risks with everyday relevance  while the  sees no imminent danger the stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts in case of the ipcc conclusions and the failure of the kyoto protocol varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem in the uk a report for a house of lords committee asked to urge the ipcc to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the  ordered by the uk government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change outdatedness of reports 
since the ipcc does not carry out its own research it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report s final release in principle this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an ipcc report cannot be included in an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science however there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next 
the submission deadlines for the fourth assessment report  ar4  differed for the reports of each working group deadlines for the working group i report were adjusted during the drafting and review process in order to ensure that reviewers had access to unpublished material being cited by the authors the final deadline for cited publications was 24 july 2006 the final wg i report was released on 30 april 2007 and the final ar4 synthesis report was released on 17 november 2007  the ipcc chair admitted at the launch of this report that since the ipcc began work on it scientists have recorded  much stronger trends in climate change  like the unforeseen dramatic melting of polar ice in the summer of 2007 and added  that means you better start with intervention much earlier  burden on participating scientists 
scientists who participate in the ipcc assessment process do so without any compensation other than the normal salaries they receive from their home institutions the process is labor-intensive diverting time and resources from participating scientists  research programs concerns have been raised that the large uncompensated time commitment and disruption to their own research may discourage qualified scientists from participating lack of error correction after publication 
in may 2010 pachauri noted that the ipcc currently had no process for responding to errors or flaws once it issued a report the problem according to pachauri was that once a report was issued the panels of scientists producing the reports were disbanded proposed organizational overhaul 
in february 2010 in response to controversies regarding claims in the  five climate scientists  all contributing or lead ipcc report authors  wrote in the journal  calling for changes to the ipcc they suggested a range of new organizational options from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a   living  wikipedia-ipcc other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference interacademy council review 
in march 2010 at the invitation of the united nations secretary-general and the chair of the ipcc the   iac  was asked to review the ipcc s processes for developing its reports the iac panel chaired by  convened on 14 may 2010 and released its report on 1 september 2010 the iac found that  the ipcc assessment process has been successful overall  the panel however made seven formal recommendations for improving the ipcc s assessment process including 

establish an executive committee 
elect an executive director whose term would only last for one assessment 
encourage review editors to ensure that all reviewer comments are adequately considered and genuine controversies are adequately reflected in the assessment reports 
adopt a better process for responding to reviewer comments 
working groups should use a qualitative level-of-understanding scale in the summary for policy makers and technical summary 
 quantitative probabilities  as in the likelihood scale  should be used to describe the probability of well-defined outcomes only when there is sufficient evidence  and
implement a communications plan that emphasizes transparency and establish guidelines for who can speak on behalf of the organization 
the panel also advised that the ipcc avoid appearing to advocate specific policies in response to its scientific conclusions commenting on the iac report nature news noted that  the proposals were met with a largely favourable response from climate researchers who are eager to move on after the media scandals and credibility challenges that have rocked the united nations body during the past nine months  archiving 
papers and electronic files of certain working groups of the ipcc including reviews and comments on drafts of their assessment reports are archived at the  in the harvard library endorsements of the ipcc 
various scientific bodies have issued official statements endorsing and concurring with the findings of the ipcc 
joint   statement of 2001  the work of the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  represents the  of the international  on climate change science we recognise ipcc as the world s most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes and we endorse its method of achieving this consensus    we concur with the climate science assessment of the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  in 2001  we endorse the conclusions of the ipcc assessment 
  cmos endorses the process of periodic climate science assessment carried out by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and supports the conclusion in its  which states that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate 
  the intergovernmental panel on climate change    is the main representative of the global scientific community    ipcc third assessment report    represents the state-of-the-art of climate science supported by the major science academies around the world and by the vast majority of scientific researchers and investigations as documented by the peer-reviewed scientific literature   the  represents the most comprehensive international scientific assessment ever conducted this assessment reflects the current collective knowledge on the climate system its evolution to date and its anticipated future development    usa   internationally the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  is the most senior and authoritative body providing scientific advice to global policy makers    the   conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue    the ipcc should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy climate and sustainability   in response to the release of the  referred to the ipcc as  the world s best climate scientists  stratigraphy commission of the   the most authoritative assessment of climate change in the near future is provided by the inter-governmental panel for climate change
