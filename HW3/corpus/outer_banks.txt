geography 
the outer banks is a string of peninsulas and barrier islands separating the atlantic ocean from mainland  from north to south the largest of these include    which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes     and the  over time the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up often during a breach created during violent storms and older inlets close usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of  the outer banks stretch southward from  in  down the north carolina coastline sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the outer banks generations of north carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state s three prominent capes    and  other sources limit the definition to two capes   and   and coastal areas in four counties    and   some authors include carteret s  and  in their descriptions while others exclude  still other references restrict the definition to the northern three counties of currituck dare and hyde the abbreviations obx  outer banks  and sobx  southern outer banks  are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers t-shirts and other items to vacationers obx which originated first is generally used in the northern outer banks sobx is used primarily in  which is also known as the  the northern part of the outer banks from  northward is actually a part of the  mainland since the northern inlets of bodie island and currituck banks no longer exist it is separated by the  and the  which passes through the  occupying much of the mainland west of the outer banks road access to the northern outer banks is cut off between  and  with communities such as  accessible only by  vehicles  links most of the popular outer banks communities in this section of the coast the easternmost point is cape point at  on hatteras island site of the  the outer banks are not anchored to offshore  like some other barrier islands and as a consequence they often suffer significant beach  during major storms in fact their location jutting out into the atlantic makes them the mostprone area north of  for both landfalling storms and brushing storms offshore hatteras island was cut in half on september 18 2003 when  washed a 2,000 foot  600 m  wide and 15 foot  5 m  deep channel called  through the community of hatteras village on the southern end of the island the tear was subsequently repaired and restored by sand dredging by the  it was cut off once again in 2011 by  access to the island was largely limited to boat access only from august to late october until another temporary bridge could be built vegetation 
the vegetation of the outer banks varies in the northeast part of the outer banks from  southward past the  border to  the main types of vegetation are sea grasses beach grasses and other beach plants including  on the atlantic side and   and grasses on the sound side with areas of pine andcovered   and  can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach   were once indigenous to the entire outer banks and they are still successfully planted and grown its current most northerly known native stand is on  in currituck county from  southward the vegetation does include that of the northeastern outer banks such as  yucca aloifolia and yucca gloriosa  however the main vegetation consists of cabbage palmetto   which can be found in the north although they are native in the southern part of the outer banks specifically prevelent from cape hatteras and all points southward  and  are also planted widely throughout the outer banks  although they are not indigenous to the area a wide variety of native plants can be found at the elizabethan gardens in  on  the gardens are open year round 7 days a week weather 
the outer banks have unusual weather patterns because of their unique geographical location as the islands are jutted out from the eastern seaboard into the atlantic gulf stream the outer banks has a predisposition to be affected by hurricanes nor easters  usually in the form of rain and rarely snow or mixed precipitation  and other ocean-driven storms the winters are typically milder than in inland areas averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s and is more frequently overcast than in the summer however the exposure of the outer banks makes them prone to higher winds often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas the summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s depending on the time of the summer the spring and fall are typically milder seasons the fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by water although snow is possible averaging from 3 inches in the north to less than 1 2 inch per year in the south there are many times when years pass between snowfalls the majority of nor easters are  born  off the coasts of the outer banks culture

the outer banks were first settled by english european colonial settlers many of whom still have descendants living on the islands to this day before bridges were built in the 1930s the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland this helped to preserve the maritime culture and the  or  which sounds more like an english accent than it does an american accent many  bankers  have often been mistaken for being from england or ireland when traveling to areas outside of the outer banks the brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the outer banks with it being the thickest on ocracoke island and  some residents of the outer banks known as wreckers made part of their living by scavenging or by luring ships to their destruction horses with  tied to their necks would be walked along the beach  the lanterns  up and down motion would appear to ships to represent clear water and a ship ahead  the unsuspecting captain would then drive his ship ashore following this false light the islands are home to herds of feral horses sometimes called    which according to local legend are descended from spanish  washed ashore centuries ago in shipwrecks populations are found on ocracoke island shackleford banks currituck banks and in the  estuarine sanctuary  was the last refuge of  edward teach better known as  it is also where the infamous pirate was killed november 22 1718 in a fierce battle with troops from virginia the outer banks is home to yaupon holly   the roasted leaves of which were brewed into a high caffeine beverage called  by the  the outer banks may be one of the few places where it is still consumed fishing 

the outer banks offers a multitude of fishing options for tourists as well as locals there has been a long history of fishing in the outer banks dating back to the end of the 17th century  ravaged the coast for the majority of the 1600s but once they were ridden the local settlers used fishing as their lifeline then in the mid-19th century large-scale commercial fishing erupted mostly due to the construction of the albemarle and  which simplified shipping methods for fishermen  became the cash-crop of the outer banks and blossomed it into a popular tourist destination in modern times tourists will flock to the area just for the abundance of fishing opportunities anglers otherwise known as fishermen have a wide range of fishing methods some of these methods date back to when the first settlers arrived to choose from in the outer banks 
fly fishing
this was brought about in the 1950s when modern fly fishing experts like  and  were successfully catching a variety of gamefish on the flats of the  and on the  which is included in the stretch of the outer banks modern fly fishers in the outer banks pursue a variety of gamefish from  to  and  brackish fishing
this is a separate type of fishing than complete saltwater because of the abundance of new species that are able to live in brackish water the outer banks has multiple sounds that receive water from the  and many north carolina fresh-water rivers creating an  for many types of fish including   and  offshore fishing
thriving in the outer banks this is the type of fishing this area is known for offshore fishing is the method of heading out to sea to the  where giant species such as  tuna and  lurk anglers can book charters or use their own personal boat but a larger boat is necessary to reach the deep water where the big fish are prevalent inshore fishing
guides local to the outer banks will often escort new anglers around the area to sounds and piers where they are guaranteed a catch whether the customer is a novice or veteran with their fishing skills the inshore guide is someone that is there to help pier fishing
the outer banks are one of the few coastal areas left with more than one  along the coast so anglers attract to the area for an opportunity to pier fish pier fishing is an easy way for anglers to get a little off-shore mixed with some inshore fishing it is where fishermen can catch any type of fish they please as long as it is the season for it 
the outer banks are a popular destination for bottom fish like  and  these two types of fish are caught throughout the year the peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of may if the angler is solely searching for top water fish then late may and june would be the ideal time to fish especially if they are searching for  in the offseason or winter months the true fishermen are out searching for        and  in the spring the popular catches are   sea bass bluefish bluefin and  oysters snapper striped bass red drum  sea mullet king mackerel and  late spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top-water fish to move into the coastal waters near the outer banks because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water the top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water plus they will start to migrate back north as the coastal waters to the south become too hot the waters farther north will warm to their desired temperatures yet in the prime tourist season of the summer fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as   dolphin wahoo  king mackerel bluefish tuna        spot croaker  and sea mullet by the fall most tourists have started to leave but fishermen are still out searching for snapper  bluefish king mackerel grouper tuna oysters striped bass sea mullet spot  speckled trout flounder and shrimp the prime season for fall fishing is late september to october 23 though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast  there is still some big game fish left most of these fish are vacating back to the south for the warm waters this makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky colder water communities
