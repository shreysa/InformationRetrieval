etymology
ohio derives from the iroquois language as their name for the ohio river  alleghany river ohi yo this is pronounced  oh-hee-yoh  with the i sound being held an extra second folk etymology claims that this translates as  beautiful river  however it appears that the word can be broken down as  o   pronoun prefix translates as  it    implies that whatever is about to follow it is considered a permanent condition of the item   hih   verb to spill     gihedenyo   noun creek stream  that being said the most sensible translation ought to be  continuously-spilling creek  or  continuously-giving creek  the word for creek is used instead of river since it still flows into a larger river the mississippi the common accent of ohio shifts regularly so there are multiple different accepted ways of saying ohio that have been common throughout the last century such as  oh-hai-yuh   uh-hai-yoh     uh-hai-yuh  the most recent shift that is beginning to surface sounds something along the lines of  wh-hai-yuh
