new persian 




 s 


 new persian  is conventionally divided into three stages 

early new persian  8th 9th centuries 
classical persian  10th18th centuries 
contemporary persian  19th century to present 

early new persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of contemporary persian as the morphology and to a lesser extent the lexicon of the language have remained relatively stable early new persian 
 new persian  is taken to replace middle persian in the course of the 8th to 9th centuries under  with the decline of the abbasids began the reestablishment of persian national life and persians laid the foundations for a renaissance in the realm of letters new persian as an independent literary language first emerges in  through the adaptation of the spoken form of sassanian middle persian court language called  the cradle of the persian literary renaissance lay in the east of  in  and  close to the   modern day afghanistan  the mastery of the newer speech having now been transformed from middle into new persian was already complete by the era of the three princely dynasties of iranian origin the   820872    860903  and   874999  and could develop only in range and power of expression abbas of  is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the newer persian tongue and after him the poems of  were among the most famous between the persian-speakers of the time the first poems of the persian language a language historically called dari emerged in afghanistan the first significant persian poet was  he flourished in the 10th century when the samanids were at the height of their power his reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived although little of his poetry has been preserved among his lost works is versified fables collected in the  the language spread geographically from the 11th century on and was the medium through which among others central asian turks became familiar with islam and urban culture new persian was widely used as a trans-regional  a task for which it was particularly suitable due to its relatively simple morphological structure and this situation persisted until at least 19th century in the late middle ages new islamic literary languages were created on the persian model    and urdu which are regarded as  structural daughter languages  of persian classical persian

phonology

iranian persian has six vowels and twenty-three consonants vowels 




the vowel phonemes of modern tehran persian


historically persian has distinguished length early new persian had a series of five long vowels         and   along with three short vowels    i  and  u  at some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern iran  e  and  i  merged into  i  and  o  and  u  merged into  u  thus older contrasts such as  shr  lion  vs  shr  milk  and  zd  quick  vs  zr  strong  were lost however there are exceptions to this rule and in some words  and  are preserved  which are descendants of the diphthongs  in early new persian  instead of merging into  i  and  u  examples of the exception can be found in words such as    bright  however in dari the archaic distinction of  e  and  i   respectively known as   y-ye majhl and   y-ye ma rf  is still preserved as well as the distinction of  o  and  u   known as   ww-e majhl and   ww-e ma rf  on the other hand in standard tajik the length distinction has disappeared and  i  merged with  i  and  u  with  u  therefore contemporary afghan dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of early new persian according to most studies on the subject  e.g samareh 1977 pisowicz 1985 najafi 2001  the three vowels traditionally considered long  i   u    are currently distinguished from their short counterparts  e   o    by position of articulation rather than by length however there are studies  e.g hayes 1979 windfuhr 1979  that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system with    i  and  u  phonologically long or bimoraic and    e  and  o  phonologically short or monomoraic there are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the iranian system  such as toosarvandani 2004  that offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity which often suggests that modern persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of classical persian and a hypothetical future persian which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature the length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties  including tajik  consonants

morphology 
suffixes predominate persian  though there are a small number of prefixes verbs can express tense and  and they agree with the subject in person and number there is no  in persian and pronouns are not marked for  syntax 
normal declarative sentences are structured as  s   pp   o  v  sentences have optional   and  followed by a compulsory  if the object is specific the object is followed by the word r and precedes prepositional phrases   s   o   r   pp  v vocabulary
