composition 
by volume dry air contains 78.08  20.95  0.93  0.04  and small amounts of other gases air also contains a variable amount of  except for the water vapor content the composition of the troposphere is essentially uniform the source of water vapor is at the earth s surface through the process of  the temperature of the troposphere decreases with  and  decreases strongly as temperature drops hence the amount of water vapor that can exist in the atmosphere decreases strongly with altitude and the proportion of water vapor is normally greatest near the surface of the earth pressure 
the pressure of the atmosphere is maximum at  and decreases with altitude this is because the atmosphere is very nearly in  so that the pressure is equal to the weight of air above a given point the change in pressure with altitude can be equated to the density with the  equation

since temperature in principle also depends on altitude one needs a second equation to determine the pressure as a function of altitude as discussed in the next section temperature

the  of the troposphere generally decreases as altitude increases the rate at which the temperature decreases  is called the environmental lapse rate  elr  the elr is nothing more than the difference in temperature between the surface and the tropopause divided by the height the elr assumes that the air is perfectly still i.e that there is no mixing of the layers of air from vertical convection nor winds that would create turbulence and hence mixing of the layers of air the reason for this temperature difference is that the ground absorbs most of the sun s energy which then heats the lower levels of the atmosphere with which it is in contact meanwhile the radiation of heat at the top of the atmosphere results in the cooling of that part of the atmosphere 
the elr assumes the atmosphere is still but as air is heated it becomes buoyant and rises the dry adiabatic lapse rate accounts for the effect of the expansion of dry air as it rises in the atmosphere and wet adiabatic lapse rates includes the effect of the condensation of water vapor on the lapse rate when a parcel of air rises it expands because the pressure is lower at higher altitudes as the air parcel expands it pushes the surrounding air outward transferring energy in the form of  from that parcel to the atmosphere as energy transfer to a parcel of air by way of heat is very slow it is assumed to not exchange energy by way of  with the environment such a process is called an  process  no energy transfer by way of heat  since the rising parcel of air is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere to make up for the loss the parcel of air is losing energy which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature of the air parcel the reverse of course will be true for a parcel of air that is sinking and is being compressed since the process of compression and expansion of an air parcel can be considered reversible and no energy is transferred into or out of the parcel such a process is considered  meaning that there is no change in entropy as the air parcel rises and falls  since the heat exchanged  is related to the  change  by  the equation governing the temperature as a function of height for a thoroughly mixed atmosphere is



where s is the  the above equation states that the entropy of the atmosphere does not change with height the rate at which temperature decreases with height under such conditions is called the adiabatic  for dry air which is approximately an  we can proceed further the adiabatic equation for an ideal gas is 



where  is the   7 5 for air  combining with the equation for the pressure one arrives at the  


if the air contains  then cooling of the air can cause the water to condense and the behavior is no longer that of an ideal gas if the air is at the  then the rate at which temperature drops with height is called the  more generally the actual rate at which the temperature drops with altitude is called the  in the troposphere the average environmental lapse rate is a drop of about 6.5c for every 1km  1,000 meters  in increased height the environmental lapse rate  the actual rate at which temperature drops with height   is not usually equal to the adiabatic lapse rate  or correspondingly   if the upper air is warmer than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate   then when a parcel of air rises and expands it will arrive at the new height at a lower temperature than its surroundings in this case the air parcel is denser than its surroundings so it sinks back to its original height and the air is stable against being lifted if on the contrary the upper air is cooler than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate then when the air parcel rises to its new height it will have a higher temperature and a lower density than its surroundings and will continue to accelerate upward the troposphere is heated from below by   and  surplus heating and vertical expansion of the troposphere occurs in the tropics at middle latitudes tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 15c at sea level to about 55c at the  at the  tropospheric temperature only decreases from an average of 0c at sea level to about 45c at the tropopause at the  tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 20c at sea level to about 70 to 75c at the tropopause the troposphere is thinner at the poles and thicker at the equator the average thickness of the tropical tropopause is roughly 7 kilometers greater than the average tropopause thickness at the poles tropopause

the tropopause is the boundary region between the troposphere and the  measuring the temperature change with height through the troposphere and the stratosphere identifies the location of the tropopause in the troposphere temperature decreases with altitude in the stratosphere however the temperature remains constant for a while and then increases with altitude the region of the atmosphere where the lapse rate changes from positive  in the troposphere  to negative  in the stratosphere  is defined as the tropopause thus the tropopause is an  and there is little mixing between the two layers of the atmosphere atmospheric flow 
the flow of the atmosphere generally moves in a west to east direction this however can often become interrupted creating a more north to south or south to north flow these scenarios are often described in meteorology as zonal or meridional these terms however tend to be used in reference to localised areas of atmosphere  at a   a fuller explanation of the flow of atmosphere around the earth as a whole can be found in the three-cell model zonal flow 




a  note the dominant west-to-east flow as shown in the 500 hpa height pattern 

a  is the  term meaning that the general flow pattern is west to east along the earth s latitude lines with weak shortwaves embedded in the flow the use of the word  zone  refers to the flow being along the earth s latitudinal  zones  this pattern can buckle and thus become a meridional flow meridional flow 




meridional flow pattern of october 23 2003 note the amplified troughs and ridges in this 500 hpa height pattern 

when the zonal flow buckles the atmosphere can flow in a more longitudinal  or meridional  direction and thus the term   arises meridional flow patterns feature strong amplified troughs of low pressure and ridges of high pressure with more north-south flow in the general pattern than west-to-east flow three-cell model

atmospheric circulation shown with three large cells 

the three cells model of the atmosphere attempts to describe the actual flow of the earth s atmosphere as a whole it divides the earth into the tropical   mid latitude   and polar   regions to describe energy flow and global atmospheric circulation  mass flow  its fundamental principle is that of balance  the energy that the earth absorbs from the sun each year is equal to that which it loses to space by radiation this overall earth energy balance however does not apply in each latitude due to the varying strength of the sun in each  cell  as a result of the tilt of the earth s axis in relation to its orbit the result is a circulation of the atmosphere that transports warm air poleward from the tropics and cold air equatorward from the poles the effect of the three cells is the tendency to even out the heat and moisture in the earth s atmosphere around the planet synoptic scale observations and concepts
forcing is a term used by meteorologists to describe the situation where a change or an event in one part of the atmosphere causes a strengthening change in another part of the atmosphere it is usually used to describe connections between upper middle or lower levels  such as upper-level divergence causing lower level convergence in cyclone formation  but also be to describe such connections over lateral distance rather than height alone in some respects  could be considered a type of forcing divergence and convergence 
an area of convergence is one in which the total mass of air is increasing with time resulting in an increase in pressure at locations below the convergence level  recall that atmospheric pressure is just the total weight of air above a given point  divergence is the opposite of convergence  an area where the total mass of air is decreasing with time resulting in falling pressure in regions below the area of divergence where divergence is occurring in the upper atmosphere there will be air coming in to try to balance the net loss of mass  this is called the principle of mass conservation  and there is a resulting upward motion  positive vertical velocity  another way to state this is to say that regions of upper air divergence are conducive to lower level convergence cyclone formation and positive vertical velocity therefore identifying regions of upper air divergence is an important step in forecasting the formation of a surface low pressure area see also
