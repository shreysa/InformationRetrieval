marilyn s origins were from a tropical wave that formed off the  coast on september 7 large low-level winds were included in the wave s circulation but little convection existed the system continued west for a few days at about 19mph  31km h  next to an anticyclonic aloft on september 12 satellite pictures viewed the disorganized wave and declared it tropical depression fifteen after convection had increased tropical depression fifteen strengthened rapidly becoming tropical storm marilyn six hours later one day after being named marilyn was upgraded to hurricane status while turning on a more northwesterly track for the next few days marilyn s track took it towards the west-northwest and to the northwest due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge marilyn was a  hurricane  it passed 52mi  84km  north of  and  marilyn passed over  and just  and southwest of  on september 14 bringing heavy rains and strong winds with it marilyn continued on its northwesterly track making landfall in the  on september 15 packing winds of 110mph  180km h  a strong category2 strength hurricane the eyewall east-southeast of the center of marilyn passed over  later that day after passing over  marilyn entered back into the atlantic ocean on september 16

a low had formed near marilyn which may have enhanced outflow from the system an eye formed in the center of marilyn and the storm reached a peak intensity of 949  and winds of only 115mph  185km h  a lower-end category3 hurricane at this time marilyn was predicted to peak in wind speeds of 120125mph  190195km h  reconnaissance data found a concentric pair of eyewall wind maxima marilyn started weakening rapidly falling from peak-level winds of 141mph  227km h  down to 102mph  164km h  the central pressure also rose up 20  in only 10hours this rapid weakening was caused by westerly shear and dry air entrained in the system a decaying eyewall and especially cool waters upwelled from the previous powerful storm  as marilyn weakened to category 1 hurricane status and moved north-northwest it passed about 174mi  280km  west of  on september 19 as marilyn encountered more westerly shear it weakened to below hurricane status and made its extratropical transition on september 20 centered in the northeastern atlantic the remnant circulation continued to erratically move through the central atlantic ocean for another 10days before being absorbed by a frontal low on september 30 a hurricane hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail which is unusual for tropical cyclones preparations
