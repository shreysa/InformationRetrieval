it has been alleged that a  simoom  occurred on june 17 1859 in  and  for example local historian walker tompkins wrote that during the morning the temperature hovered around the normal 24 to 27c  75 to 81f  but around 1 p.m strong super hot winds filled with dust began to blow from the direction of the  to the north by 2 p.m the temperature supposedly reached 56c  133f  this temperature was said to have been recorded by an official u.s coastal survey vessel that was operating in the waters just offshore in the  at 5 p.m the temperature had reportedly dropped to 50c  122f  and by 7 p.m the temperature was back to a normal 25c  77f  tompkins provided a supposed quote from a u.s government report saying  calves rabbits and cattle died on their feet fruit fell from trees to the ground scorched on the windward side  all vegetable gardens were ruined a fisherman in a rowboat made it to the  with his face and arms blistered as if he had been exposed to a blast furnace  also according to tompkins local inhabitants were saved from the heat by seeking shelter in the thick  walled houses that were the standard construction at the time however experts contest this account ucsb professor joel michaelsen for instance said  i have never found any outside source to validate tompkins  story and i am highly skeptical of its veracity i don t doubt that strong hot dry downslope winds could kick up lots of dust and produce very high temperatures  but in the 110 f  115 f range at most the 133 f just isn t physically reasonable as it would require the creation of an extremely hot air mass somewhere to the northeast last monday s weather was a very good strong example of the sort of conditions that would produce such a heat wave and our temperatures topped out at least 20 degrees below tompkins  figure stronger winds could have increased the heating a bit but not nearly that much add to all that meteorologically-based skepticism tompkins  well-known tendency to mix liberal doses of fiction into his  histories  and i think you have a strong case for discounting this one meteorologist christopher c burt writing on weather underground says about the alleged incident   there is no record of who made this measurement or exactly where it was made in santa barbara some later sources say it was made on a u.s coastal geo-survey vessel if that is the case then the temperature is not possible since the waters off santa barbara in june are never warmer than about 70f and any wind blowing over the ocean would have its temperature modified by the cool water no matter how hot the air this report is singular and there is physical evidence  burnt crops and dead animals  that something amazing happened here this day but the temperature record is impossible to validate
