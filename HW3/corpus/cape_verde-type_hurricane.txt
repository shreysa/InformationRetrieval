a cape verde hurricane or cabo verde hurricane is an  that originates at low in the deep  from a  that has passed over or near the  islands after exiting the coast of  the average hurricane season has about two cape verde  which are often the largest and most intense storms of the season due to having plenty of warm open ocean over which to develop before encountering land or other factors prompting weakening a good portion of cape verde storms are large some setting records most of the longest-lived  in the atlantic basin are cape verde hurricanes while many move harmlessly out to sea some move across the  and into the  becoming damaging storms for     the  and occasionally even  research projects since the 1970s have been launched to understand the formation of these storms

origin 
prior to the early 1940s the term cape verde hurricane referred to august and early september storms that formed to the east of the surface plotting charts in use at the time cape verde hurricanes typically develop from tropical waves which form in the african  during the  then move into the african  the disturbances move off the western coast of  and become  or  soon after moving off the coast within 10 to 15 degrees latitude or 1,100 kilometres  680mi  to 1,600 kilometres  990mi  of the  islands  this comprises the tropical latitudes east of the  in the years since the phrase s coining increasing detection has allowed meteorologists to determine that cape verde hurricanes have formed as early as july 3   of 2008  or as late as october 2   of 1953  typical tracks 





cape verde  tracks


a cape verde hurricane forms from a tropical depression or tropical wave which passed through or near the cape verde islands and strengthens into a named system  eventually becoming a hurricane at some point  in the mid-atlantic the initial track of a cape verde storm tends to be generally westward from cape verde with a turn to the north at some stage in the track for most storms lasting more than a few days once the  begins approaching the 40th meridian west a cape verde hurricane can take several basic tracks and from there diverge become extra-tropical or dissipate

it can continue to the west and if it is far enough south it will cross the  into the  possibly affecting  to some degree from there it will often continue westward into   or  for example  took this southerly route in 1988 causing severe flooding in  making landfall in  and continuing into the  just as  did in 1971 rarely a storm will

some storms pass unabated into the gulf of mexico  of 2004 began with a very southerly route yet it made landfall far to the north in  somewhere in the middle of these extremes storms such as 1980 s  track toward the coast of  affecting areas from the  to  many of these southerly hurricanes strike  like the  and  of 1988  of 1955 will be remembered as one of the deadliest and strongest storms to strike the yucatn peninsula of mexico

if the storm is further north it may travel past the  and into the  in 1998  took a track of this nature as it continued into  slightly further north and the storm will track through the  and into  in the manner of 1992 s  many of these storms passing through the center of the caribbean will strike the islands of  and  like  and  did both in 1979 some storms on this track will turn to the west once in the gulf and thereby make landfall in texas as the  and  of 2008 did similarly  of 1966 followed a caribbean track that took the storm into the bahamas where it weakened only to turn sharply west and make a final landfall in mexico 






gloria  1985  struck the east coast 

a more northerly storm will often have its track affected by  as these storms pass north of the antilles their tracks begin to curve to the north and to the east of the florida peninsula often sending them away from land a few storms will track northwest making landfall in  or   of 1989 and  of 1996 are typical examples occasionally storms following this track can accelerate to the north and strike  the  and  in 1985 were two such cases 






igor  2010  struck atlantic canada 

when a storm tracks very far north its potential for landfall is much less some of these storms will strike bermuda before re-curving out to sea such as the  and  in 2003 occasionally the storm will track west-northwest to strike the atlantic coast of the u.s such as the  and  of 2003 which struck the mid-atlantic other cape verde storms make landfall in canada such as  in 1995 and hurricanes  and  of 2010 if the storm s track is affected significantly it will often pass near the eastern u.s  and  and curve back out to sea where it becomes extratropical over cooler water an example of such was  in 1996 at the extreme cape verde hurricanes can track so far north as to curve all the way to europe such as  of 1961  of 2000 and  of 2011 all of which affected

sometimes the  is displaced from its normal position which allows storms to recurve quickly by being driven around the east side of an upper trough in the central atlantic generally missing land completely as they dissipate both  and  were affected like this in 2004 in other cases storms are steered north very early in their development near cape verde such as the 1989 storms  and  which both traveled northwest and never threatened land however in extremely rare cases these storms will hit the cape verde islands or the  at a significant intensity two notable examples of this are  which hit cape verde in 2015 and   both of which caused considerable destruction 

because most cape verde hurricanes take a near-westward path that starts in the eastern atlantic they can avoid the two situations that typically end the life of a tropical cyclone  interaction with land and movement over cool water since storms that far out at sea can go over a week without moving over cooler water or near a landmass cape verde hurricanes are some of the longest-lived and farthest-travelling storms  of 1966 the farthest-travelling atlantic hurricane on record was a cape verde hurricane it travelled 6,850miles  11,020km  and lasted a total of 16days  of 1988 and  of 1971 lasted longer both having crossed narrow parts of central america and regaining cyclonic motion in the pacific research 
twenty nations took part in the gate research project in 1974 where  aircraft examined  which spawn cape verde hurricanes in 2006 there was a two-month research project known as namma-06  short for nasa african monsoon multidisciplinary activities  which flew  into seedling disturbances in the eastern atlantic which had the potential to become cape verde hurricanes see also
