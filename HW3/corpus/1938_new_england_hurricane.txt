the 1938 new england hurricane  also referred to as the great new england hurricane and long island express  was one of the deadliest and most destructive  to strike  and  the storm formed near the coast of africa on september9 becoming a category5 hurricane on the  before making landfall as a category3 hurricane on  on september21 it is estimated that the hurricane killed 682 people damaged or destroyed more than 57,000 homes and caused property losses estimated at us 306million  4.7billion in 2017  damaged trees and buildings were still seen in the affected areas as late as 1951 it remains the most powerful and deadliest hurricane in recorded new england history eclipsed in landfall intensity perhaps only by the

the storm was first analyzed by ship data south of the  on september9 over the next ten days it steadily gathered strength and slowly tracked to the west-northwest  it is estimated to have reached category5 intensity by september20 while centered east of the  it then veered northward in response to a deep trough over  sparing the bahamas florida the carolinas and the  at the same time a high pressure system was centered north of  preventing the hurricane from making an eastward turn out to sea thus the hurricane was effectively squeezed to the north between the two weather systems this caused the storm s forward speed to increase substantially late on september20 ultimately reaching 70mph the highest forward velocity ever recorded in the annals of hurricanes this extreme forward motion was in the same general direction as the winds on the eastern side of the storm as it proceeded north  this in turn caused the wind speed to be far higher in areas east of the storm s eye than would be the case with a hurricane of more typical forward speed the storm was centered several hundred miles to the southeast of  during the early hours of september21 and it weakened slightly by 8 30am edt it was centered approximately 100 miles  160km  due east of cape hatteras and its forward speed had increased to well over 50mph this rapid movement did not permit enough time for the storm to weaken over the cooler waters before it reached  the hurricane sped through the virginia tidewater during the 9 00am hour between 12 00pm and 2 00pm the  coastline and new york city caught the western edge at the same time weather conditions began to deteriorate rapidly on long island and along the southern new england coast the hurricane made landfall at  on long island s suffolk county sometime between 2 10pm and 2 40pm as a category3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120mph it made a second landfall as a category3 hurricane somewhere between  and   at around 4 00pm with sustained winds of 115mph the storm s eye moved into western massachusetts by 5 00pm and it reached vermont by 6 00pm both  and  reported calm conditions and partial clearing during passage of the eye which is a rather unusual occurrence for a new england hurricane the hurricane began to lose tropical characteristics as it continued into northern vermont though it was still carrying hurricane-force winds it crossed into  at approximately 10 00pm transitioning into a  the post-tropical remnants dissipated over northern  a few days later forecasting the storm 
in 1938 united states forecasting lagged behind forecasting in europe where new techniques were being used to analyze air masses taking into account the influence of fronts a confidential report was released by the  the parent agency of the  it described the weather bureau s forecasting as  a sorry state of affairs  where forecasters had poor training and systematic planning was not used and where forecasters had to  scrape by  to get information wherever they could the  office of the weather bureau issued a warning on september 19 that a hurricane might hit florida residents and authorities made extensive preparations as they had endured the  three years earlier when the storm turned north the office issued warnings for the carolina coast and transferred authority to the bureau s headquarters in washington at 9 00 am on september 21 the washington office issued northeast storm warnings north of atlantic city and south of  and southeast storm warnings from block island to  the advisory however underestimated the storm s intensity and said that it was farther south than it actually was the office had yet to forward any information about the hurricane to the new york city office at 10 00 am the bureau downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm the 11 30 am advisory mentioned gale-force winds but nothing about a tropical storm or hurricane that day 28 year-old rookie charles pierce was standing in for two veteran meteorologists he concluded that the storm would be squeezed between a  area located to the west and a high-pressure area to the east and that it would be forced to ride up a  into new england a noon meeting was called and pierce presented his conclusion but he was overruled by  celebrated  chief forecaster charles mitchell and his senior staff in boston meteorologist e.b rideout told his  radio listeners  to the skepticism of his peers  that the hurricane would hit new england at 2 00 pm hurricane-force gusts were occurring on long island s south shore and near hurricane-force gusts on the coast of connecticut the washington office issued an advisory saying that the storm was 75 miles east-southeast of atlantic city and would pass over long island and connecticut re-analysis of the storm suggests that the hurricane was farther north  just 50 miles from fire island  and that it was stronger and larger than the advisory said impact

the majority of the storm damage was from  and wind damage was estimated at  308million the equivalent of  5.1billion adjusted for inflation in 2016 dollars making it among the most costly hurricanes to strike the u.s mainland it is estimated that if an identical hurricane had struck in 2005 it would have caused  39.2billion in damage due to changes in population and infrastructure approximately 600 people died in the storm in new england most in  and up to 100 people elsewhere in the path of the storm an additional 708 people were reported injured in total 4,500 cottages farms and other homes were reported destroyed and 25,000 homes were damaged other damages included 26,000 automobiles destroyed and 20,000 electrical poles toppled the hurricane also devastated the forests of the northeast knocking down an estimated two billion trees in new york and new england freshwater flooding was minimal however as the quick passage of the storm decreased local rainfall totals with only a few small areas receiving over 10 inches  250 mm  over 35 of new england s total forest area was affected in all over 2.7billion board feet of trees fell because of the storm although 1.6billion board feet of the trees were salvaged the northeastern timber salvage administration  netsa  was established to deal with the extreme fire hazard that the fallen timber had created in many locations roads from the fallen tree removal were visible decades later and some became trails still used today the  from new haven to providence was particularly hard hit as countless bridges along the  were destroyed or flooded severing rail connections to badly affected cities such as  due to the lack of technology back in 1938 long island residents were not warned of the hurricane s arrival leaving no time to prepare or evacuate long island was struck first before new england and quebec earning the storm the nickname the  long island express  the winds reached up to 150mph with waves surging to around 2535 feet high  and  both owned large forests managed by their forestry departments but both forests were wiped out by the hurricane however yale had a backup forest at great mountain in northwestern connecticut which was spared from the totality of the damages and they were able to keep their forestry program running which maintains operation today harvard s program however was reduced as a result new jersey 
the western side of the hurricane caused sustained tropical storm-force winds high waves and storm surge along much of the new jersey coast the surge destroyed much of the boardwalk in  and the bridge collapsed between atlantic city and  stranding at least 2,000 additionally the surge inundated several coastal communities   was under 3 feet  0.91m  of water at the height of the storm and the boardwalk was destroyed in  and dozens of cottages washed into the ocean crops sustained wind damage the maximum recorded wind gust was 70mph at  new york city and western long island 
the metropolitan area escaped the worst of the wind and storm surge because it was hit by the storm s weaker western side winds were recorded at 60mph at   recorded sustained winds of 70mph with gusts to 80mph and a gust of 90mph was recorded 500feet above ground at the  winds were estimated at 120mph on top of the  the highest winds were from the north to northwest on the back side of the storm the storm surge was 8 feet at the battery and the mean low water storm tide was 16 feet at  in new york harbor the waters rose 7feet in a half-hour in new york city and long island schools were dismissed early extensive street flooding occurred because debris blocked drains the  flowed three blocks and flooded a   con ed  plant at 133rd street causing power to fail in manhattan north of 59th street and in the bronx for several minutes to a few hours railroad and ferry services were suspended for a time the  boat knickerbocker got stuck in the terminal with 200 passengers aboard bridges and tunnels into manhattan were closed until the following afternoon 95 of  lost power where floods brought traffic to a halt in  almost 400 boats were ripped from their moorings and smashed or sunk with more than 100 washing up on the beach by the  yacht club similar scenes occurred in other locations on the north shore the  estate in  was heavily damaged the wife of new york city mayor  was forced to wait out the storm on the second floor of their  cottage  army airfield was buffeted by winds of nearly 100mph and was under knee-deep water in  residents of 50 homes needed to be rescued by rowboat when heavy rain the previous few days combined with the rain from the hurricane to overflow a pond eastern long island 
eastern long island experienced the worst of the storm the dune road area of  was obliterated resulting in 29 deaths there were 21 other deaths through the rest of the east end of long island the storm surge temporarily turned  into an island as it flooded across the south fork at  and obliterated the tracks of the  long island was hit hard being exposed to the storm due to its shorelines the estimated storm tide was 15 feet in this region a mean low water storm tide of 8 feet was recorded at  about 50 people perished in the storm s wake all the shore lines were very vulnerable to the high winds and flooding and anyone near the shores was directly in harm s way ten new inlets were created on eastern long island the surge rearranged the sand at the cedar point lighthouse so that the island became connected to what is now  the surging water created the  by carving out a large section of barrier island separating shinnecock bay from the atlantic the storm toppled the landmark steeple of the  which was the tallest building in  the steeple has not been rebuilt  suffered substantial damage the storm blew down the movie theater on front street in greenport on the north fork of long island the fishing industry was destroyed as was half of the apple crop rhode island

the eye of the storm followed the connecticut river north into  where the winds and flooding killed 99 people in springfield the river rose six to 10 feet  3m  above flood stage causing significant damage up to six inches  152mm  of rain fell across western massachusetts which combined with over four inches  102mm  that had fallen a few days earlier to produce widespread flooding flash flooding on the chicopee river washed away the chicopee falls bridge while the connecticut river flooded most of the willimansett section residents of  were stranded for days and relied on air-dropped food and medicine after the flood receded the town s main street was a chasm in which sewer pipes could be seen to the east the surge left  and  under eight feet of water two-thirds of the boats sank in new bedford harbor several homes washed away on atlantic boulevard in  whose foundations can still be found on the beach today the  registered sustained winds of 121mph  195km h  and a peak gust of 186mph  299km h  which is the strongest hurricane-related surface wind gust ever recorded in the united states a 50-foot wave the tallest of the storm was recorded at  






vermont 
the storm entered  as a category 1 hurricane at approximately 6 00pm edt reaching northern vermont  and  around 8 00pm hurricane-force winds caused extensive damage to trees buildings and power lines over 2,000 miles  3,200km  of public roads were blocked and it took months for crews to reopen some of the roads in  120 miles  190km  from the nearest coast salt spray was seen on windows a train was derailed in  the storm killed five people in vermont maple and sugar groves were damaged the 1938 hurricane has been the only tropical cyclone to make a direct hit on vermont in its recorded history  it remains the only one known to have struck vermont as a hurricane new hampshire

in  buildings and trees were damaged and power outages occurred storm surge was minimal and winds remained below hurricane strength the storm did not claim any lives in maine maryland and delaware 
the western periphery of the hurricane brought heavy rain and gusty winds to delaware and southeastern maryland damage if any is believed to have been minimal quebec 
as the hurricane was transitioning into an  it tracked into southern quebec by the time the system initially crossed into canada it continued to produce heavy rain and very strong winds but interaction with land had taken its toll nevertheless the hurricane managed to blow down numerous trees throughout the region otherwise damage was generally minimal see also
