tropical cyclone 
a  is classified as making landfall when the center of the storm moves across the coast  in strong tropical cyclones this is when the  moves over land this is where most of the damage occurs within a mature tropical cyclone such as a typhoon or hurricane as most of the damaging aspects of these systems are concentrated near the  such effects include the peaking of the  the core of strong winds coming ashore and heavy flooding rains these coupled with high surf can cause major beach  in low-lying areas the storm surge can stay inland for a long time and mix with chemicals already in the area to create a toxic mess  when a tropical cyclone makes landfall the eye closes in upon itself due to the weakening process which causes surf to decrease  will naturally decrease as the cyclone moves inland due to frictional differences between water and land with the free atmosphere landfall is distinct from a direct hit a direct hit is where the core of high winds  or eyewall  comes onshore but the center of the storm may stay offshore the effects of this are quite similar to a landfall as this term is used when the radius of maximum wind within a tropical cyclone moves ashore these effects are high surf heavy rains that may cause flooding water buildup along the coast with minor storm surge coastal beach erosion high winds and possibly severe thunderstorms with tornadoes around the periphery tornado or waterspout 
when a   makes landfall it is reclassified as a tornado which can subsequently cause damage to areas inland of the coast when a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it usually dissipates quickly due to friction and a reduction in the amount of warm air supplied to the funnel see also
