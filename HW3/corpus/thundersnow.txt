thundersnow formation with an 


thundersnow also known as a winter thunderstorm or a thundersnowstorm is an unusual kind of  with  falling as the primary  instead of  it typically falls in regions of strong upward motion within the cold sector of an  thermodynamically it is not different from any other type of thunderstorm but the top of the  is usually quite low in addition to snow  or  may fall

occurrence 
thundersnow while relatively rare anywhere is more common with  in the  area of the united states and canada the  united states and the  thundersnow also occurs in   sometimes several times per winter season  also sees thundersnow more often than average with these storms typically occurring in april or may in the united states march is the peak month of formation  on average only 6.4 events are reported per year the british isles and other parts of northwestern europe occasionally report thunder and lightning during sleet or  usually wet  snow showers during winter and spring it is also common around  and the  and even around  low pressure events in the eastern  that originate from polar origin cause copious thundersnow occurrences during winter storms especially over the elevated provinces of  and  including  and  when such storms happen at areas intended for skiing the mountains are often evacuated for safety acoustic effects 
one unique aspect of thundersnow is that the suspended and deposited snowfall act as an  of the sound of thunder the thunder from a typical thunderstorm can be heard many miles away while the thunder from thundersnow can usually only be heard within a 23-mile  3.24.8km  radius from the lightning there are usually three causes of thundersnow 

a normal  on the leading edge of a  or  that can either form in a winter environment or that runs into cool air and where the precipitation takes the form of snow
a heavy  snowstorm that sustains strong vertical mixing which allows for favorable conditions for  and  to occur
a  or ocean effect thunderstorm which is produced by cold air passing over relatively warm water  this effect commonly produces  over the 

lake effect precipitation

lake effect thundersnow occurs after a cold front or  aloft passes over a body of water this steepens the thermal  between the lake temperature and the temperatures aloft a difference in temperature of 25c  45f  or more between the lake temperature and the temperature at about 1,500m  4,900ft   the 850 hpa level  usually marks the onset of thundersnow if surface temperatures are expected to be below freezing however several factors including other geographical elements affect the development of thundersnow the primary factor is convective depth this is the vertical depth in the  that a parcel of air will rise from the ground before it reaches the equilibrium  eql  level and stops rising a minimum depth of 1,500m  4,900ft  is necessary and an average depth of 3,000m  9,800ft  or more is generally accepted as sufficient  is also a significant factor linear snow squall bands produce more thundersnow than clustered bands  thus a directional wind shear with a change of less than 12c  54f  between the ground and 2,000m  6,600ft  in height must be in place however any change in direction greater than 12c  54f  through that layer will tear the snow squall apart a bare minimum  of 50km h  31mph  is required so that the air passing over the lake or ocean water will become sufficiently saturated with moisture and will acquire thermal energy from the water the last component is the echo top or storm top temperature this must be at least 30c  22f  it is generally accepted that at this temperature there is no longer any  water vapor present in a cloud but just ice crystals suspended in the air this allows for the interaction of the ice cloud and graupel pellets within the storm to generate a charge resulting in lightning and thunder synoptic forcing 
synoptic snow storms tend to be large and complex with many possible factors affecting the development of thundersnow the best location in a storm to find thundersnow is typically in its    in the  based on observations in the   within what is known as the  comma head  of a mature  thundersnow can also be located underneath the  a trough of warm air aloft which shows up in a  as an inverted trough extending backward into the cold sector from the main cyclone in extreme cases thunderstorms along the cold front are transported towards the center of the low pressure system and will have their precipitation change to snow or ice once the cold front becomes a portion of the occluded front the   and  are examples of such blizzards featuring thundersnow upslope flow 
similar to the lake effect regime thundersnow is usually witnessed in terrain in the cold sector of an  when a shortwave aloft moves into the region the shortwave will steepen the local lapse rates allowing for a greater possibility of both heavy snow at elevations where it is near or below freezing and occasionally thundersnow hazards 
thundersnow produces heavy snowfall rates in the range of 5 to 10cm  2 to 4in  per hour snowfall of this intensity may  even during light wind conditions however thundersnow is often a part of a severe  or  winds of above   are frequent with thundersnow as a result visibilities in thundersnow are frequently under 400m  14mi  additionally such wind creates extreme  and may result in  finally there is a greater likelihood that thundersnow lightning will have a   which has greater destructive potential than negatively charged  typical  lightning see also
