tropical cyclone forecasting is the science of forecasting where a  s center and its effects are expected to be at some point in the future there are several elements to tropical cyclone forecasting  track forecasting intensity forecasting rainfall forecasting storm surge tornado and seasonal forecasting while skill is increasing in regard to track forecasting intensity forecasting skill remains nearly unchanged over the past several years seasonal forecasting began in the 1980s in the atlantic basin and has spread into other basins in the years since

history
the methods through which tropical cyclones are forecast have changed with the passage of time the first known forecasts in the western hemisphere were made by lt col william reed of the  at barbados in 1847 reed mostly utilized  measurements as the basis of his forecasts benito vines introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in  during the 1870s before the early 1900s though most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations which were then relayed to forecast centers via  it wasnt until the advent of  in the early twentieth century that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters the 1930s saw the usage of  in tropical cyclone forecasting the next decade saw the advent of aircraft-based reconnaissance by the military starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943 and the establishment of the  in 1944 in the 1950s coastal  began to be used in the united states and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the  began in 1954 the launch of the first weather satellite tiros-i in 1960 introduced new forecasting techniques that remain important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present in the 1970s buoys were introduced to improve the resolution of surface measurements which until that point were not available at all over sea surfaces long term 
in the late 1970s  noticed a trend of low hurricane activity in the  during  years he was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research he found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity such as connecting wet periods over the african  to an increase in   along the  however his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single factor as a primary influence utilizing his findings gray developed an objective statistical forecast for seasonal hurricane activity  he predicted only the number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes foregoing specifics on tracks and potential landfalls due to the aforementioned inconsistencies gray issued his first seasonal forecast ahead of the 1984 season which used the statistical relationships between tropical cyclone activity the   enso    qbo  and caribbean basin sea-level pressures the endeavor proved modestly successful he subsequently issued forecasts ahead of the start of the atlantic hurricane season in may and before the peak of the season in august students and colleagues joined his forecast team in the following years including  paul w mielke jr and kenneth j berry track

the  determines 70 to 90 percent of a tropical cyclone s motion the deep-layer mean flow is considered to be the best tool in determining track direction and speed if storms are significantly sheared use of a lower-level wind is a better predictor knowledge of the beta effect can be used to steer a tropical cyclone since it leads to a more northwest heading for tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere it is also best to smooth out short term wobbles of the storm center in order to determine a more accurate trajectory because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high and low-pressure areas and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones and a wealth of data from earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades an accurate track forecast is important because if the track forecast is incorrect forecasts for intensity rainfall storm surge and tornado threat will also be incorrect 1-2-3 rule

the 1-2-3 rule  mariner s 1-2-3 rule or danger area  is a guideline commonly taught to  for severe   specifically  and   tracking and prediction it refers to the rounded long-term  forecast errors of 100-200-300  at 24-48-72hours respectively these numbers were close to the 10-year average for the 19821991 time frame however these errors have decreased to near 50-100-150 as nhc forecasters become more accurate the  danger area  to be avoided is constructed by expanding the forecast path by a radius equal to the respective hundreds of miles plus the forecast wind radii  size of the storm at those hours  intensity

forecasters say they are less skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones than cyclone track they attribute the lack of improvement in intensity forecasting to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development an accurate track forecast is essential to creating accurate intensity forecasts particularly in an area with large islands such as the western north pacific and the caribbean sea as proximity to land is an inhibiting factor to developing tropical cyclones a strong hurricane typhoon cyclone can weaken if an outer eye wall forms  typically around 80160kilometers  50100miles  from the center of the storm  choking off the convection within the inner eye wall such weakening is called an  and is usually temporary maximum potential intensity 
dr  created a  around 1988 called the maximum potential intensity or mpi to compute the upper limit of tropical cyclone intensity based on sea surface temperature and atmospheric profiles from the  maps created from this equation show values of the maximum achievable intensity due to the  of the atmosphere at the time of the last model run  either 0000 or 1200   however mpi does not take vertical  into account mpi is computed using the following formula 

where  is the maximum potential velocity in meters per second   is the sea surface temperature underneath the center of the tropical cyclone  is a reference temperature  30c  and   and  are curve-fit constants when   and  the graph generated by this function corresponds to the 99th percentile of empirical tropical cyclone intensity data rainfall

tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting is important since between 19702004 inland flooding from tropical cyclones caused a majority of the fatalities from tropical cyclones in the  while  is common to tropical cyclones near a landmass there are a few factors which lead to excessive rainfall from tropical cyclones slow motion as was seen during  and  can lead to high amounts the presence of topography near the coast as is the case across much of   the  much of     and  acts to magnify amounts due to upslope flow into the mountains strong upper level forcing from a trough moving through the westerlies as was the case during  can lead to high amounts even from systems moving at an average forward motion a combination of two of these factors could be especially crippling as was seen during  in  therefore an accurate track forecast is essential in order to produce an accurate tropical cyclone rainfall forecast operational methods

historically tropical cyclone tracking charts were used to include the past track and prepare future forecasts at regional specialized meteorological centers and tropical cyclone warning centers the need for a more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent to operational weather forecasters by the mid-1980s at that time the  was using paper maps acetate grease pencils and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones the automated tropical cyclone forecasting system  atcf  software was developed by the  for the   jtwc  beginning in 1986 and used since 1988 during 1990 the system was adapted by the   nhc  for use at the nhc  and the  this provided the nhc with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25 or 1 hour atcf was originally developed for use within  before later being adapted to unix and linux storm surge
