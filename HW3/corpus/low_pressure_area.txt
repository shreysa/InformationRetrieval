a clockwise spinning low pressure area or cyclone off southern australia the center of the spiral-shaped cloud system is also the center of a low and usually is where the pressure is lowest 





this low-pressure system over  spins counter-clockwise due to balance between the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force

cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of  circulations or low-pressure areas within the  cyclogenesis is the opposite of  and has an anticyclonic  high-pressure system  equivalent which deals with the formation of  cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes all of which result in the development of some sort of  meteorologists use the term  cyclone  where circular pressure systems flow in the direction of the earth s rotation which normally coincides with areas of low pressure the largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the  warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones  and  lie within the smaller  subtropical cyclones are of intermediate size cyclogenesis can occur at various scales from the microscale to the synoptic scale larger-scale troughs also called rossby waves are synoptic in scale shortwave troughs embedded within the flow around larger scale troughs are smaller in scale or mesoscale in nature both rossby waves and shortwaves embedded within the flow around rossby waves migrate equatorward of the  located in both the northern and southern hemispheres all share one important aspect that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air which lowers surface pressure extratropical cyclones form as waves along  due to a passing by shortwave aloft or upper level jet streak  before occluding later in their life cycle as cold-core cyclones polar lows are small-scale short-lived atmospheric low-pressure systems that occur over the ocean areas poleward of the main  in both the northern and southern hemispheres they are part of the larger class of  weather-systems polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high-latitude operations such as shipping and gas and oil-platforms they are vigorous systems that have near-surface winds of at least 17 metres per second  38mph
