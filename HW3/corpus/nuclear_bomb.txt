there are two basic types of nuclear weapons  those that derive the majority of their energy from nuclear fission reactions alone and those that use fission reactions to begin  reactions that produce a large amount of the total energy output fission weapons




the two basic  weapon designs


all existing nuclear weapons derive some of their explosive energy from nuclear fission reactions weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are commonly referred to as atomic bombs or atom bombs  abbreviated as a-bombs  this has long been noted as something of a  as their energy comes from the nucleus of the atom just as it does with fusion weapons in fission weapons a mass of    or   is forced into allowing an  of either by shooting one piece of sub-critical material into another  the  gun  method  or by compressing using  a sub-critical sphere of material using  to many times its original density  the  implosion  method  the latter approach is considered more sophisticated than the former and only the latter approach can be used if the fissile material is plutonium a major challenge in all nuclear weapon designs is to ensure that a significant fraction of the fuel is consumed before the weapon destroys itself the amount of energy released by fission bombs can range from the equivalent of just under a ton to upwards of 500,000 tons  500   of   4.2 to 2.1108gj  all fission reactions generate  the remains of the split atomic nuclei many fission products are either highly radioactive  but short-lived  or moderately radioactive  but long-lived  and as such they are a serious form of  if not fully contained fission products are the principal radioactive component of  the most commonly used fissile materials for nuclear weapons applications have been  and  less commonly used has been   and some isotopes of  may be usable for nuclear explosives as well but it is not clear that this has ever been implemented and their plausible use in nuclear weapons is a matter of dispute fusion weapons

the basics of the  for a hydrogen bomb  a fission bomb uses radiation to compress and heat a separate section of fusion fuel 

the other basic type of nuclear weapon produces a large proportion of its energy in nuclear fusion reactions such fusion weapons are generally referred to as thermonuclear weapons or more colloquially as hydrogen bombs  abbreviated as h-bombs  as they rely on fusion reactions between isotopes of    and   all such weapons derive a significant portion of their energy from fission reactions used to  trigger  fusion reactions and fusion reactions can themselves trigger additional fission reactions only six countriesunited states russia united kingdom china france and indiahave conducted thermonuclear weapon tests  whether india has detonated a  true  multi-staged  is controversial   claims to have tested a fusion weapon as of january 2016 though this claim is disputed thermonuclear weapons are considered much more difficult to successfully design and execute than primitive fission weapons almost all of the nuclear weapons deployed today use the thermonuclear design because it is more efficient 
thermonuclear bombs work by using the energy of a fission bomb to compress and heat fusion fuel in the  which accounts for all multi-megaton yield hydrogen bombs this is accomplished by placing a fission bomb and fusion fuel    or   in proximity within a special radiation-reflecting container when the fission bomb is detonated  and  emitted first compress the fusion fuel then heat it to thermonuclear temperatures the ensuing fusion reaction creates enormous numbers of high-speed  which can then induce fission in materials not normally prone to it such as  each of these components is known as a  stage  with the fission bomb as the  primary  and the fusion capsule as the  secondary  in large megaton-range hydrogen bombs about half of the yield comes from the final fissioning of depleted uranium virtually all thermonuclear weapons deployed today use the  two-stage  design described above but it is possible to add additional fusion stageseach stage igniting a larger amount of fusion fuel in the next stage this technique can be used to construct thermonuclear weapons of arbitrarily large yield in contrast to fission bombs which are limited in their explosive force the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated the  of the ussr which released an energy equivalent of over 50 megatons of tnt  210pj  was a three-stage weapon most thermonuclear weapons are considerably smaller than this due to practical constraints from missile warhead space and weight requirements 



 often referred to as the  father of the hydrogen bomb 


fusion reactions do not create fission products and thus contribute far less to the creation of nuclear fallout than fission reactions but because all thermonuclear weapons contain at least one fission stage and many high-yield thermonuclear devices have a final fission stage thermonuclear weapons can generate at least as much nuclear fallout as fission-only weapons other types

there are other types of nuclear weapons as well for example a  is a fission bomb that increases its explosive yield through a small amount of fusion reactions but it is not a fusion bomb in the boosted bomb the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions serve primarily to increase the efficiency of the fission bomb there are two types of boosted fission bomb  internally boosted in which a deuterium-tritium mixture is injected into the bomb core and externally boosted in which concentric shells of lithium-deuteride and depleted uranium are layered on the outside of the fission bomb core some nuclear weapons are designed for special purposes  a  is a thermonuclear weapon that yields a relatively small explosion but a relatively large amount of neutron   such a device could theoretically be used to cause massive casualties while leaving infrastructure mostly intact and creating a minimal amount of fallout the detonation of any nuclear weapon is accompanied by a blast of  surrounding a nuclear weapon with suitable materials  such as  or   creates a weapon known as a  this device can produce exceptionally large quantities of long-lived  it has been conjectured that such a device could serve as a  doomsday weapon  because such a large quantity of radioactivities with half-lives of decades lifted into the stratosphere where winds would distribute it around the globe would make all life on the planet extinct in connection with the  research into the  was conducted under the dod program  but this did not result in a working weapon the concept involves the tapping of the energy of an exploding nuclear bomb to power a single-shot laser which is directed at a distant target during the  high-altitude nuclear test in 1962 an unexpected effect was produced which is called a  this is an intense flash of electromagnetic energy produced by a rain of high energy electrons which in turn are produced by a nuclear bomb s gamma rays this flash of energy can permanently destroy or disrupt electronic equipment if insufficiently shielded it has been proposed to use this effect to disable an enemy s military and civilian infrastructure as an adjunct to other nuclear or conventional military operations against that enemy because the effect is produced by high altitude nuclear detonations it can produce damage to electronics over a wide even continental geographical area research has been done into the possibility of   nuclear weapons that consist of fusion reactions without requiring a fission bomb to initiate them such a device might provide a simpler path to thermonuclear weapons than one that required development of fission weapons first and pure fusion weapons would create significantly less nuclear fallout than other thermonuclear weapons because they would not disperse fission products in 1998 the  divulged that the united states had made a substantial investment  in the past to develop pure fusion weapons but that  the u.s does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon  and that  no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the doe investment   which consists of  resembling ordinary  particles in most of their properties but having opposite  has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons a major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities and there is no evidence that it is feasible beyond the military domain however the u.s air force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the  and began considering its possible use in weapons not just as a trigger but as the explosive itself a fourth generation nuclear weapon design is related to and relies upon the same principle as  most variation in  is for the purpose of achieving  and in manipulating design elements to attempt to minimize weapon size weapons delivery

the system used to  a nuclear weapon to its target is an important factor affecting both  and  the design development and maintenance of delivery systems are among the most expensive parts of a nuclear weapons program  they account for example for 57 of the financial resources spent by the united states on nuclear weapons projects since 1940 the simplest method for delivering a nuclear weapon is a  dropped from   this was the method used by the united states against japan this method places few restrictions on the size of the weapon it does however limit attack range response time to an impending attack and the number of weapons that a country can field at the same time with miniaturization nuclear bombs can be delivered by both  and tactical  this method is the primary means of nuclear weapons delivery  the majority of u.s nuclear warheads for example are free-fall gravity bombs namely the

nuclear warfare strategy is a set of policies that deal with preventing or fighting a nuclear war the policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of  the goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability  the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own  and potentially to strive for  status  the ability to destroy an enemy s nuclear forces before they could retaliate  during the cold war policy and military theorists considered the sorts of policies that might prevent a nuclear attack and they developed  models that could lead to stable  conditions 



the now decommissioned united states   was an  developed to replace the  in the late 1980s each missile like the  russian  could contain up to ten nuclear warheads  shown in red  each of which could be aimed at a different target a factor in the development of  was to make complete  difficult for an enemy country 

different forms of   see above  allow for different types of nuclear strategies the goals of any strategy are generally to make it difficult for an enemy to launch a pre-emptive strike against the weapon system and difficult to defend against the delivery of the weapon during a potential conflict this can mean keeping weapon locations hidden such as deploying them on  or land mobile  whose locations are difficult to track or it can mean protecting weapons by burying them in hardened  bunkers other components of nuclear strategies included using missile defenses to destroy the missiles before they land or implementing  measures using early-warning systems to evacuate citizens to safe areas before an attack weapons designed to threaten large populations or to deter attacks are known as  nuclear weapons for use on a  in military situations are called  critics of nuclear war strategy often suggest that a nuclear war between two nations would result in mutual annihilation from this point of view the significance of nuclear weapons is to deter war because any nuclear war would escalate out of mutual distrust and fear resulting in  this threat of national if not global destruction has been a strong motivation for anti-nuclear weapons activism critics from the peace movement and within the military establishment  have questioned the usefulness of such weapons in the current military climate according to an  issued by the  in 1996 the use of  or threat of use of  such weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict but the court did not reach an opinion as to whether or not the threat or use would be lawful in specific extreme circumstances such as if the survival of the state were at stake another  position is that  can be desirable in this case it is argued that unlike conventional weapons nuclear weapons deter all-out war between states and they succeeded in doing this during the  between the u.s and the  in the late 1950s and early 1960s gen  of france an adviser to  argued in books like the balance of terror  strategy for the nuclear age  1961  that mere possession of a nuclear arsenal was enough to ensure deterrence and thus concluded that the spread of nuclear weapons could increase  some prominent  scholars such as  and  have argued along the lines of gallois that some forms of nuclear proliferation would decrease the likelihood of  especially in troubled regions of the world where there exists a single nuclear-weapon state aside from the public opinion that opposes proliferation in any form there are two schools of thought on the matter  those like mearsheimer who favored selective proliferation and waltz who was somewhat more non interest in proliferation and the  that it generates continues to this day with ongoing debate about indigenous japanese and  nuclear deterrent against  the threat of potentially suicidal terrorists possessing nuclear weapons  a form of   complicates the decision process the prospect of  might not deter an enemy who expects to die in the confrontation further if the initial act is from a stateless  instead of a sovereign nation there might not be a nation or specific target to retaliate against it has been argued especially after the  that this complication calls for a new nuclear strategy one that is distinct from that which gave relative stability during the cold war since 1996 the united states has had a policy of allowing the targeting of its nuclear weapons at terrorists armed with   argues that although traditional deterrence is not an effective approach toward terrorist groups bent on causing a nuclear catastrophe gallucci believes that  the united states should instead consider a policy of expanded deterrence which focuses not solely on the would-be nuclear terrorists but on those states that may deliberately transfer or inadvertently lead nuclear weapons and materials to them by threatening retaliation against those states the united states may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent   makes a similar case arguing that the key to expanded deterrence is coming up with ways of tracing nuclear material to the country that forged the fissile material  after a nuclear bomb detonates  cops would collect debris samples and send them to a laboratory for radiological analysis by identifying unique attributes of the fissile material including its impurities and contaminants one could trace the path back to its origin  the process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints  the goal would be twofold  first to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their weapons  second to give leaders every incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials

nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world in which nuclear weapons are eliminated beginning with the 1963  and continuing through the 1996  there have been many treaties to limit or reduce nuclear weapons testing and stockpiles the 1968  has as one of its explicit conditions that all signatories must  pursue negotiations in good faith  towards the long-term goal of  complete disarmament  the nuclear weapon states have largely treated that aspect of the agreement as  decorative  and without force only one countrysouth africahas ever fully renounced nuclear weapons they had independently developed the former soviet republics of   and  returned soviet nuclear arms stationed in their countries to russia after the  proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of nuclear war especially accidentally critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine the present  and deterrence and would lead to increased global instability various american elder statesmen who were in office during the  period have been advocating the elimination of nuclear weapons these officials include    and  in january 2010  stated that  no issue carries more importance to the long-term health and security of humanity than the effort to reduce and perhaps one day rid the world of nuclear weapons  



 workers use equipment provided by the u.s  to dismantle a soviet-era missile silo after the end of the cold war ukraine and the other non-russian post-soviet republics relinquished soviet nuclear stockpiles to russia
