in 1916 98 of all commercial intercity travelers in the united states moved by rail  the remaining 2 moved by  passenger traffic on the railroads totaled 42 billion  passenger trains were owned and operated by the same privately owned companies that operated freight trains thereafter patronage declined in the face of competition from   and the  new  diesel-powered trains such as the  were popular with the traveling public but could not reverse the trend by 1940 railroads held just 67 percent of commercial passenger-miles in the united states in real terms passenger-miles had fallen by 40 since 1916 from 42 billion to 25 billion traffic surged during  aided by troop movements and  railroad s market share surged to 74 in 1945 with a massive 94 billion passenger-miles after the war railroads rejuvenated their overworked and neglected passenger fleets with fast and luxurious streamliners these new trains brought only brief relief to the overall decline even as postwar travel exploded passenger travel s percentage of the overall market share fell to 46 by 1950 and 32 by 1957 the railroads had lost money on passenger service since the  but deficits reached  723 million in 1957 for many railroads these losses threatened their financial viability the causes of this decline were many and debated the  and  both funded by the government competed directly with the railroads who paid for their own infrastructure  rate regulation limited the railroad s ability to turn a profit railroads also faced antiquated work rules and inflexible relationships with trade unions to take one example workers continued to receive a day s pay for 100-to-150-mile  160 to 240km  work days streamliners covered that in two hours matters approached a crisis in the 1960s passenger service route-miles fell from 107,000 miles  172,000km  in 1958 to 49,000 miles  79,000km  in 1970 the last full year of private operation the diversion of most  mail from passenger trains to trucks airplanes and freight trains in late 1967 deprived those trains of badly-needed revenue in direct response the  filed to discontinue 33 of its remaining 39 trains ending almost all passenger service on one of the largest railroads in the country the equipment the railroads had ordered after world war ii was now twenty years old worn out and in need of replacement formation

as passenger service declined various proposals were brought forward to rescue it the 1961 doyle report proposed that the private railroads pool their services into a single body similar proposals were made in 1965 and 1968 but failed to attract support the federal government passed the  to fund pilot programs in the  but this did nothing to address passenger deficits in late 1969 multiple proposals emerged in congress including equipment subsidies route subsidies and lastly a  quasi-public corporation  to take over the operation of intercity passenger trains matters were brought to a head on march 5 1970 when the  the largest railroad in the  and teetering on bankruptcy filed to discontinue 34 of its passenger trains in october 1970 congress passed and president  signed into law the rail passenger service act proponents of the bill led by the   narp  sought government funding to ensure the continuation of passenger trains they conceived the national railroad passenger corporation  nrpc  a private entity that would receive taxpayer funding and assume operation of intercity passenger trains the original working  for nrpc was railpax but shortly before the company started operating it was changed to amtrak there were several key provisions 

any railroad operating intercity passenger service could contract with the nrpc thereby joining the national system participating railroads bought into the nrpc using a formula based on their recent intercity passenger losses the purchase price could be satisfied either by cash or rolling stock  in exchange the railroads received nrpc common stock any participating railroad was freed of the obligation to operate intercity passenger service after may 1 1971 except for those services chosen by the   dot  as part of a  basic system  of service and paid for by nrpc using its federal funds railroads that chose not to join the nrpc system were required to continue operating their existing passenger service until 1975 and thenceforth had to pursue the customary icc approval process for any discontinuance or alteration to the service 
of the 26 railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970 only six declined to join amtrak nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived the nixon administration and many washington insiders viewed the nrpc as a politically expedient way for the president and congress to give passenger trains a  last hurrah  as demanded by the public they expected amtrak to quietly disappear as public interest waned after  magazine exposed the manufactured mismanagement in 1974  chairman of the  remarked that the story was undermining the scheme to dismantle amtrak proponents also hoped that government intervention would be brief but their view was that amtrak would soon support itself neither view has proved correct popular support has allowed amtrak to continue in operation longer than critics imagined while financial results have made a return to private operation infeasible

amtrak inherited problems with train stations most notably  and redundant facilities resulting from competing companies that served the same areas on the day it started amtrak was given the responsibility of rerouting passenger trains from the seven train terminals in chicago        and   into just one union station in  amtrak had to pay to maintain both  and  because of the lack of track connections to bring trains from upstate new york into penn station a problem not rectified until the building of the  in 1991  amtrak would abandon numerous large stations whose upkeep could no longer be justified on the other hand the creation of the los angelesseattle  from three formerly separate trains was an immediate success

amtrak s early years are often called the rainbow era which refers to the ad hoc arrangement of the rolling stock and locomotives from a pool of equipment acquired by amtrak at its formation that consisted of a large mix of paint schemes from their former owners this rolling stock which for the most part still bore the pre-amtrak colors and logos formed the multi-colored consists of early amtrak trains by mid-1971 amtrak began purchasing some of the equipment it had leased including 286 second-hand locomotives  of the  e and f types  30  electric locomotives and 1,290 passenger cars and continued leasing even more motive power by 1975 the official amtrak color scheme was painted on most amtrak equipment and newly purchased locomotives and rolling stock began appearing amtrak soon had the opportunity to acquire rights-of-way following the bankruptcy of several northeastern railroads in the early 1970s including penn central which owned and operated the northeast corridor  nec  congress passed the  of 1976 a large part of the legislation was directed to the creation of  but the law also enabled the transfer of the portions of the nec not already owned by state authorities to amtrak amtrak acquired the majority of the nec on april 1 1976  the portion in massachusetts is owned by the commonwealth and managed by amtrak the route from new haven to new rochelle is owned by the  and the  as the   this main line became amtrak s  jewel  asset and helped the railroad generate revenue while the nec ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming as a result amtrak s federal subsidy was increased dramatically in subsequent years other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to amtrak 
in its first decade amtrak fell far short of financial independence which continues today but it did find modest success rebuilding trade outside factors discouraged competing transport such as fuel shortages which increased costs of automobile and airline travel and strikes which disrupted airline operations investments in amtrak s track equipment and information also made amtrak more relevant to america s transportation needs amtrak s ridership increased from 16.6million in 1972 to 21 million in 1981 1980s and 1990s

ridership increased during the first decade of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the nec and rises in automobile fuel costs the inauguration of the  acela express in late 2000 generated considerable publicity and led to major ridership gains however through the late 1990s and very early 21st century amtrak could not add sufficient express freight revenue or cut sufficient other expenditures to break even by 2002 it was clear that amtrak could not achieve self-sufficiency but congress continued to authorize funding and released amtrak from the requirement in early 2002  replaced warrington as president in a departure from his predecessors  promises to make amtrak self-sufficient in the short term gunn argued that no form of passenger transportation in the united states is self-sufficient as the economy is currently structured highways airports and air traffic control all require large government expenditures to build and operate coming from the  and  paid for by user fees highway fuel and road taxes and in the case of the general fund from general taxation gunn dropped most freight express business and worked to eliminate deferred maintenance a plan by the bush administration  to privatize parts of the national passenger rail system and spin off other parts to partial state ownership  provoked disagreement within amtrak s board of directors late in 2005 gunn was fired gunn s replacement   200608  was committed to operating a national rail network and like gunn opposed the notion of putting the northeast corridor under separate ownership he said that shedding the system s long-distance routes would amount to selling national assets that are on par with national parks and that amtrak s abandonment of these routes would be irreversible in late 2006 amtrak unsuccessfully sought annual congressional funding of  1billion for ten years in early 2007 amtrak employed 20,000 people in 46 states and served 25 million passengers a year its highest amount since its founding in 1970  noted a key problem   the rail system chronically operates in the red a pattern has emerged  congress overrides cutbacks demanded by the white house and appropriates enough funds to keep amtrak from plunging into insolvency but amtrak advocates say that is not enough to fix the system s woes

per passenger mile amtrak is 3040percent more energy-efficient than commercial airlines and automobiles overall though the exact figures for particular routes depend on load factor along with other variables the electrified trains in the nec are considerably more efficient than amtrak s diesels and can feed energy captured from  back to the electrical grid passenger rail is also very competitive with other modes in terms of safety per mile 
on-time performance is calculated differently for airlines than for amtrak a plane is considered on-time if it arrives within 15 minutes of the schedule amtrak uses a sliding scale with trips under 250 miles  400km  considered late if they are more than 10 minutes behind schedule up to 30 minutes for trips over 551 miles  887km  in length in 2005 amtrak s carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per passenger kilometre were 0.116kg for comparison this is similar to a car with two people about twice as high as the uk rail average  where much more of the system is electrified  about four times the average us motorcoach and about eight times a finnish electric intercity train or fully loaded fifty-seat coach it is however about two thirds of the raw co2-equivalent emissions of a long-distance domestic flight intermodal connections 
 connections between amtrak trains and other transportation are available at many stations most amtrak rail stations in  have connections to local public transport amtrak also  with  providing service between   via  and   and    and  special codes are used to designate these intermodal routes such as  zve  to designate the combination of new haven s union station and newark international airport and the amtrak connection between them amtrak also serves airport stations at    and

on-time performance 
outside the northeast corridor and stretches of track in southern california and michigan most amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by privately owned freight railroads freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to amtrak trains some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings for an hour or longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track the railroads  dispatching practices were investigated in 2008 resulting in stricter laws about train priority subsequently amtrak s overall on-time performance went up from 74.7 in fiscal 2008 to 84.7 in 2009 with long-distance trains and others outside the nec seeing the greatest benefit the  jumped from 11 to 95 becoming one of amtrak s best performers the  went from 22.4 to 96.7 and the  with a 5 on-time record in 2008 went up to 78.3 this improved performance coincided with a general economic downturn resulting in the lowest freight-rail traffic volumes since at least 1988 meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger traffic ridership

labor issues 
in the modern era amtrak faces a number of important labor issues in the area of pension funding because of limitations originally imposed by congress most amtrak workers were traditionally classified as  railroad employees  and contributions to the railroad retirement system have been made for those employees however because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work some critics such as the  maintain that amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as us 150 million year in recent times efforts at reforming passenger rail have addressed labor issues in 1997 congress released amtrak from a prohibition on contracting for labor outside the corporation  and outside its unions  opening the door to privatization since that time many of amtrak s employees have been working without a contract the most recent contract signed in 1999 was mainly retroactive because of the fragmentation of railroad unions by job as of 2009 amtrak has 14 separate unions to negotiate with plus it has 24 separate contracts with those unions this makes it difficult to make substantial changes in contrast to a situation where one union negotiates with one employer former amtrak president kummant followed a cooperative posture with amtrak s trade unions ruling out plans to privatize large parts of amtrak s unionized workforce public funding 
amtrak receives annual appropriations from federal and state governments to supplement operating and capital programs 
history of funding
amtrak commenced operations in 1971 with  40million in direct federal aid  100million in federally insured loans and a somewhat larger private contribution officials expected that amtrak would break even by 1974 but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of  1.25billion during the  appropriations were halved and by 1986 federal support fell to a decade low of  601million almost none of which were capital appropriations in the late 1980s and early 1990s congress continued the reductionist trend even while amtrak expenses held steady or rose amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs and by 1995 amtrak was on the brink of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts in response in 1997 congress authorized  5.2billion for amtrak over the next five years  largely to complete the acela capital project  on the condition that amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation while amtrak made financial improvements during this period  it did not achieve self-sufficiency 2000s

in 2004 a stalemate in federal support of amtrak forced cutbacks in services and routes as well as resumption of deferred maintenance in fiscal 2004 and 2005 congress appropriated about  1.2billion for amtrak  300million more than president  had requested however the company s board requested  1.8billion through fiscal 2006 the majority of which  about  1.3billion  would be used to bring infrastructure rolling stock and motive power back to a state of good repair in congressional testimony the dot inspector general confirmed that amtrak would need at least  1.4billion to  1.5billion in fiscal 2006 and  2billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo in 2006 amtrak received just under  1.4billion with the condition that amtrak would reduce  but not eliminate  food and sleeper service losses thus dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers only  and  services continue regular made-on-board meal service in 2010 the senate approved a bill to provide  1.96billion to amtrak but cut the approval for high-speed rail to a  1billion appropriation 
state governments have partially filled the breach left by reductions in federal aid several states have entered into operating partnerships with amtrak notably california pennsylvania illinois michigan oregon missouri  north carolina oklahoma texas wisconsin vermont maine and new york as well as the canadian province of  which provides some of the resources for the operation of the  route with the dramatic rise in gasoline prices during 200708 amtrak has seen record ridership capping a steady five-year increase in ridership overall regional lines saw 12 year-over-year growth in may 2008 in october 2007 the  passed s-294 passenger rail improvement and investment act of 2007  7022  sponsored by senators  and  despite a veto threat by president bush a similar bill passed the house on june 11 2008 with a veto-proof margin  311104  the final bill spurred on by the  in california and retitled  was signed into law by president bush on october 16 2008 the bill appropriates  2.6billion a year in amtrak funding through 2013 2010s 
amtrak points out that in 2010 its farebox recovery  percentage of operating costs covered by revenues generated by passenger fares  was 79 the highest reported for any u.s passenger railroad amtrak has argued that it needs to increase capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds what it would cost to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years however despite an initial request for more than  2.1 billion in funding for the year the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations dropping to under  1.4 billion for the first time in several years amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the northeast corridor included over 200 bridges most dating to the 19th century tunnels under baltimore dating to the  era and functionally obsolete  which would cost  5.2 billion to repair  more than triple amtrak s total annual budget  amtrak s budget is only allocated on a yearly basis and it has been argued by joseph vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossible 
in fiscal year 2011 the u.s congress granted amtrak  563 million for operating and  922 million for capital programs controversy 
government aid to amtrak was controversial from the beginning the formation of amtrak in 1971 was criticized as a bailout serving corporate rail interests and union railroaders not the traveling public critics have asserted that amtrak has proven incapable of operating as a business and that it does not provide valuable transportation services meriting public support  a  mobile money-burning machine  many argued that subsidies should be ended national rail service terminated and the nec turned over to private interests  to fund a nostalgia limited is not in the public interest  critics also question amtrak s energy efficiency though the  considers amtrak among the most energy-efficient forms of transportation the rail passenger service act of 1970 which established amtrak specifically states that  the corporation will not be an agency or establishment of the united states government  then  was issued in 1971 to railroads that contributed capital and equipment  these shares convey almost no benefits but their current holders declined a 2002 buy-out offer by amtrak there are currently 109,396,994 shares of preferred stock at a par value of  100 per share all held by the us government there are currently 9,385,694 shares of common stock with a par value of  10 per share held by four other railroad companies    formerly penn central  53   35    7  and   5  accidents and incidents
