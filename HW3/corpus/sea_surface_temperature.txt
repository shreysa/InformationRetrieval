temperature profile of the surface layer of the ocean  a  at night and  b  during the day


there are a variety of techniques for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured away from the immediate sea surface general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement this is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean s surface and strong vertical temperature gradients  a diurnal   sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the top portion of the ocean known as the near-surface layer thermometers 
sst was one of the first oceanographic variables to be measured  suspended a  from a ship while travelling between the  and  in his survey of the  in the late eighteenth century sst was later measured by dipping a  into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface the first automated technique for determining sst was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships which was underway by 1963 these observations have a warm bias of around 0.6c  1f  due to the heat of the engine room this bias has led to changes in the perception of  since 2000 fixed  measure the water temperature at a depth of 3 metres  9.8ft  measurements of sst have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken in the nineteenth century measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship however there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket the sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure the samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies these measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution a large network of coastal buoys in u.s waters is maintained by the   ndbc  between 1985 and 1994 an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial pacific ocean designed to help monitor and predict the  phenomenon weather satellites

weather satellites have been available to determine sea surface temperature information since 1967 with the first global composites created during 1970 since 1982  have been increasingly utilized to measure sst and have allowed its  and  variation to be viewed more fully satellite measurements of sst are in reasonable agreement with  temperature measurements the satellite measurement is made by sensing the ocean  in two or more wavelengths within the  part of the  or other parts of the spectrum which can then be empirically related to sst these wavelengths are chosen because they are

el nio is defined by prolonged differences in pacific ocean surface temperatures when compared with the average value the accepted definition is a warming or cooling of at least 0.5c  0.9f  averaged over the east-central tropical pacific ocean typically this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of 27 years and lasts nine months to two years the average period length is 5 years when this warming or cooling occurs for only seven to nine months it is classified as el nio la nia  conditions  when it occurs for more than that period it is classified as el nio la nia  episodes  the sign of an el nio in the sea surface temperature pattern is when warm water spreads from the west pacific and the  to the east pacific it takes the rain with it causing extensive drought in the western pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern pacific el nio s warm rush of nutrient-poor tropical water heated by its eastward passage in the equatorial current replaces the cold nutrient-rich surface water of the  when el nio conditions last for many months extensive ocean warming and the reduction in easterly trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water and its economic impact to local fishing for an international market can be serious importance to the earth s atmosphere
