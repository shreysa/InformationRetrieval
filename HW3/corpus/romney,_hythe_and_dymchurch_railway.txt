history
the railway was the dream of millionaire racing drivers captain john edwards presgrave  jack  howey and  the latter had constructed a railway at  his home at  and agreed to donate the rolling stock and infrastructure to the project however he was killed on 19 october 1924 in a motor racing accident at  grand prix before the romney marsh site was chosen and howey continued the project alone after howey had unsuccessfully attempted to buy the ravenglass   eskdale railway and extend it he investigated a greenfield site between burnham-on-sea and weston-super-mare in somerset and offered to buy the hundred of manhood   selsey tramway in sussex  drew howey s attention to the potential for a 15-inch gauge line between new romney and hythe howey first visited new romney on 8 september 1925 and decided there and then that it was an ideal location for his proposed railway because it involved crossing public highways and acquiring land from a number of different owners a light railway order made under the light railways act 1896 was necessary and application for this was made in november 1925 a public inquiry was held by the light railway commissioners in the assembly rooms at new romney on 15 and 16 january 1926 the minister of transport indicated his intention to approve the application on 19 february 1926 and the romney hythe   dymchurch light railway order 1926 was made on 26 may this incorporated the romney hythe   dymchurch light railway company as a statutory public utility undertaking gave it powers to construct and work the proposed railway and also included compulsory purchase powers over the land required  which ultimately had to be used to acquire six plots of land on the proposed route  during construction the railway was visited on 5 august 1926 by the duke of york  later   who drove the northern chief hauling a train of approximately 100 passengers from jesson halt to new romney and back opening 
the railway was opened on 16 july 1927 by   the locomotives were designed by henry greenly who was commissioned by howey to work on the construction of the entire railway  and became the railway s first chief engineer until his abrupt resignation in march 1929  hercules hauled the inaugural train from hythe to new romney with guests including the mayors of the two towns and general sir  howey was not satisfied with just 814 miles  13.3km  of track from hythe to new romney and plans were in hand for an extension even before the original section had opened the line was to be extended 512 miles  9km  from new romney to dungeness double-tracked throughout apart from a balloon loop on which the station at dungeness was sited a light railway order for this extension was applied for and following a public inquiry on 18 april 1928 the romney hythe   dymchurch light railway  extension  order was granted on 12 july 1928 ahead of this the line between new romney and the pilot had actually opened on 24 may 1928 and the rest of the line through to dungeness opened on 3 august 1928 since it was laid directly onto the shingle forming the dungeness peninsula it has been suggested that the extension was the most cheaply constructed railway in the world second world war 
in 1940 the railway was taken over by the military during  and a miniature  was used on the line it was also used by the department of petroleum warfare in the construction of   pipe line under the ocean  intended to supply fuel to the allied forces after the d-day normandy landings during the latter stages of the construction of pluto considerable damage was caused to the track on the extension when to speed up the work lengths of pipe were dragged along the trackbed by bulldozers resulting in its reduction to a single track after the war post war 
the line re-opened between hythe and new romney in 1946 the new romney to dungeness section following with a formal opening by  on 21 march 1947 regular services started on 29 march 1947 in june 1947 the  from  was transported by the  and  from  to  in kent it comprised an engine nine coaches and trucks and track totalling 222 tons in 1949 captain howey bought the duke of sutherland s private train including engine  and 60 feet  18m  coach for the museum at new romney it was transported there in 1950 and displayed until sold in 1963 from 7 september 1977 until 24 july 2015 the railway provided school trains to transport children to and from the  in new romney the service was finally withdrawn due to falling usage the railway s role as part of the local public transport network was extended when  re-opened in 2009 providing a link to the romney marsh visitor centre further discussions with local councils took place regarding the possible expansion of  and the provision of a new station at the gravel pits in west hythe in connection with both the proposed extensive new housing construction and the need to provide alternative transport to the  coast road the railway which carries over 150,000 passengers each year celebrated its 80th birthday in 2007 with a week of celebrations including reconstructions of scenes on the railway from the previous eight decades smallest public railway in the world 
from 1926 to 1978 the rh dr held the title of the  smallest public railway in the world   in terms of track gauge  the title was lost to the 1214in  311mm  gauge  in  in 1978 and regained in 1979 when that line closed it was lost again in 1982 when the 1014in  260mm  gauge  opened the railway has featured in several television and radio shows including an episode of the  series  in 2006 harry secombe s highway on 8 september 1991  s it s a square world in 1964 bbc s multicoloured swapshop  filmed on 20 february 1978   and children s show  
the romney hythe   dymchurch railway association 
formed in 1967 as a supporters association and regarded with some suspicion by the railway s management of the time the association has become a significant contributor to the railway s continuance and refurbishment it is now the largest single shareholder in the railway and its members provide a significant input of voluntary labour on both operating and maintenance work  it became a registered charity on 23 january 2009 at 31 december 2015 its membership stood at 3,355 stations

stations proposed 
stations which never existed but were at one time proposed by the directors or are currently under consideration 

hythe  red lion square  was first mentioned at the january 1928 meeting of hythe chamber of commerce by charles duruz a local nurseryman who had contacted the railway company and who indicated they were quite willing to build this extension nothing came of the proposal however in 1946 the possibility of extending the railway to red lion square hythe was investigated again but the east kent road car co ltd agreed to extend their bus service from folkestone to terminate at the original hythe station and the extension idea was dropped   suggested by objectors to the railway s original light railway order in 1926 as more useful than a terminus on the outskirts of hythe but demonstrated by greenly to be impracticable because of the difference in levels between hythe and sandling which would have necessitated severe gradients the idea was revived in the late 1980s to connect with the main line at sandling but again came to nothing although detailed survey work had been undertaken   a proposal was made for a station to serve this estate at  on the abortive 1980s sandling extension nickolls quarry  a proposal for a station to serve a new housing development at the west hythe site of nickolls quarry has been formally included in a planning application to  district council 



way and works
the line was originally laid using second-hand first world war surplus rail most was 25lb yd material rolled in the usa the rest was 12kg m rolled in belgium when the country was under german occupation in the late 1960s and early 1970s the railway managed to obtain supplies of good second-hand 30lb yd rail on the closure of the sierra leone government railway  these are the oldest rails on the line some of which date from the 1890s during the mid-1980s the company began obtaining brand new 25lb yd rail from luxembourg before switching to 30lb yd material produced british steel track products in scunthorpe and later obtained further supplies of the same from south africa the present standard rail for re-laying work is 35lb yd obtained from a manufacturer in spain the original sleepers were creosoted baltic fir spaced at 22 inch centres these have now been entirely replaced by second-hand standard gauge sleepers cut into thirds creosoted douglas fir or jarrah and karri  australian hardwoods from the eucalyptus family  the railway has a permanent way team with a full-time staff of  it forms part of the larger engineering department some platelayers work all year round whilst others are diverted to other seasonal employment within the engineering department for example as summer drivers when more drivers are required than during the out of season periods additionally the permanent way team is strengthened on many days of the year especially in the winter months by volunteer workers way and works data 
the longest underline bridge is collins bridge with a span of approximately 60ft the summit of the line is 20ft above ordnance datum located between hull road and taylor road lydd-onsea the ruling gradient is 1 in 75 at the dungeness end of new romney station rising from the littlestone road tunnels the tightest curve measures 6.8 chains radius and is at the hythe end of  the deviation  a   section of track at  on the outskirts of hythe the ruling gradient and tightest curve are the results of post-1972 reconstruction work pre-1990 references to these give out of date figures statements in a number of books claiming the summit of the line is at star dyke  a point approximately midway between burmarsh road level crossing and willop sewer  are only partly correct  whilst it is the highest point between hythe and new romney  it is not the highest on the entire line signalling
there were originally six signal boxes on the first section of the line to open  hythe to new romney  all were equipped with greenly designed fully interlocked lever frames constructed by jackson rigby ltd at new romney these were 
hythe  16 levers controlling points and signals within the station area now the only original jackson rigby lever frame in existence palmarsh  although this building is known to have existed there is doubt about whether the 8 lever jackson rigby frame it contained was ever fully connected up the frame was later transferred to greatstone  see below  the box itself had vanished by the late-1940s burmarsh road  2 levers located in the booking office and controlling signals the station building had vanished by the mid-1950s dymchurch  confusion surrounds the number of levers in this box with different sources quoting 10 12  and 16 the box had vanished by 1963 and signalling is controlled here today by a push button electronic panel in the booking office and a 2 lever ground frame released by an  normally held in the signal panel holiday camp  this building is known to have been erected on land owned by allnatt ltd since it is marked on the plans accompanying a combined conveyance lease concluded by the railway with that company and is shown as measuring 12ft by 6ft some rather poor quality photographic evidence of the existence of this box also exists there is uncertainty as to whether it was ever brought into use though and if so how many levers it contained new romney  17 levers controlling points and signals within the station area the lever frame was enlarged to the present 24 levers when the line was extended to dungeness in 1928 the extension to dungeness led to the enlargement of the lever frame at new romney  as mentioned above  and also the opening of two new signal boxes 
greatstone  the 8 lever frame originally at palmarsh was transferred here and installed in the booking office dungeness  like dymchurch it is uncertain how many levers this box actually contained arrangements for working the temporary turning wye at the pilot are not known locomotives 
all ten original steam locomotives remain in service each covering up to 10,000 miles  16,000km  a year the fleet already the largest of any 15-inch  380mm  railway in britain was expanded in 1976 with the addition of german-built krupp locomotive no 11 black prince  formerly fleiiges lieschen  busy lizzie  the rh dr is still the only user of the  mountain type locomotive in the uk with no 6 samson and no 5 hercules in regular service the fleet includes two diesels no 12 j b snell  delivered in february 1983 and renamed from its original john southland in may 2014  and no 14  delivered november 1989 and later named captain howey  locomotives in service 
including engines serviceable under overhaul awaiting overhaul or reserved to shunting or engineering duties 
a drivers vigilance device  dvd  has been installed on all  main line  locomotives except no 6 which will be fitted during overhaul

locomotive names 

nameplates are usually in  no 1 was named green goddess after the 1921  by  which captain howey had enjoyed nos 2   3 were to be called northern chief and southern chief and these nameplates were fitted at the works  however no 3 s name was changed to southern maid no 4 was sold in 1934 after construction because the proposed shunting and freight trains for it to work did not materialise it ran in  then  with the new name jean the engine regained its original name on return to the rh dr and restoration in the 1970s it bears the colloquial name basil the bug in its role as mascot of the railway s children s supporter group nos 5   6 were to be called man of kent and maid of kent but due to their high tractive effort  having smaller coupled wheels than the pacifics  the names  and  with their allusion of strength were substituted during construction a decade later  the designer was involved in the construction of a locomotive on the nearby  and this engine took the maid of kent name nos 7   8 were constructed with an extra third cylinder for express passenger services and were given their names typhoon and hurricane for speed the third cylinder was later removed from each due to unreliability the locomotives were originally to carry the samson and hercules nameplates but howey gave the mountain classes these names before the three-cylinder locomotives had arrived following a mishap when howey was at the controls no 8 was renamed bluebottle between 1938 and 1946 apparently as a punishment no 9 was originally black prince but exchanged its name with no 10 in 1931 its name became  in 1948 for a tour of canada and remained so afterwards at the same time the name doctor syn was transferred to no 10 and the name black prince fell into disuse no 10 was originally doctor syn but was renamed black prince following an accident in 1931 it regained its original name in 1949 to maintain the link with local history and legend a brass name plate survives suggesting one of the canadian outline locos was originally to have been called black devil in the event this name was never used george barlow the railway s operating manager received a brass rubbing of this from an enquirer when offered up to the cab side of doctor syn the bolt holes on the rubbing matched those in the loco s cab side perfectly some confusion exists over which locomotive actually carried the name doctor syn at any particular time if the real doctor syn was out of service for any reason howey often had its nameplates switched onto the other canadian outline locomotive no 11 took over the redundant black prince name upon transfer to the rh dr in 1976 in place of its german name fleiiges lieschen  busy lizzie  the name was chosen after a competition run by a local newspaper in which spitfire scored heavily but was considered rather undiplomatic given the loco s origins 
no 12 originally named john southland after the founder of the local secondary school in new romney has since been renamed after the railway s long serving managing director john bernard snell no 13 was never assigned probably due to superstition another engine of the same class as nos 12 and 14 was built in the years between them and exported to the  in japan where it is no 3 in their fleet and carries the name john southland ii no 14 ran nameless for 12 years until it was named after the line s founder captain howey pw1 carried the fleet number 4 for about ten years from 1961 as a replacement for the  engine which in turn had inherited the number from the bug which had been sold the engine was renumbered pw1 shortly before the return of the bug leaving fleet number 4 available again for its original holder pw2 was constructed in 1949 mainly by the rebuilding and re-use of a former war department locomotive which had been in service since 1929 popularly known as the scooter it has recently acquired nameplates showing this name pw3 redgauntlet was built c1964 by michel jacot and using a modified austin 7 engine originally ran on paraffin it ran trials at both the ravenglass   eskdale and romney hythe   dymchurch in the late 1960s and was acquired by the rhdr in the early 1970s 
locomotives withdrawn from service 
this list includes engines sold scrapped failed in trials or otherwise withdrawn all engines were internal combustion locomotives 
locomotives on site 
in addition to the railway s 17 own locomotives one additional engine is currently housed at new romney this is a partially constructed third-scale reproduction of an   locomotive commonly known as the  duchess  type  although of the 38 engines of this class only 10 were named after   the replica was commissioned by paul riley a director of the railway as a private project and is currently stored in an engineers  depot following the unexpected death of mr riley on 4 june 2008 the future of this locomotive is currently unknown it is understood that the machine is more than half complete passenger traffic
the railway was conceived and constructed as a public service not as a tourist attraction although it now relies on tourist trade school children were transported under contract to  to   known as southland s comprehensive school until 2007  this service was provided all year during term time the contract ceased due to falling passenger numbers after the summer term in july 2015 local residents are transported to shopping centres and the railway has operated  shoppers specials   trains have operated with camps at romney sands st mary s bay and dymchurch charters are operated as required during the  the railway was operated by the royal engineers and later the  as a military railway and there was extensive transport of soldiers on troop trains passenger vehicles 
at the outset the railway was equipped with four-wheeled 8-seater coaches designed by henry greenly and his son kenneth 117 of these had been built by 1928 with only half height doors and no glazing except in the end bulkheads these were totally unsuitable for winter operation especially to dungeness in 1928 the railway took delivery of eight fully enclosed 12-seat bogie coaches built by the clayton carriage   wagon company of lincoln which incorporated electric lighting and steam heating in 1934 howey decided to scrap all the original four-wheelers and replace them with fully enclosed bogie vehicles the 16 foot underframes for these were constructed by robert hudson ltd of leeds and the bodies were built locally by the hythe cabinet   joinery works ltd by june 1936 54 of these together with two matching vans had been taken into stock the rh dr now operates 20-seat and 16-seat open and closed coaches these have been built on four different types of underframe 

the original  20ft 3in  6.17m  long frames unaltered in length  used for 16-seat opens and 8-seat guards vans 
the 1936 16ft  4.88m  robert hudson frames extended to between 23ft 3in  7.09m  and 23ft 9in  7.24m  by inserting a new centre section between the swan-necks which carry the frame over the bogies  used for 20-seat open and closed coaches 
a small batch of all welded 19ft 9in  6.02m  long frames made by gowers of bedford in 1962 and unaltered in length  used for 16-seat closed coaches 
the remaining bogie hopper wagons acquired secondhand from the ravenglass   eskdale railway in 1928  used for 20-seater semi-open coaches 

the first batch of 20-seater closed coaches were bodied with utile  an african hardwood  pronounced  you-till-eye  and numbered 51 to 61 inclusive from coach 62 onwards aluminium has been used over 80 years the coach livery has changed from all-over green to brown and cream blue blue and cream green and cream chocolate and cream and red and cream in the late 1980s from 2000 rakes of coaches  trains of around a dozen coaches  have been painted in individual liveries and there are now maroon green blue crimson and teak coaches   heritage  coaches are chocolate and cream the railway has built several coaches to accommodate wheelchair users starting with driving trailer coach 105  heavily re-built after extensive accident damage in 1993 and later named marjorie  followed by 601 elsie then 602 winn and 603 may a new coach design featuring a lower floor for easier loading and a higher roof-line giving better headroom for wheelchair users was introduced in 2015 the first phylis is painted lined brown and normally runs with the teak coaches two further coaches iris for the green set and edith may for the teak chocolate set are under construction and will carry batteries in a compartment over one end bogie for coach lighting as well as the wheelchair compartment which has tip-up seats each will have a guard s compartment with  emergency  brake valve vacuum gauge side ducket lookouts and a standard seating compartment the guard s compartment has four seats and may be used by passengers when not in use by the guard
in addition to the main stock the  heritage  set is made up of 

the clayton pullman  built in 1928 and the last remaining example of a set of eight with superior comfort and design with twelve seats in three compartments originally with steam heating and coach lighting 
a preserved 1960s twelve-seat hardboard bodied coach named ruth 
the royal saloon  used by queen elizabeth ii and members of her family when she visited the railway on 30 march 1957  a luxury version of a coach design introduced in 1934 5 
and the licensed bar car named gladys  after captain howey s wife  an observation coach built on a 1936 robert hudson underframe extended to 32ft  9.75m  with a bar and 16 seats 
freight traffic
from the outset the railway s owners and designers envisaged freight services two of the original locomotives  no 5 hercules and no 6 samson  were built to the  mountain  wheel arrangement   unique on any british railway and giving the ability to haul heavy freight with only a small loss of speed when used on passenger work in the early years the railway carried a limited amount of freight  mainly  and fish traffic  a goods shed was built at new romney and featured dual gauge track allowing easy transfer between the standard and 15 inch gauges this was seldom used and was demolished in about 1934 the greater part of the railway s freight traffic in the early years was carried for the war department who made extensive use of the line to convey materials and equipment for the construction of the reinforced concrete sound ranging detectors they were experimenting with near greatstone a special siding was laid in joining their working site with the rhdr main line  the course of which can still be traced today   and the wd constructed their own locomotive to work their trains from time to time the railway has had short term ad hoc freight contracts for example one in 1975 to transport drainage pipes the most recent freight workings involved delivering gas mains from new romney to greatstone in 1989 as a publicity stunt the first gas main train was steam hauled using no 4 the bug which appeared on the local tv news that evening the railway operates its own engineering and  trains which now form the majority of its non-passenger workings dungeness fish trade 
there are several disused sidings on the beach at dungeness these were used by fishermen to help move their hauls across the shingle this joint provision was to allow transport of fish from dungeness to hythe and there to transfer it to road the company had four-wheel fish wagons stencilled  fish only  the service was developed from 1937 following closure of the  s dungeness line that year the fish trade developed in a small way and was withdrawn two such sidings are still in place but are both in a very poor state of repair although they were used by fishermen to transport fish across the beach for many years after the main railway service was withdrawn to facilitate the transfer of this traffic from rail to road on its arrival at hythe the track serving platform 1 there extended into the car park for some years uncrushed shingle transport 
the most successful freight service was the uncrushed ballast service following withdrawal of  operations over their siding near maddieson s camp the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains in 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed  wagons  skips  were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line and then up the main line to hythe often lying over in the sidings at dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks at hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp after the war the hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding  in what is now new romney station car park  the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders this practice didn t last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of new romney on the dungeness line the fence line can still be seen in 1951 after 14 years the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline at hythe the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding postal service 
the railway is licensed by  for rail postal services and is entitled to issue postage stamps a number of  have been issued a four-wheel secure postage wagon was constructed parcels service 
the railway operates a casual parcels service parcels handed in at one station will be delivered to another for collection this is the last remnant of the railway s freight services

armoured train 




romney hythe and dymchurch railway armoured train october 1940


during world war ii a miniature  was used on the line to patrol the coast in case of invasion the train was armed with a  and  proposed extension to sandling 
objectors to the railway s first light railway order advocated an extension from hythe to   2 miles  3.2km  away  to meet mainline services at  which they claimed would provide a more useful transport facility than the original proposals henry greenly undertook a preliminary survey which demonstrated the scheme was impracticable supposition that the  locomotives hercules and samson were ordered for the project which involved steep inclines is unfounded as the engines were intended for freight traffic in particular a contract with kent county council to transport up to 30,000 tons of ballast a year from their pits at palmarsh in the end this contract failed to materialize in the 1980s the directors reconsidered proposals to extend the line to sandling and detailed surveys were undertaken again consideration was given to motive power with new locomotives discussed although still called the  sandling extension  the 1980s plan was for a single-track line from pennypot 300 yards  270m  short of hythe to provide a more gentle route to an area known as the roughs where a more powerful locomotive would take over for the heavy climb to sandling station it would therefore have been a branch line rather than an actual extension to the existing mainline again the project was abandoned mainly because of the same obstacles as before tenders 




the tender from hurricane behind samson at dungeness


the following tenders are in use 

green goddess  re-bodied in 2009  and typhoon  rebodied in 2012  have ashford 1947 tenders  see below  northern chief and southern maid ran with 19834 built tma tenders which are similar to but longer than the  tenders and have a greater coal and water capacity northern chief received a new tender tank as part of her overhaul in the winter of 2015  southern maid  will return to traffic in 2016 with a new tender tank which will be a copy of her old tank the bug s tender was newly built in the mid-1970s as the original had been cut up during its time in a belfast scrap yard hercules and samson have since 2009 been fitted with new tenders to a design resembling the great northern railway  high-sided  type hurricane is coupled to the re-bodied paxman-built 1934 large tender complete with mock corridor connector  a feature of lner locos used on the non-stop londonedinburgh services allowing for crew changes en route  winston churchill and doctor syn have re-bodied gower tenders using parts from their original vanderbilt tenders from 1931 black prince received a new tender in 2008 using bogies and other parts from its original one which like the  tenders suffered from low water and coal capacity as built the loco and tender were fitted with air brakes which were replaced at the rh dr with vacuum brakes for the loco driving wheels only  the original tender was not altered the new tender fitted with vacuum brakes was tested at new romney on 27 september 2008 on 4 october 2008 black prince completed a 28-mile  45km  non-stop run from hythe to dungeness and back again without the aid of another tender a first for this locomotive 
greenly tenders 
of the seven  tenders supplied new with locos 18 two are still in service albeit with new bodies to the original design originally built with vacuum brakes and a handbrake both brake systems have been removed leaving them as through-piped only they were coupled to hercules and samson but withdrawn from mainline service due to concerns over safety and their coal and water capacity ashford tenders 
the  s ashford works built four tenders in 19467 ashford no 1 ran coupled to hercules but was built too high because john iron the southern s draughtsman sent to new romney to  measure a loco  took his measurements from a canadian-type pacific and not a british outline one the design of subsequent tenders was altered hurriedly after this and the second one ashford no 2 was coupled to typhoon the design was further refined and two more were constructed ashford no 3 was coupled to green goddess and ashford no 4 to southern maid ashford no 1 last ran in 1974 when hercules was withdrawn for overhaul ashford nos 2 and 3 are still in service with new bodies ashford no 4 was withdrawn when southern maid was overhauled in 1983 until 1959 when its tender was cut down in size hercules ran with the cab roof raised on blocks of wood to match the height of the tender tender shortage 
hercules was out of service after the burmarsh road level crossing incident in 2003 and samson was withdrawn from service for an intermediate overhaul shortly afterwards once both locomotives were back in service the railway was faced with a tender shortage samson was kept from mainline service while hercules was coupled to the tender from green goddess while it was stored prior to overhaul during the 2007 season samson saw service using the tender from hurricane while it was being overhauled  a situation that had also happened in 1949 when samson was used for ballast train duties  safety 




the level crossing at botolph s bridge was the first to be converted to an abcl






hull road level crossing just south of  before barriers were fitted


the railway has an exceptionally good safety record  and all staff  both employed and volunteer  undergo extensive training incidents 
there have been a number of serious accidents over the railway s 90 year operation with an extensive mainline timetable the majority of these have been related to  and in every documented case the road user has either admitted liability or been found to have been in the wrong by the subsequent investigation despite the presence of large numbers of visitors and tourists almost all recorded level crossing incidents have involved local car drivers the more serious incidents including those at level crossings have been 

17 august 1927 27-year old platelayer harold adams was struck and fatally injured by a train whilst he was working on the track near the prince of wales bridge 2 june 1931 locomotive no 10 then still named doctor syn  the exchange of names with locomotive no 9 did not take place until later in the year  broke away from its tender leaving its train near the coastguard cottages at lade the locomotive continued alone towards dungeness where the combination of speed curvature and cant deficiency caused it to derail on the loop and fall on its side the locomotive was just over two weeks old at the time 
10 may 1934 a train hauled by the rolls-royce locomotive was in collision with a large car at bonnington road  since renamed eastbridge road  level crossing in dymchurch the long-serving internal combustion locomotive  which carried no name at the time of the accident  was derailed and turned on its side receiving significant damage and narrowly avoiding a fall into the  beside the road the engine driver claude webb who was also captain howey s chauffeur was slightly injured in the accident a steam hauled engineers  train was coincidentally nearby at the time and quickly able to render assistance the damaged locomotive was sent to  in leeds for repair and returned to service later in the same year 2 september 1935 northern chief was struck by a  on the level crossing with bonnington

july 1952 a head-on collision between two passenger trains  one hauled by no 7 typhoon the other by no 8 hurricane  occurred just north of britannia points the station master at dungeness who was not in possession of the single line token improperly issued the driver of the up train with a single line ticket and verbally instructed him to take his train to britannia points and wait there to be shown the token by the driver of the approaching down train before proceeding the up train over-ran britannia points causing the collision 11 august 1952 the driver of a down train on the dungeness line 21-year-old jeffery reddecliffe was knocked out after striking his head on an overbridge a passenger in the leading carriage leslie j ashman saw this happen left the carriage clambered over the

5 hercules was derailed at half mile curve between new romney and greatstone the cause of the incident was severe gale-force wind the train was the 14.50 from hythe to dungeness and the leading vehicle  behind the engine  was a light  of a type nicknamed  jumping jacks  as their relatively light weight made for an uncomfortable ride for the guard in the severe weather as the train passed over the exposed embankment of half mile curve the jumping jack guard s van was blown over and smashed on the embankment fortunately the guard mavis thomas had decided to ride in another coach and so avoided injury as the van turned over in the wind it also tipped the locomotive s high-sided  which in turn tipped the locomotive which ended on its side down the embankment the engine driver bob hobbs who was a highly experienced driver had been alerted to the sequence of events by noises behind him and was able to jump from the  sustaining only cuts and grazes all  jumping jack  guard s vans on the railway were withdrawn from service and scrapped 27 may 1963 a train hauled by locomotive no 5 hercules from hythe to new romney was suffering from a faulty boiler pressure gauge which was showing erratic readings the workshop staff at new romney had recalibrated the safety valves that morning so that they lifted at what the gauge showed as 180lb sq in in fact the gauge was reading high after this the boiler was unable to maintain sufficient pressure to keep the train s vacuum brakes off and they were dragging the train stalled at palmarsh but the driver managed to get it moving again but at only 3 miles per hour  4.8km h  the train was struck from behind by the following service train hauled by locomotive no 7 typhoon which had been allowed into the section by the hythe signalman before he had received line clear from dymchurch a number of carriages in both trains were derailed  some telescoped  and there were a number of injuries the incident was reported in  together with two photographs taken in the aftermath of the crash 9 august 1967 a train hauled by locomotive no 5 hercules driven by jim brodie over-ran the terminus at hythe resulting in a number of minor injuries it is thought the engine driver was struck on the head at prince of wales bridge and lost consciousness allowing the train to continue unchecked for the remaining 112 miles  2.4km  into hythe station where it crashed through buffer stops and continued into the station car park coming to rest before reaching the main road the driver could not subsequently recall whether his head had struck the stonework of the bridge or whether he had been hit by an object thrown from the bridge the incident received national newspaper coverage april 1970 a train hauled by locomotive no 2 northern chief was in collision with a car at botolph s bridge level crossing south of  the swift action of the engine driver cyril carter resulted in a low impact collision and nobody was injured the

badly damaged and the engine driver peter hobson was killed the locomotive was sent to leeds for repair returning to service the following year although not the first level crossing incident on the railway it was the first to prove fatal to the engine driver and initiated discussion which led to the gradual introduction of warning lights at all the railway s level crossings 28 august 1975 a train hauled by locomotive no 7 typhoon was in collision with a car on st mary s road level crossing dymchurch the car a ford corsair was destroyed and one of its occupants had to be cut free having

the road the van driver was uninjured the guard simon oldfield who was travelling in the dvt was briefly trapped under water but was able to free himself and swim to safety the dvt was heavily damaged and had to be completely rebuilt during this rebuild it was adapted to become the railway s first wheelchair accessible coach two other passenger coaches 804 and 807 were also seriously damaged in the incident the van driver admitted fault but claimed that his brakes had failed the subsequent police investigation revealed that the brakes had operated correctly but that the van driver had vainly hoped to beat the train to the crossing police also found that the van s tyres were bald and that it had no current  a large crane recovered both vehicles from the water 3 august 2003 a train hauled

level crossings 
following the two fatal accidents in 2003 and 2005 the railway began a programme of level crossing refurbishment there are a number of occupation crossings with local control where the railway meets farm tracks but of the eighteen junctions of the railway with public highways five are road bridges and the other thirteen are level crossings during the late 1970s to early 1980s all thirteen had been converted to automatic open crossings  aocls  by installation of flashing warning lights between 2006 and 2016 twelve of them were upgraded to automatic barrier crossing locally monitored  abcl  status this involved the decommissioning of the life expired aocl control equipment the installation of lifting half-barriers and totally new control and train detection systems at a cost of around 90,000 per crossing  on 22nd of march 2017 the crossing at romney sands was commissioned as an abcl this means that all the 13 crossings on the line have barriers and it brought the level crossing upgrade program to a close during the single line crossing upgrades the road signal heads  wig wags  have either been replaced with new ones  battery road and dungeness road  or had their existing heads refurbished ownership and operation
the railway is owned by romney hythe   dymchurch railway plc which was originally incorporated as a private limited company on 15 november 1971 under the name rh d light railway holding company limited adopting its present title on re-registration as a  new   under section 8 3  of the companies act 1980 on 10 may 1982 its shareholders  of whom there are now over a thousand  travel free of charge on trains but receive no financial dividend on their shareholdings instead re-investing all operating profit back into the company at 14 june 2015 there were 25  gold medallion  shareholders owning 5,000 or more shares each and 119  silver medallion  shareholders owning between 500 and 4,999 shares each the remaining shareholders owned between 100 and 499 shares each the plc s issued and fully paid share capital at that date was 508,858 in 1 ordinary shares shares in the plc remain available to the public at a cost of 4 each the minimum holding is 100 shares but above this number potential shareholders may purchase any amount further details can be obtained from the company secretary romney hythe   dymchurch railway plc new romney station new romney kent tn28 8pl the two largest shareholders in the plc are the romney hythe   dymchurch railway association with 78,604 shares  15.45  and sir william mcalpine bt  leader of the  consortium  which saved the railway from closure in 1972  who holds 38,837  7.63  the plc controls the entire share capital of the older statutory romney hythe   dymchurch light railway company incorporated by the romney hythe   dymchurch light railway order 1926 it acquired a controlling interest in the statutory company on 14 february 1972 for 106,947.64 when it purchased 50,447 of the 51,000 statutory company shares then in issue since february 1972 it has bought out all of the minority shareholders in the statutory company which is now a wholly owned subsidiary the romney hythe   dymchurch light railway  amendment  order 1974 altered the capital structure of the statutory company allowing its issued share capital and borrowings to amount in aggregate to 400,000  instead of the previously completely inadequate 68,000  on 1 october 1975 the statutory company created a further 24,000 new shares bringing its issued capital up to 75,000 in 1 shares the plc subscribed for 23,950 of these new shares and the remaining 50 were acquired by a director of the statutory company in order to bring their holding up to the minimum for directors of 250 shares specified in the 1926 light railway order directors  shareholdings in the statutory company are subject to rights of pre-emption by the plc and are therefore treated for most purposes as being owned by that company it is usual for the two companies to share the same board of directors  with the anomaly that whilst the romney hythe   dymchurch railway association has been granted a seat on the statutory company s board it has no direct representation on the plc s board directors 
the romney hythe   dymchurch light railway order 1926  restricted the maximum number of directors of the statutory company to five and named captain john edwards presgrave howey gladys may howey captain john alexander holder major william bertram bell and henry greenly as the first directors greenly never owned more than 50 shares in the company so was ineligible to sit on the board and holder did not achieve the qualifying holding of 250 shares until 30 december 1929 gladys howey was also ineligible until 1931 when her shareholding reached 250 and she was able to join the board section 5 of the romney hythe   dymchurch light railway  amendment  order 1974  increased the maximum number of directors from five to 10 and also set the minimum number of directors at three operation 
the day-to-day operation of the railway is in the hands of a full-time permanent staff of around 35 assisted by 5 part-time permanent staff these include a general manager departmental managers  engineering commercial and operations  and a large number of engineering staff  from locomotive fitters to permanent way gangers  and catering staff  the new romney and dungeness cafes and the light railway restaurant adjoining hythe station are open all year round  some of the railway s other commercial outlets are more seasonal  in addition to this core staff seasonal employees are taken on through the summer season particularly to increase the staffing of the shops and catering outlets and to provide the required levels of staffing at stations at the height of the operating season there are over 60 staff on the payroll the railway depends upon a dedicated team of fully trained but unpaid volunteer staff members who work on the railway in their own spare time volunteer staff work throughout the railway in engineering posts operating positions commercial outlets and manual roles concerned with maintenance and improvement see also
