floyd originated as a  that exited the coast of  on september 2 it moved steadily westward and remained disorganized and devoid of deep convection until september 7 when a curved band of deep convection  over the center in response to a developing anticyclone at this point the  designated it as tropical depression eight while it was approximately 1,000mi  1,600km  east of the  a strong  of high pressure to its north forced the developing tropical cyclone westward over warmer waters allowing it to strengthen to tropical storm floyd on september 8 although a large storm floyd initially lacked a well-defined inner core resulting in slow strengthening and preventing rapid intensification on september 10 it organized enough to reach hurricane status and floyd approached major hurricane strength on september 11 while north of the  the central atlantic  along with an  in the eastern  produced vertical  over the hurricane and caused its winds to weaken to 85mph  137km h  a turn to the west caused by building of high pressures was followed by a period of   in 24hours  increased from 110 to 155mph  177 to 249km h  while the  dropped to 921  921  27.2  by morning on september 13 the third lowest  for a hurricane not to reach category5 intensity in the only  and  had lower pressures than floyd one contributor to the intensification was the high oceanic heat content along the storm s path hurricane floyd remained just below category5 status on the  for 12hours while crossing  making  on  and  islands before an  weakened it to a category3 hurricane with winds of 120mph  190km h  the new larger eyewall contracted slightly and the hurricane briefly re-intensified to category4 status a strong mid to upper-level trough eroded the western portion of the high-pressure ridge steering floyd to the northwest it paralleled the eastern  coast 110 miles  180km  off shore and steadily weakened because of entrainment of dry air and upper-level shear the storm remained extremely large however  at its peak tropical storm-force winds spanned a diameter of 580mi  930km  making floyd one of the largest atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded floyd accelerated to the north and northeast and weakened greatly to a category2 hurricane it made  in   with winds of 105mph  169km h  on september 16 after crossing over north carolina and southeastern  it briefly re-entered the western  before making a second landfall on   on september 17 the storm gradually lost its tropical characteristics due to an approaching frontal zone and became  over southern  late on september 17 the extratropical storm continued to the northeast and after passing over the  it was absorbed by a cold front to the east of  
preparations 
although floyd s track prediction was above average while out at sea the forecasts as it approached the coastline were merely average compared to forecasts from the previous ten years the official forecasts did not predict floyd s northward track nor its significant weakening before landfall nearly all of the  from  to  was under a hurricane warning at some point  however only a fraction of this area actually received hurricane-force winds the last time such widespread hurricane warnings occurred was during  in 1960 although the warnings for that storm were accurate

initial fears were of a direct hit as a large category4 hurricane in florida potentially costlier and deadlier than  had been in 1992 in preparation for a potentially catastrophic landfall more than one million florida residents were told to evacuate of which 272,000 were in  u.s president  declared a federal  in both  and  in anticipation of the storm s approach as the storm turned to the north more people were evacuated as a progressively larger area was threatened the massive storm caused what was at the time the largest peacetime  ever in the u.s with around 2.6million evacuating coastal areas in florida  and the

with a death toll of 65 hurricane floyd was the deadliest  hurricane since  in 1972 the storm also was one of the costliest in the nation s history amounting to  6.9billion  1999usd  most of the deaths and damage were from inland freshwater flooding in eastern north carolina bahamas 
hurricane floyd lashed the bahamas with winds of 155mph  249km h  and waves up to 50ft  15m  in height a 20ft  6.10m  storm surge inundated many islands with over five ft  1.5m  of water throughout the wind and waves toppled power and communication lines severely disrupting electricity and telephone services for days damage was greatest at    and  where floyd uprooted trees and destroyed a significant number of houses numerous restaurants hotels shops and homes were devastated severely limiting in the recovery period tourism on which many rely for economic well-being damaged water systems left tens of thousands across the archipelago without water electricity or food despite the damage however few deaths were reported as only one person drowned in  and there were few injuries reported to help the affected citizens the  opened 41 shelters though within one week many returned home the bahamas required  435,000  1999usd   625thousand 2017usd  in aid following the storm much of it in food parcels the  loaned  21million  1999usd   30.2million 2017usd  to the archipelago to restore bridges roads seawalls docks and other building projects in the aftermath of the hurricane southeastern united states 
although over a million  residents were evacuated the state was only lightly affected by hurricane floyd strong waves and tropical storm-force winds resulted in significant beach erosion on the east coast of florida as well as the loss of some boat piers in  and  moderate rainfall occurred along the coastline amounting to a maximum of 3.2in  81mm  in  floyd s winds downed hundreds of trees damaging 357 houses damage in northeast florida amounted to  46.5million  1999usd   66.9million 2017usd  a fraction of what was originally expected the states of  and  although threatened by the storm were largely spared when it turned northward some areas of eastern south carolina reported up to 16in  410mm  of rain north carolina

flooding in  on the 


the hurricane floyd disaster was followed by what many judged to be a very slow federal response fully three weeks after the storm hit  complained to  director  on his  program both sides now  it seemed there was preparation for hurricane floyd but then came flood floyd bridges are overwhelmed levees are overwhelmed whole towns under water   it s  an awesome scene of tragedy so there s a great misery index in north carolina  witt responded  we re starting to move the camper trailers in it s been so wet it s been difficult to get things in there but now it s going to be moving very quickly and i think you re going to see ai think the people there will see a big difference  this next weekend 
ecological effects 




runoff in the aftermath of the hurricane


runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of north carolina s rivers and sounds in the immediate aftermath of the storm freshwater runoff sediment and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in  and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero this raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills as had happened after  and  and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries strangely however the year s shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous  one possible explanation is that runoff from  caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters so they were less vulnerable to floyd s ill effects pollution from runoff was also a significant fear numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters particularly in the neuse river overall however the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in hurricane fran likely because floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them hog waste water contamination 
when the hurricane hit north carolina it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 million gallons of manure into the rivers which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality  duplin county director for environmental health said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm 9 percent or three times the average across eastern north carolina had faecal coliform bacteria normally tests showing any hint of faeces in drinking water an indication that it can be carrying disease-causing pathogens are cause for immediate action retirement
