recursive computation of certain derivatives-a study of error propagation a brief study is made of the propagation of errors in linear first-order difference equations the recursive computation of successive derivatives of exx and cos xx is considered as an illustration cacm January, 1970 Gautschi, W. recursive computation successive derivatives error propagation 5.11 5.12 ca700102 jb february 14, 1978 2:18 pm
