seasonal forecasts 

ahead of and during the season several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms hurricanes and major  category3 or higher on the   hurricanes will form during a season and or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country these agencies include the tropical storm risk  tsr  consortium of the university college london the   noaa  and   csu  the forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms hurricanes and major hurricanes within a particular year some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the dissipation of the  on average an atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms six hurricanes and two major hurricanes with an   ace  index of between 66 and 103units pre-season outlooks 
the first forecast for the year was issued by tsr on december 13 2016 they anticipated that the 2017 season would be a near-average season with a prediction of 14 named storms 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes they also predicted an ace index of around 101units on december 14 csu released a qualitative discussion detailing five possible scenarios for the 2017 season taking into account the state of the  and the possibility of  developing during the season tsr lowered their forecast numbers on april 5 2017 to 11 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes based on recent trends favoring the development of el nio the next day csu released their prediction also predicting a total of 11 named storms 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes on april 17  released their forecasts calling for 2017 to be a near-average season with a total of 12 named storms 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes the next day on april 18  released their prediction also predicting a near-average season with a total of 1115 named storms 46 hurricanes and 13 major hurricanes on may 20 the weather company issued an updated forecast raising their numbers to 14 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes to account for tropical storm arlene as well as the decreasing chance of el nio forming during the season on may 25 noaa released their prediction citing a 70 chance of an above average season due to  a weak or nonexistent el nio  calling for 1117 named storms 59 hurricanes and 24 major hurricanes on may 26 tsr updated its prediction to around the same numbers as its december 2016 prediction with only a minor change in the expected ace index amount to 98units mid-season outlooks 
csu updated their forecast on june 1 to include 14 named storms 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include tropical storm arlene it was based on the current status of the  which was showing signs of leaning towards a negative phase favoring a warmer tropical atlantic  and the chances of el nio forming were significantly lower however they stressed on the uncertainty that the  could be in a warm-neutral phase or weak el nio conditions by the peak of the season on the same day the united kingdom   ukmo  released its forecast of a very slightly above-average season it predicted 13 named storms with a 70 chance that the number would be in the range between 10 and 16 and 8 hurricanes with a 70 chance that the number would be in the range between 6 and 10 it also predicted an ace index of 145 with a 70 chance that the index would be between 92 and 198 on july 4 tsr released their fourth forecast for the season increasing their predicted numbers to 17 named storms 7 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes due to the fact that el nio conditions would no longer develop by the peak of the season and the warming of sea-surface temperatures across the basin additionally they predicted a revised ace index of 116units during august 9 noaa released their final outlook for the season raising their predictions to 1419 named storms though retaining 59 hurricanes and 25 major hurricanes they also stated that the season had the potential to be extremely active possibly the most active since  seasonal summary

three simultaneous hurricanes active on september 8 with   left    center  and   right  all three were threatening land at the time 

the atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 1 2017 although activity began earlier for the third consecutive year since  roughly a month before the official start the first storm  developed on april 19 in the northern atlantic ocean it was the first named storm to develop in the month of april since  in june two more tropical storms developed   which affected areas in the southeastern caribbean sea including  and  which formed in the  less than a day after bret had developed in july a tropical depression developed in the main development region  mdr  the second tropical cyclone to develop in the mdr before the month of august after bret and was followed by tropical storm don at the end of that month a cold front stalled over the gulf of mexico and portions of the southeastern united states spawning tropical depression six which quickly developed into tropical storm emily august featured the season s first hurricane franklin which formed in the  a few days after franklin dissipated tropical storm gert formed northeast of the bahamas eventually becoming a hurricane at a high latitude over the western atlantic on august 17  formed east of the windward islands before opening up into a wave over the central caribbean three days later harvey then regenerated into a tropical depression over the southwestern gulf of mexico on august 23 and rapidly strengthened into a category4 hurricane before making landfall near  late on august 25 harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 the first category4 hurricane to make landfall in texas since carla in 1961 and the first category4 hurricane landfall in the contiguous united states since  in 2004 





2017 atlantic hurricane storm tracks with imerg precipitation and goes clouds  from august10 to september23  

september featured copious activity irma formed in the eastern atlantic and rapidly intensified into a category5 hurricane east of the  irma is the strongest hurricane in terms of sustained winds since  in 2005 and the strongest hurricane outside of the  and gulf of mexico on record while irma impacted the northern leeward islands hurricane jose formed on september 5 peaking as a high-end category4 hurricane before weakening and making an anti-cyclonic loop in the northern atlantic ocean when katia formed 2017 became the first year since  in which six hurricanes have formed in a row on september 17 maria became a category5 hurricane threatening the same areas devastated by hurricane irma when lee intensified into a major hurricane on september 27 it became the first time in seven years that five major hurricanes formed activity briefly paused as september came to a close 
activity resumed on october 4 when tropical depression sixteen formed in the southwestern caribbean sea which strengthened into tropical storm nate on the next day as it neared the coast of nicaragua nate strengthened to a hurricane on october 7 and made two landfalls in the united states as a category 1 hurricane  the first near the mouth of the mississippi river in southeastern louisiana late on october 7 and the second near biloxi mississippi early october 8 as nate became a post-tropical cyclone on october 9 tropical depression seventeen formed in the eastern subtropical atlantic strengthening into tropical storm ophelia that same day ophelia became a hurricane two days later marking the first time since  that 10 consecutive named storms strengthened into hurricanes on october 14 ophelia unexpectedly strengthened into a major hurricane becoming the sixth major hurricane of the season and the easternmost major hurricane in the atlantic basin on record after this the basin went quiet for some time late in the month tropical storm philippe formed south of cuba tropical storm rina developed in the central atlantic in early november and did not impact any land areas 
the   ace  index for the 2017 atlantic hurricane season as of 09 00utc on november9 is 223.12units which is one of the highest values on record for an atlantic hurricane season as well as the most since 2005 and more than double the 19812010 full-season median of 92 units ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39mph  63km h  which is tropical storm strength with an ace value under 4units following the dissipation of emily 2017 set the record for lowest ace produced by a season s first five named storms despite that the 2017 season hosted the storm with the third-highest ace value  hurricane irma at 66.6 units  and is one of only four seasons  including   and   to have at least two hurricanes with an ace value over 40 and the only season to have had three 2017 also hosted the day with the most ace produced  september 8  and currently has the  september also generated the highest ace value for any month in the atlantic surpassing september2004

the nhc first began monitoring the potential for tropical cyclone formation over the northwestern caribbean sea on june13 a large area of disturbed weather developed within the region three days later and it slowly organized while entering the central gulf of mexico prompting the nhc to begin advisories on a potential tropical cyclone on june19 the structure of the system was initially sprawling with tropical storm-force winds well displaced from a broad area of low pressure with embedded swirls a reconnaissance aircraft investigating the system around 18 00utc the following day was able to pinpoint a well-defined center indicating the formation of tropical storm cindy despite the presence of dry air and strong wind shear the cyclone still managed to attain peak winds of 60mph  95km h  before weakening on approach to the  coastline it made landfall between  and  early on june22 and weakened while progressing inland a state of emergency was declared for  in anticipation of flooding a ten-year-old boy died from injuries sustained during the storm in  a second fatality later occurred in  
tropical depression four 

early on june29 the nhc began tracking a tropical wave embedded within a large envelope of deep moisture across the coastline of western africa the disturbance was introduced as a potential contender for tropical cyclone formation two days later as environmental conditions were expected to favor slow organization it began to show signs of organization over the central atlantic early on july3 but the chances for development began to decrease two days later as the system moved toward a more stable environment having already acquired a well-defined circulation the development of a persistent mass of deep convection around 03 00utc the following day prompted the nhc to upgrade the wave to tropical depression four located about 1,545miles  2,485km  east of the  despite wind shear being low the nascent depression struggled to intensify due to a dry environment caused by a  to its east causing the low-level circulation to weaken and resulting in the tropical depression degenerating into an open tropical wave late on the next day

hurricane gert 

on august2 the nhc began monitoring a tropical wave and its associated convection over the western coast of africa as the disturbance tracked west-northwest its structure changed little in organization but environmental conditions were expected to support the formation of a tropical cyclone instead the system remained poorly defined and entered a less conducive environment east of the leeward islands after progressing into the southwestern atlantic several days later the wave encountered more favorable upper-level winds and began to show signs of organization following the formation of a well-defined circulation the disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression at 03 00utc on august13  by 21 00utc that afternoon it intensified into tropical storm gert at 03 00utc on august15 gert intensified to a category1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 75mph  120km h  making it the second hurricane of the season accelerating east-northeastwards gert peaked as a category2 system early on august17 at an unusually high latitude of 40n thereafter gert began to rapidly weaken as it shifted from the  over cooler waters just 12hours after achieving peak intensity gert weakened below hurricane status and evolved to an extratropical cyclone well east of  two people drowned due to strong rip currents produced by the hurricane  one in the  of north carolina and the other in

a trough was present over the southwestern gulf of mexico on september3 producing a widespread area of thunderstorms two days later a distinct low pressure area formed about 50mi  80km  east of   at 21 00utc that day the nhc designated the system as tropical depression thirteen after an organized area of convection formed over the center located in an area of weak steering currents the depression drifted slowly eastward with gradually decreasing wind shear and warm water temperatures the system intensified into tropical storm katia on september6 as the convection became better organized later that day an aircraft reconnaissance flight into the storm found a partial  and surface winds of 76mph  122km h  on that basis the nhc upgraded katia to hurricane status the convection organized into a  as the system stalled late in the evening of september 8 katia made landfall north of   as a weak category1 storm the system rapidly dissipated over land on september 9 katia s remnants traveled across central america and later emerged over the pacific ocean where redevelopment ensued tropical depression fifteen-e formed which later strengthened into  about a week later in preparation for katia over 4,000 residents were evacuated from the states of  and  tourists left coastal towns emergency shelters were opened and storm drains were cleared before the onset of heavy rainfall two fatalities were reported in  from mudslides while a third man was swept away by floodwaters in  states of emergency were declared for 40 out of a total 53 municipalities that reported minor damage from mudslides and flooding about 77,000 residents were left without power at the height of the storm 
hurricane lee 

a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 13 contrary to predictions of only gradual organization over the following days the system rapidly organized becoming tropical depression fourteen at 03 00utc on september 15 the nhc upgraded the system to tropical storm lee at 15 00utc on the next day based on an increase in deep convection and an   ascat  pass which indicated that it was producing minimal tropical-storm-force winds after encountering wind shear lee gradually weakened into a tropical depression early on september17 before degenerating into a remnant low two days later the nhc monitored the remnants of lee intermittently for several days but regeneration was not considered likely however the mid-level remnants of the cyclone became intertwined with an upper-level trough  a deep burst of convection led to a new surface circulation and by 21 00utc on september22 the system reorganized into tropical depression lee it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later a compact cyclone lee organized as small curved bands wrapped into a small cluster of central convection a microwave pass around 21 00utc on september23 indicated the formation of a ring of shallow to moderate convection around the center often a harbinger of rapid intensification indeed by 06 30utc the next morning the presence of an eye on satellite imagery prompted the nhc to abruptly upgrade lee to a hurricane as it moved erratically after attaining winds of 90mph  150km h  the storm weakened slightly due to moderate southeasterly wind shear by 09 00utc on september26 however the storm attained category2 strength an eyewall replacement cycle that night led to the emergence of a larger eye surrounded by cold cloud tops and by 15 00utc on september27 lee attained its peak as a category3 hurricane with winds of 115mph  185km h  the system recurved northeast after peak intensity and quickly succumbed to strong northerly wind shear and progressively cooler ocean waters  it weakened below major hurricane strength by 03 00utc on september28 fell below hurricane strength by 15 00utc on september29 and degenerated to a post-tropical cyclone by 09 00utc on september30 after lacking deep convection for over 12 hours on october 1 lee s remnant was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone to the north

on october3 a broad area of low pressure formed in the southwestern caribbean sea the disturbance quickly organized and on october 4 the nhc announced that the disturbance had strengthened into tropical depression sixteen and began issuing advisories on the storm the system slowly became stronger and more organized and early on october 5 was deemed a tropical storm and named nate nate s first u.s landfall was in the mouth of the mississippi river as a category 1 hurricane and nate s second u.s landfall was at 12 30 a.m cst near biloxi ms both on october 8 after nate tracked inland it quickly weakened into a tropical depression and a few hours later evolved into an extratropical storm hurricane nate also broke the record for the fastest moving hurricane ever recorded in the gulf of mexico nate caused at least 40 deaths including 16 in nicaragua 11 in costa rica 7 in panama 3 in honduras 1 in el salvador and 2 in the united states 
hurricane ophelia 

main article  
on october6 a circulation developed at the end of a cold front in the northeast atlantic with a low pressure area developing within the circulation on the same day while the low drifted slowly to the northeast it began to lose its frontal system and acquire subtropical characteristics by october 7 the next day the storm encountered stronger wind shear removing some of its convection and slightly weakening the system  however the storm eventually grew better organized and developed more convection around its low pressure center later in the day early on october 9 the system fully transitioned into a tropical cyclone prompting the nhc to begin issuing advisories on tropical depression seventeen the tropical depression continued to strengthen becoming tropical storm ophelia later that day ophelia continued to strengthen due to low wind shear and on october 11 the national hurricane center upgraded it to a hurricane making it the tenth consecutive storm this season to reach hurricane strength ophelia became a category 2 hurricane on october 12 at 5 00p.m ast  21 00 utc  on october 14 at 11 00a.m ast  15 00 utc  ophelia unexpectedly intensified to a category 3 hurricane making ophelia the sixth major hurricane of the season and the easternmost storm of such strength in the atlantic basin on record on october 15 ophelia began to weaken while accelerating northeastward towards  and  with the storm s wind field also expanding early on october 16 ophelia transitioned into a hurricane-strength extratropical cyclone as it began impacting ireland and britain in  a woman was killed when a tree fell on her car caused by the winds from ophelia s remnants in  a man was killed while clearing a fallen tree with a chainsaw another person was killed in  when a tree fell on his car two other men died after suffering fatal injuries while carrying out repairs to damage caused by ophelia and  hurricane ophelia also fanned  killing 49 people 
tropical storm philippe 

on october22 the nhc forecasted that a broad area of low pressure would form in the southwestern  on october 23 as predicted a broad low formed off of the northwestern coast of  however the system remained disorganized for the next several days until the afternoon of october27 when it quickly organized prompting the nhc to upgrade the system into potential tropical cyclone eighteen slow development occurred over the next day but the storm was ultimately deemed a tropical depression at 15 00utc on october 28 after it developed a well-defined low-level circulation continued strengthening occurred throughout the day as it moved over cuba becoming tropical storm philippe near  about six hours later shortly thereafter philippe became poorly organized as it interacted with a non-tropical area of low pressure and a cold front with the circulation becoming elongated with three vortices existing within a broader low-level circulation philippe then made landfall over the  in southwest  with winds of 45 mph at around 9 00utc on october 29 effects were relatively minor in florida although philippe did spawn a few weak  including one in  and another in  after crossing the southern florida peninsula philippe began to intensify over the open atlantic reaching a peak strength of 60 mph however by 21 00utc philippe dissipated when the circulation merged with a cold front that was part of a larger extratropical cyclone that was bringing heavy rain and wind to the northeastern united states and  philippe did not become a hurricane thus ending a record-tying period with 10 consecutive hurricanes  with winds of at least 75 mph  the combination of philippe and the extratropical system resulted in approximately 1.2million power outages in new england the system produced storm-force sustained winds reaching 57mph  92km h  in  and hurricane-force wind gusts peaking at 93mph  150km h  in  in canada  reported 200,000 customers losing power because of damages due to winds of 70 to 90 kilometres per hour  43 to 56mph  it also rained heavily in  and  with up to 98 millimetres  3.9in  in the canadian capital region of  forcing prime minister  to use an all-terrain vehicle to leave from his second home on mousseau lake in  to go to parliament 
tropical storm rina 

in early november the national hurricane center began to monitor a non-tropical area of low pressure in the central atlantic which had formed at the end of a decaying cold front for potential tropical development gradually the system became better organized and was able to maintain an area of deep convection to the east of the center on the morning of november 6 the nhc declared that tropical depression nineteen had formed in the central atlantic as the day progressed wind shear from the west began to impact the tropical cyclone displacing shower and thunderstorm activity to the east despite this the system continued to strengthen and by 03 00 utc on november 7 the tropical depression was upgraded to a tropical storm gaining the name rina as it headed on a northerly track rina continued to strengthen despite strong shear and dry air intrusion and also began to show subtropical characteristics marked by most of the deep convection and strongest winds well removed from the center nonetheless rina strengthened into a strong tropical storm with peak winds of 60mph  95km h  the storm began to accelerate to the north ahead of an approaching cold front and was absorbed into the front around 15 00 utc on november 9 a few hundred miles to the northeast of  rina s remnants brought heavy rain and strong winds to the united kingdom and ireland on the night of november 10 and into the following day rina s formation in november made 2017 the first season since  to feature a named storm in every month of the season  june through november  rina was only the sixth storm to be given the  r  name in atlantic history and is the first r name to be used twice the first being  in   rina was also the first atlantic  rnamed storm that did not intensify into a hurricane

 there is an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 due to the lack of modern observation techniques see  this may have led to significantly lower ace ratings for hurricane seasons prior to 1910  the totals represent the sum of the squares for every  sub tropical storm s intensity of over 33knots  38mph 61km h  divided by 10,000 calculations are provided at   it should be noted that arlene would likely not have been detected without the help of satellites and there may well have been other similar storms this early in the year in the pre-satellite era  1966 and before
