reconstruction of a tano village in cuba



the name was derived from the arawakan word for  flour a staple of their diet the tano people or tano culture has been classified by some authorities as belonging to the arawak as their language was considered to belong to the arawak language family the languages of which were present throughout the caribbean and much of central and south america the early ethnohistorian  called the tano people the  island arawak  nevertheless contemporary scholars have recognized that the tano had developed a distinct language and culture tano and arawak appellations have been used with numerous and contradictory meanings by writers travelers historians linguists and anthropologists often they were used interchangeably   tano  has been applied to the greater antillean nation only or including the bahamian nations or adding the  nations or all those excluding the puerto rican and leeward nations similarly  island tano  has been used to refer to those living in the  only to the northern caribbean inhabitants only as well as to the population of the entire caribbean modern historians linguists and anthropologists now hold that the term tano should refer to all the tano arawak nations except for the  who are not seen to belong to the same people linguists continue to debate whether the carib language is an arawakan  or  or perhaps an individual language with an arawakan  used for communication purposes rouse classifies as tano all inhabitants of the greater antilles  except the western tip of cuba  the bahamian  and the northern lesser antilles he subdivides the tano into three main groups  classic tano mostly from haiti puerto rico and the dominican republic  western tano or sub-tano for population from jamaica cuba  except for the western tip  and the bahamian archipelago  and eastern tano for those from the  to  origins 
two schools of thought have emerged regarding the origin of the indigenous people of the caribbean 
one group contends that the ancestors of the tano came from the center of the  and are related to the  this is indicated by linguistic cultural and ceramic evidence they migrated to the  valley on the north coast from there they reached the caribbean by way of what is now  and  into  proceeding along the lesser antilles to cuba and the bahamian archipelago evidence that supports this theory includes the tracing of the ancestral cultures of these people to the orinoco valley and their languages to the amazon basin the alternate theory known as the circum-caribbean theory contends that the ancestors of the tano diffused from the  julian h steward who originated this concept suggests a migration from the andes to the caribbean and a parallel migration into  and into the  venezuela and the amazon basin of south america 
tano culture as documented is believed to have developed in the caribbean the tano creation story says that they emerged from caves in a sacred mountain on present-day hispaniola in puerto rico 21st century studies have shown a high proportion of people having   of the two major  found one does not exist in the tano ancestral group so other native american people are also part of this genetic ancestry culture

tano society was divided into two classes  naborias  commoners  and nitanos  nobles  these were governed by male chiefs known as caciques who were advised by priests healers known as bohiques caciques enjoyed the privilege of wearing golden pendants called guann living in square bohos instead of the round ones of ordinary villagers and sitting on wooden stools to be above the guests they received bohiques were extolled for their healing powers and ability to speak with gods they were consulted and granted the tano permission to engage in important tasks the tano had a  system of  descent and inheritance when a male heir was not present the inheritance or succession would go to the oldest male child of the deceased s sister the tano had  post-marital residence meaning a newly married couple lived in the household of the maternal uncle he was more important in the lives of his niece s children than their biological father  the uncle introduced the boys to men s societies some tano practiced  men and sometimes women might have two or three spouses a few caciques had as many as 30 wives the tano women were highly skilled in agriculture the people depended on it but the men also fished and hunted they made fishing nets and ropes from  and  their dugout   kanoa  were made in various sizes which could hold from 2 to 150 people an average-sized canoe would hold about 1520 people they used bows and arrows for hunting and developed the use of poisons on their arrowheads a frequently worn hair style for women featured bangs in front and longer hair in back they sometimes wore gold jewelry paint and or shells tano men and unmarried women were usually naked although women wore a small cotton apron called a nagua after  the tano lived in settlements called yucayeques which varied in size depending on the location those in puerto rico and hispaniola were the largest and those in the bahamas were the smallest in the center of a typical village was a central plaza used for various social activities such as games festivals religious  and public ceremonies these plazas had many shapes including oval rectangular and narrow and elongated ceremonies where the deeds of the ancestors were celebrated called areitos were performed here often the general population lived in large circular buildings  bohios  constructed with wooden poles woven straw and palm leaves these houses built surrounding the central plaza could hold 10-15 families each the cacique and his family lived in rectangular buildings  caney  of similar construction with wooden porches tano home furnishings included cotton hammocks  hamaca  sleeping and sitting mats made of palms wooden chairs   or duho  with woven seats platforms and cradles for children

the tano played a ceremonial ball game called  opposing teams had 10 to 30 players per team and used a solid  ball normally the teams were composed of men but occasionally women played the game as well the classic tano played in the village s center plaza or on especially designed rectangular ball courts called batey games on the batey are believed to have been used for conflict resolution between communities the most elaborate ball courts are found at chiefdoms  boundaries often chiefs made wagers on the possible outcome of a game tano spoke an  and used an early form of writing  in the form of  some of the words used by them such as barbacoa  barbecue  hamaca  hammock  kanoa  canoe  tabaco  tobacco   batata  sweet potato  and   hurricane  have been incorporated into spanish and english for warfare the men made wooden war clubs which they called a  it was about one inch thick and was similar to the  food and agriculture 




cassava  yuca  roots the tanos  main crop


tano staples included vegetables fruit meat and fish there were no large animals native to the caribbean but they captured and ate small animals such as  and other mammals    and   were speared and fish were caught in nets speared trapped in  or caught with hook and line wild  were decoyed with domesticated birds and  were taken from trees and other  the tano stored live animals until they were ready to be consumed  fish and turtles were stored in weirs and hutias and dogs were stored in corrals due to this lack of large game the tano people became very skilled  one technique was to hook a  also known as a suckerfish to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle once this happened men would jump into the water and bring in their assisted catch another method used by the tanos was to take shredded stems and roots of poisonous  shrubs and throw them into nearby streams or rivers upon eating the bait the fish were stunned just long enough to allow the fishermen to gather them in this poison did not affect the edibility of the fish tano youth mostly young boys also collected  and  in shallow waters and within the  tano groups in the more developed islands such as puerto rico hispaniola and jamaica relied more on agriculture  farming and other jobs  fields for important  such as the staple  were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil called conucos this improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion allowing for longer storage of crops in the ground less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by  technique typically conucos were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows the primary root crop was yuca  a woody  cultivated for its edible and   it was planted using a coa a kind of  made completely from wood women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices then they would grind the roots into flour for baking bread batata   was the next most important root crop contrary to mainland practices corn was not ground into flour and baked into bread but was cooked and eaten off the cob corn bread becomes moldy faster than cassava bread in the high humidity of the caribbean corn was also used to make an alcoholic beverage known as  the tano grew     and     west indian pumpkins  and  were grown around the houses other fruits and vegetables such as   and  roots were collected from the wild spirituality 




tano zem sculpture from  

tano spirituality centered on the worship of  a zem is a spirit or ancestor  the word  god  is a misnomer but will be used henceforth for better understanding  the major tano gods are  and  ycahu which means spirit of cassava was the god of cassava the tanos  main crop and the sea atabey mother of ycahu was the  of the  fresh waters and fertility the minor tano gods related to the growing of cassava the process of life creation and death baibrama was a minor god worshiped for his assistance in growing cassava and curing people from its poisonous juice boinayel and his twin brother mrohu were the gods of rain and fair weather respectively guabancex was the non-nurturing aspect of the goddess atabey who had control over natural disasters juracn is often identified as the god of storms but the word simply means hurricane in the tano language guabancex had two assistants  guataub a messenger who created hurricane winds and coatrisquie who created  maquetaurie guayaba or maketaori guayaba was the god of coaybay or coabey the land of the dead opiyelguabirn  a dog-shaped god watched over the dead deminn caracaracol a male cultural hero from which the tano believed themselves to be descended was worshipped as a zem macocael was a cultural hero worshipped as a god who had failed to guard the mountain from which  arose he was punished by being turned into stone or a bird a  or a reptile depending on interpretation of the

zem was also the name the people gave to their physical representations of the gods whether objects or drawings they were made in many forms and materials and have been found in a variety of settings the majority of zems were crafted from wood but stone    and cotton were also used zem  were carved on rocks in streams ball courts and on  in caves cem  were found on secular objects such as pottery and on  yucah the god of cassava was represented with a three-pointed zem which could be found in conucos to increase the yield of cassava wood and stone zems have been found in  in hispaniola and jamaica cems are sometimes represented by  turtles fishes  and various abstract and human-like faces

some zems are accompanied by a small table or tray which is believed to be a receptacle for   called  prepared from the beans of a species of  tree these trays have been found with ornately carved snuff tubes before certain ceremonies tanos would purify themselves either by inducing vomiting with a swallowing stick or by  after communal bread was served first to the zem then to the cacique and then to the common people the people would sing the village epic to the accompaniment of  and other instruments one tano  explains that the sun and moon come out of caves another story tells of people who once lived in caves and only came out at night because it was believed that the sun would transform them the tano believed they were descended from the union of deminn caracaracol and a female turtle the origin of the oceans is described in the story of a huge flood which occurred when a father murdered his son  who was about to murder the father  the father put the son s bones into a  or  when the bones turned into fish the gourd broke and all the water of the world came pouring out tanos believed that jupias the souls of the dead would go to coaybay the underworld and there they rest by day at night they would assume the form of bats and eat the  fruit spaniards and tano 
columbus and his crew landing on an island in the bahamas on october 12 1492 were the first  to encounter the tano people columbus described the tanos as a physically tall well-proportioned people with a noble and kind personality columbus wrote 

they traded with us and gave us everything they had with good will they took great delight in pleasing us they are very gentle and without knowledge of what is evil  nor do they murder or steal...your highness may believe that in all the world there can be no better people they love their neighbours as themselves and they have the sweetest talk in the world and are gentle and always laughing 

at this time the neighbors of the tano were the  in the western tip of cuba the island-caribs in the lesser antilles from  to  and the  and  nations of  the tano called the island guanahan which columbus renamed as san salvador  spanish for  holy savior  columbus called the tano  indians  a reference that has grown to encompass all the indigenous peoples of the  a group of tano people accompanied columbus on his return voyage back to spain on columbus  second voyage he began to require tribute from the tano in hispaniola according to  each adult over 14 years of age was expected to deliver a hawks bell full of gold every three months or when this was lacking twenty-five pounds of spun cotton if this tribute was not brought the spanish cut off the hands of the tano and left them to bleed to death these cruel practices inspired many revolts by the tano and campaigns against the spanish some being successful some not in 1511 several caciques in puerto rico such as       and  allied with the carib and tried to oust the spaniards the revolt was suppressed by the indio-spanish forces of governor   a tano chieftain who had fled from hispaniola to cuba with 400 natives to unite the cuban natives was burned at the stake on february 2 1512 in hispaniola a tano chieftain named  mobilized over 3,000 tano in a successful rebellion in the 1520s these tano were accorded land and a charter from the royal administration despite the small spanish military presence in the region they often used diplomatic divisions and with help from powerful native allies controlled most of the region in exchange for a seasonal salary religious and language education the tano were required to work for spanish and indian land owners this system of labor was part of the  women 
tano society was based on a  system meaning that descent was traced through the mother and that women lived together with other women and their children apart from the men because of this tano women seem to have had a lot of control over their lives their co-villagers and their bodies since they lived separately from men they were able to decide when they wanted to involve in sexual contact this is in part what shaped the views of  who came in contact with tano culture they reportedly perceived women as macho women who had strong control over the men most historical evidence suggests that although unclear it seems that tano gender roles were non exclusive to most of the activities done in their community tano women played an important role in intercultural interaction between  and the taino people when tano men were fighting intervention from other groups women were left back home turning into the primary food producers or ritual specialists women seem to have participated in all levels of the tano political hierarchy they went up to occupy roles as high up as being  this meant that tano women could potentially give permission to other tano men and women to take on important tasks and that they could too make important choices for the village there is evidence that suggests that the women who were wealthier among the tribe collected crafted goods that they would then use for trade or as gifts despite women being seemingly independent in tano society coming into the era of contact spaniards took tano women as an exchange item putting them in a non-autonomous position dr chanca a physician who traveled with  reported in a letter that spaniards took as many women as they possibly could and kept them as  some sources report that despite women being free and powerful before the contact era they became the first commodities up for spaniards to trade or often steal this marked the beginning of a lifetime of theft and abuse of tano women depopulation 
early population estimates of hispaniola probably the most populous island inhabited by tanos range from 100,000 to 1,000,000 people the maximum estimates for jamaica and puerto rico are 600,000 people the spanish priest   who had lived in   wrote in his 1561 multi-volume history of the indies 

there were 60,000 people living on this island  including the indians  so that from 1494 to 1508 over three million people had perished from war  and the mines who in future generations will believe this 

researchers today doubt las casas  figures for the pre-contact levels of the tano population considering them an exaggeration for example anderson crdova estimates a maximum of 500,000 people inhabiting the island the tano population estimates vary a great deal from a few hundred thousand up to 8,000,000 they had no resistance to  diseases notably  the encomienda system brought many tano to work in the fields and mines in exchange for spanish   and a seasonal salary under the pretense of searching for gold and other materials many spaniards took advantage of the regions now under control of the  and spanish encomenderos to exploit the native population by seizing their  and  it would take some time before the tano revolted against their oppressors  both indian and spanish alike  and many military campaigns before  eradicated the encomienda system as a form of slavery in thirty years between 80 and 90 of the tano population died because of the increased number of people  spanish  on the island there was a higher demand for food tano cultivation was converted to spanish methods in hopes of frustrating the spanish some tanos refused to plant or harvest their crops the supply of food became so low in 1495 and 1496 that some 50,000 died from the severity of the famine historians have determined that the massive decline was due more to infectious disease outbreaks than any warfare or direct attacks by 1507 their numbers had shrunk to 60,000 scholars believe that  disease     and   was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the indigenous people tano heritage in modern times 
groups of people currently identify as tano most notably among the  and  both on the islands and on  mainland some scholars such as jalil sued badillo an ethnohistorian at the  assert that although the official spanish histories speak of the disappearance of the tanos many survivors left descendants usually by intermarrying with other  recent research revealed a high percentage of mixed or tri-racial ancestry in puerto rico and the dominican republic those claiming tano ancestry also have spanish ancestry or african ancestry and often both frank moya pons a dominican historian documented that spanish colonists intermarried with tano women over time some of their mixed descendants intermarried with africans creating a tri-racial  culture 1514 census records reveal that 40 of spanish men on the island of hispaniola had tano wives ethnohistorian lynne guitar writes that the tano were declared extinct in spanish documents as early as the 16th century  however individual tanos continued to appear in wills and legal records for several decades after the arrival of the spaniards evidence suggests that some tano men and african women inter-married and lived in relatively isolated  communities in the interior of the islands where they evolved into a hybrid rural or campesino population with little or no interference from the spanish authorities scholars also note that contemporary rural dominicans retain tano linguistic features agricultural practices food ways  fishing practices    and religious views however these cultural traits are often looked down upon by urbanites as backwards sixteen autosomal studies of peoples in the spanish-speaking caribbean and its diaspora  mostly puerto ricans  have shown that between 10-20 of their dna is indigenous with some individuals having slightly higher scores and others having lower scores or no indigenous dna at all a recent study of a population in eastern puerto rico where the majority of persons tested claimed tano ancestry and pedigree showed that they had 61 mtdna  distant maternal ancestry  and 0 y-chromosome dna  distant paternal ancestry  demonstrating as expected that this is a hybrid creole population groups such as the jatibonicu taino tribal nation of boriken puerto rico  1970  the tano nation of the antilles n.y.c  1993  united confederation of tano people n.y.c  1998  and el pueblo guatu ma-cu a borikn puerto rico  2000  have been established to foster tano culture  tano activists have created two unique writing scripts the scripts are used to write spanish not a retained language from pre-columbian ancestors the organization  teaches and uses their script among their own members the    has promoted teaching their script among elementary and middle school students to strengthen their interest in tano identity see also
