a tropical disturbance was observed on november19 about 800km  500mi  southeast of   in the  the disturbance tracked westward gradually organizing and prompting the jtwc to issue a   tcfa  on november22 after passing south of sri lanka it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to  into a tropical cyclone the  associated with the system continued westward reorganizing on november26 in the  despite being located unusually close to the  the disturbance maintained  or thunderstorms which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation with low  and  aloft the jtwc remarked the system had a fair chance of developing while the system was organizing the center crossed the equator to reach about 0.5 thus becoming an  circulation in the southern hemisphere this was unusual as the  is nonexistent along the equatorthe coriolis effect refers to planetary  which provides the spin in a cyclone the jtwc later assessed the system as remaining in the northern hemisphere reaching as far south as 0.7n or about 80km  50mi  from the equator after the circulation organized further beneath the convection the jtwc issued another tcfa at 0300 on november28 three hours later the agency classified the system as tropical cyclone 05a about 1300km  800mi  southwest of the southern tip of india in a post-season analysis the jtwc estimated the cyclone became a tropical storm six hours earlier at around the same time the imd classified it as a  low pressure area likely to become well marked 
upon being classified the tropical cyclone was moving northwestward under the influence of a  over india its  to the north and south became better defined although its proximity to the equator limited its southerly outflow somewhat due to  early on november29 the imd classified the system as a depression and throughout the day it rapidly intensified to become a cyclonic storm  a cyclonic storm is a tropical cyclone with at least 65km h  40mph   sustained for 3minutes around that time the jtwc assessed the cyclone as reaching peak winds of 120km h  75mph  sustained for 1minute along with gusts to 150km h  90mph  late on november29 the cyclone weakened slightly only to regain its peak intensity by november30  at that time it developed a  and was located about 1500km  900mi  southeast of the coast of  at 1200utc on november30 the imd issued its first complete advisory on the cyclone naming it severe cyclonic storm agni and estimating peak winds at 100km h  65mph  the agency predicted the storm would continue northwestward and strengthen slightly before weakening at its peak the cyclone had a  of 985 



cyclone agni near peak intensity


after reaching peak intensity an increase in wind shear caused the eye to disappear and the convection decreased significantly on december1 the imd estimated agni weakened to cyclonic storm status around which time the center became exposed from the convection the cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear the presence of dry air and cooler  and by december2 the imd downgraded agni to depression status which was its final warning on the system as it approached the coast of somalia it turned westward due to the building of a ridge over  despite unfavorable conditions thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity by late on december3 agni weakened to below tropical storm status and the jtwc issued its final warning while the storm was about 450km  275mi  south-southeast of the easternmost point of the  the circulation became difficult to locate by early on december4 by which time the system had little remaining convection it turned southwestward and later to the south moving ashore on eastern somalia before dissipating on december5 near  over water records naming and impact 
according to rsmc new delhi cyclone agni developed into a depression at 1.5n which is the same latitude as where according to rsmc tokyo  formed during december 2001 however according to rsmc la reunion the precursor low to cyclone agni moved into the southern hemisphere and became an anticyclone as it had kept its counter-clockwise circulation agni was the second storm in the north indian ocean to receive a name after the imd began  in the middle of 2004 as the cyclone was weak when it moved over somalia no casualties or significant damage was reported
