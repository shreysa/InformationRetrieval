a cold wave  known in some regions as a cold snap  is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air specifically as used by the u.s  a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture industry commerce and social activities the precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls and the minimum to which it falls this minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year in the united states a cold spell is defined as the national average high temperature dropping below 20f  7c

effects 
a cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife exposure to cold mandates greater  for all animals including humans and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow grazing animals may be unable to reach needed food and die of  or starvation they often necessitate the purchase of foodstuffs to feed livestock at considerable cost to farmers cold spells are associated with increased mortality rates in populations around the world both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events in  more deaths occur during a heat wave than in a cold snap though the mortality rate is higher in undeveloped regions of the world globally more people die of cold weather than hot weather due to the rise in diseases like cold flu and pneumonia extreme winter cold often causes poorly  water  and mains to freeze even some poorly protected indoor  ruptures as water expands within them causing much damage to property and costly insurance claims demand for electrical power and  rises dramatically during such times even though the generation of electrical power may fail due to the freezing of water necessary for the generation of  some metals may become brittle at low temperatures motor vehicles may fail when  fails or motor oil gels producing a failure of the transportation system to be sure such is more likely in places like  and much of canada that customarily get very cold weather fires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable making  more difficult the air during a cold wave is typically denser and thus contains more oxygen so when air that a fire draws in becomes unusually cold it is likely to cause a more intense fire winter cold waves that arent considered cold in some areas but cause temperatures significantly below average for an area are also destructive areas with subtropical climates may recognize unusual cold perhaps barely freezing temperatures as a cold wave in such places plant and animal life is less tolerant of such cold as may appear rarely the same winter temperatures that one associates with the norm for   or  are catastrophic to winter crops in places like   or parts of  that grow fruit and vegetables in winter cold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth resulting in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be  economically such cold waves have caused  at times as deadly to plants as  cold waves can leave a land in danger of later brush and  that consume dead biomass one extreme was the so-called  of 1816 one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after  that reduced incoming sunlight countermeasures 
in some places such as  extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run continuously internal plumbing can be wrapped and persons can often run water continuously through pipes energy conservation difficult as it is in a cold wave may require such measures as collecting people  especially the poor and elderly  in communal shelters even the  may be  and taken to shelters only to be released when the hazard abates hospitals can prepare for the admission of victims of frostbite and hypothermia  schools and other public buildings can be converted into shelters people can stock up on food water and other necessities before a cold wave some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates at least during the winter suitable stocks of forage can be secured before cold waves for livestock and livestock in vulnerable areas might be shipped from affected areas or even slaughtered  can bring smoke that prevents hard freezes on a farm or grove vulnerable crops may be sprayed with water that will paradoxically protect the plants by freezing and absorbing the cold from surrounding air most people can dress appropriately and can even layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail they can also stock candles matches flashlights and portable fuel for cooking and wood for fireplaces or wood stoves as necessary however caution should be taken as the use of charcoal fires for cooking or heating within an enclosed dwelling is extremely dangerous due to  adults must remain aware of the exposure that children and the elderly have to cold historical cold waves 
contemporary cold waves  since 2001 

cold wave of november 9-12 2017 record lows were broken from minneapolis to dc as arctic air swept through the areas   a cold wave hit central and east europe at january 5 the lowest temperature was 45.4c  49.7f  degrees the cold caused at least 60 deaths there was also massive snowfall 

  caused over 100 known deaths across   and  

  during the second half of february 2015 temperature records were broken in both sides of the spectrum extreme warm records were broken in the western half of the united states and extreme cold records were broken in the eastern half in addition to the extreme cold wave at its most brutal in the great lakes mid-atlantic and new england snowfall were reported as far south as     and  the cold wave became widespread and all the remaining mild conditions from the west were pushed into northern mexico the cold wave even extended well into early march with a part of every u.s state except  reported a snow cover by march 1 2015 

  between november 8 and november 23 a polar vortex similar to earlier in 2014 has a temporary comeback delivering the 201415 winter season s first three named winter storms  astro bozeman and cato  snowfall records were confirmed all over the midwest and the northeast especially around the great lakes  was among the hardest hit in the unseasonably wintry november in addition to not being thanksgiving yet autumn colors were in the mix along with the deep winter snow 

  on january 211 cold arctic air initially associated with a  invaded the central and eastern united states and canada east of the rockies temperatures were even colder than the north pole and the south pole in many regions in the upper midwest and canada temperatures reached as cold as 37f  38c  and did not even get out of the negative double-digit temps in many places including  the cold wave extended for a few more months bringing a continuous pattern of record-low temperatures to most of the central and upper eastern united states before the pattern finally ended in early april 

  on december 1 the weakening of the polar vortex resulted in the jet stream shifting southward which allowed abnormally cold temperatures to intrude the  on december 6 a daily record snowfall of 0.1 inches  2mm  was set in the  breaking the old record of trace amounts of snow set in 1950 the cold wave continued into december 10 before the temperatures returned to a more stable range

spring 2013 north american cold wave  although the core winter of 201213 was fairly mild both march and april were unusually cold across the midwest resulting in sharp temperature contrasts from march 2012 to march 2013 all over the united states and canada this late cold wave was unexpected because february and march 2013 were both forecasted to be even milder and more springlike than february and march 2012 but instead turned out with a near-average february and an unusually cold march this same cold wave extended well into the month of april as four named winter storms  walda xerxes yogi and zeus  hammered through much of the northern united states especially across minnesota and the dakotas minnesota s winter even extended well into early may with one more winter storm  achilles  april is the month that usually symbolizes the majority of spring but april 2013 was known to be snowy and wintry for the upper midwest the northern plains and the prairie provinces
