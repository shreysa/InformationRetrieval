between june20 and 25 1957 an ill-defined  moved across the  over the  and into the  the system was difficult to trace until a report on june24 from  confirmed the presence of a  later that evening a shrimp boat in the bay of campeche reported sustained winds of 40to 45mph  65to 75km h  and a  of 1008   29.78  as the disturbance developed a large  extended from a low over the  into the  the  latitudinal superposition  of these systems resulted in the intensification of both situated over an area of high   approximately 85f  29c  and within a region of favorable upper-level divergence the tropical disturbance  overnight the system was declared a tropical depression early on june25 as it became stationary over the southern gulf of mexico an aircraft reconnaissance mission into the storm on june25 revealed that the system had already intensified into a hurricane reporting winds of 100mph  155km h  at this time audrey was located approximately 380mi  610km  southeast of  after attaining hurricane status audrey began to move slowly northward in response troughing in the upper-levels of the atmosphere continued reconnaissance missions into the storm revealed a well-developed structure indicating that the system had become increasingly powerful only one observation close to the storm s center was made from this point until its landfall  the tanker tillamook encountered the hurricane s western  between 0910and 1025 on june27 during this time a pressure of 969mbar  hpa  28.62inhg  was measured according to the  audrey attained winds of 125 mph  205 km h  shortly after passing this tanker making it a  on the modern-day  around 1430utc on june27 the eye of audrey made  between the mouth of the  and  while winds were originally estimated to have been near 145 mph  235 km h  at the time of landfall later reanalysis indicated that audrey maintained its 125 mph  205 km h  while moving ashore

after maintaining its eye 60mi  95km  inland audrey dramatically weakened and transitioned into an  as it turned northeastward over louisiana and reached  as a 995mb  hpa  29.39inhg  low at this point the system interacted with a wave extending from a polar front near  and subsequently re-intensified curving northward and later northwestward around another extratropical low the system attained a pressure of 974mb  hpa  28.76inhg  as it moved near  the rapid deepening of audrey as an extratropical cyclone was stated to be similar to that of  in  by this point the system was again producing hurricane-force winds with  reporting gusts up to 100mph  155km h  by june29 the system became entangled with the other cyclone and was eventually absorbed into its circulation over southern  preparations 
shortly after audrey was classified as a tropical cyclone the united states weather bureau advised ships in the path of the storm to exercise caution and small craft to remain in port on june26 in addition the weather bureau requested that texas and louisiana issue  for their coasts these requested watches were later succeeded by a  for the entire louisiana coast later that day this warning was later extended westward to include areas of the texas coast south to  northwest storm warnings were issued for the upper texas coast north of  while southeast storm warnings were issued for coastal areas between the western border of  and  these warnings remained posted until audrey made landfall small craft warnings were issued the next day for coastal areas between  and pensacola florida news outlets far removed from the actual catastrophe indicate residents in exposed low-lying areas were urged to evacuate by the weather bureau due to the potential for high and damaging  expected to be between five to eight feet in the wednesday june 26th 10 00 pm weather bureau update the hurricane warnings were changed to evacuate the southwestern coastal area of louisiana   some people ignored this warning while others found out too late while at sea the hurricane produced waves up to 50 ft  15.2 meters  in height on 27 june peak winds of 145 mph  233 km h  were attained as hurricane audrey made landfall near the texas louisiana border  the hurricane pushed ashore a peak storm surge of 12 ft  3.7 m  that caused much destruction storm surges of at least 1.8 m  6 ft  were experienced from galveston texas to cocodrie louisiana most of the 600 or more lives lost in relation to the hurricane were casualties of the storm surge  evacuation procedures in texas began after landfall was made on june27 starting with residents in the  area several power lines were redirected to  to act as an emergency supply in the event of a mass evacuation in louisiana schools were set up as  all residents on  were urged to evacuate after the island was isolated from the mainland during  a year prior  3,400residents later evacuated from the island to cities in southern louisiana however 600residents remained on the island during the storm civil defense groups in the state placed key personnel in the area on 24-hour duty impact and aftermath

the name  audrey  was soon retired and will never be used again to name a hurricane because of this it was the only use of the name audrey for the  hurricane audrey left  147million  1957usd  in damage and at least 416fatalities in the us most in eastern texas and western louisiana audrey is ranked as the eighth deadliest hurricane to hit the united states mainland since accurate record-keeping began in 1900 no future hurricane caused as many fatalities in the united states until  in 2005 a study conducted by the national hurricane research project report no 23 hurricane audrey storm tide conducted by the u.s weather bureau found the extensive collection of storm tide data available from hurricane audrey was not sufficient to permit a detailed reconstruction of the events as they occurred it was strongly suggested that warning procedures could be more effective if information concerning the tide heights on the open coast were available at proper places inland this information in addition to the other information concerning hurricanes would permit a better estimation of the ultimate storm tide peak this information properly related to other hurricane information should also help the local officials responsible for public safety to determine the seriousness of the situation at an earlier hour and might justify a forced evacuation if necessary information on the current state of the tide if promptly available at the right places should lead to a significant reduction in the loss of life attributable to hurricanes 
the afternoon and evening of june 26 1957 saw the cajun community of southwestern louisiana were tracking a hurricane in the gulf of mexico that was predicted by the new orleans weather bureau to make landfall listening intently to the radio and television reports and updates and any short wave radio transmissions that were available a disturbance in the bay of campeche was classified as a tropical depression on the basis of weather reports from the mexican coast and shrimpers in the gulf when a navy reconnaissance flight investigated the storm the next morning they found it was already a hurricane and it was named audrey the reports were bleak for the landfall area as the landfall deadline grew nearer and with advisories indicating the storm would not be until late afternoon on june 27th residents were busy loading and packing precious belongings into cars that were filled with gas and pointed towards lake charles and points north so they would be ready to head out at daybreak 
the 10 p.m advisory was said to be 235 miles south of lake charles with forward speed of 10 mph with probable landfall late the following day it was estimated the wind speed was 100 mph there was plenty of time the next morning to leave their beloved community as radio and television announcers telling folk to rest easy for the night and leave the next morning at 1 a.m on june 27th the lake charles weather bureau released an update bulletin announcing audrey had increased intensity of winds to 150 mph and a forward speed of 15 mph and was 150 miles from landfall the communities went to bed at 10 00 p.m with twenty three hours to evacuate and unbeknownst to them there was only ten hours left before landfall no one knew of the change in velocity and speed as the broadcasts were off the air for the day residents of cameron vermilion and iberia parishes were asleep and unaware of the danger approaching rapidly a flight which left corpus christi naval station at 11 18 p.m on june 26th never penetrated the storm after making one radar fix the mission was aborted due to radar failure the previous radar fix was made at 1 49 p.m on the 26th the information would not have been diseminated due to broadcasters being off air though waking up between 4 00 and 5 00 oclock with 6 feet of water coming into houses flowing under houses was not uncommon the morning of june 27th it was determined this rapid rise of water level was not a part of the storm surge but was a tidal wave being pushed by the hurricane about a thousand people sought refuge in the cameron parish courthouse of the three stories the first two were inundated with storm water mixed with sewerage and debris pushed on shore those who did not make it to the safety of large safe structures hung on in upturned roots of oak trees sharing their space with water moccasins and nutria rats who were seeking safety from the storm 
sheriff o b carter gave testimony in the bartie v united states that von lewin weathercaster for kplc in lake charles louisiana stated on the 10 00 p.m june 26th broadcast you can rest well tonight get a good night s sleep because the storm will not reach the shores the land before late tomorrow afternoon 
in a lawsuit bartie v united states in which multiple families sued the u.s weather bureau for not providing proper notification of the danger involved in hurricane audrey prior to landfall the same ominous warning   all persons in low exposed places should move to higher ground  this time the warning was coupled with  winds are increasing and will reach gale force tonight and early thursday  continued to create peace in the hearts of the cameron parish residents instead of giving better information that would have caused an urgency to vacate the parish there was a broadcast on both tv and radio immediately after the regular 10 00 p.m news on that night the supreme court of the united states determined that the broadcasters comments were made on the hurricane which were intended for lake charles residents primarily but which were heard and viewed in the cameron and coastal areas as well since the weather bureau did not control the broadcast the expressions  there is no need for alarm tonight  and  you can rest well tonight  could not be attributed to the u.s weather bureau

although making landfall near the border between texas and louisiana areas of eastern texas saw relatively less damage associated with audrey in  winds gusted to 85mph  135km h  while the barometric pressure fell to 966mbar  hpa  28.52inhg  the strong winds blew down communication lines and uprooted trees storm surge heights exceeded 6ft  1.8m  in coastal areas north of galveston farther south in  storm tides peaked at 4ft  1.2m  above normal washing out portions of  road a 0.75mi  1.2km  section of  between high island and sabine pass texas was later closed after sections of the highway were washed out by high water further inland rainfall peaked at 7.35in  187mm  at  setting a daily rainfall record overall audrey caused  8million in damages and nine deaths in texas elsewhere in the united states 
while moving inland audrey spawned 23 tornadoes which killed twopeople and injured 14 others in  and  while causing  600,000  1957usd  in damage in the midwest the flow of moisture from audrey intersected a weather front to its north creating a large storm with associated rainfall of 5 inches  130mm  to 11 inches  280mm  extending from central missouri east-northeast across central illinois and central indiana the 10.20 inches  259mm  of rain that fell in  led to a monthly precipitation record for june of 17.65 inches  448mm  and its wettest year on record with a total of 61.59 inches  1,564mm  it also flooded the entire town the storm dropped huge amounts of rain that caused significant flooding leaving 10 fatalities in  the storm produced 65mph  105km h  sustained winds while winds of 95100mph  153161km h  were reported in new york in canada winds up to 80mph  129km h  were reported and there were 15 fatalities as an extratropical cyclone audrey brought hurricane-force winds as far east as  where a gust of 80 miles per hour  130km h  was measured throughout the state countless trees and power lines were downed in  rough seas stirred up by the storm forced yachts to be grounded canada 
the remnants of audrey entered ontario with tropical storm force winds after crossing  heavy rainfall in the province washed out roads and rail lines six people were trapped in  for four days due to dangerous river currents and downed trees blocking roads one boy drowned and a firefighter died due to the storm and three other people died in ontario due to traffic accidents in neighboring quebec the remnants of audrey were considered the worst storm in about 20years and over 100houses were damaged by floods the  district of  lost power for several days throughout montreal there were 10deaths nine of which due to traffic accidents this made audrey the deadliest tropical cyclone in quebec on record
