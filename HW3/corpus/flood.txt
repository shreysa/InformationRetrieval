a flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry the   eu   defines a flood as a covering by  of land not normally covered by water in the sense of  flowing water  the word may also be applied to the inflow of the  flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies such as a   or ocean in which the water overtops or breaks  resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood while the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in  and snow melt these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood  or   floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the  particularly at bends or  in the  floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers while riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and  and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry some floods develop slowly while others such as  can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain additionally floods can be local impacting a neighborhood or community or very large affecting entire river basins

etymology
the word  flood  comes from the  flod a word common to   compare  flut  vloed from the same root as is seen in flow float  also compare with  fluctus flumen   are  stories of a great flood sent by a  or deities to destroy civilization as an act of  and they are featured in the mythology of many cultures principal types
areal
floods can happen on flat or low-lying areas when water is supplied by rainfall or snowmelt more rapidly than it can either  or  the excess accumulates in place sometimes to hazardous depths surface  can become saturated which effectively stops infiltration where the  is shallow such as a  or from intense rain from one or a  infiltration also is slow to negligible through frozen ground rock  paving or roofs areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in local depressions not connected to a stream channel because the velocity of  depends on the surface slope  may experience areal flooding during periods when precipitation exceeds evaporation riverine  channel 
floods occur in all types of  and  channels from the smallest  in humid zones to  in arid climates to the  rivers when overland flow occurs on tilled fields it can result in a  where  are  and carried as suspended matter or  localized flooding may be caused or exacerbated by drainage obstructions such as    or  dams slow-rising floods most commonly occur in large rivers with large  the increase in flow may be the result of sustained rainfall rapid snow melt  or  however large rivers may have rapid flooding events in areas with dry climate since they may have large basins but small river channels and rainfall can be very intense in smaller areas of those basins rapid flooding events including  more often occur on smaller rivers rivers with steep valleys rivers that flow for much of their length over impermeable terrain or normally-dry channels the cause may be localized   intense   or sudden release from an upstream impoundment created behind a  landslide or  in one instance a flash flood killed eight people enjoying the water on a sunday afternoon at a popular waterfall in a narrow canyon without any observed rainfall the flow rate increased from about 50 to 1,500 cubic feet per second  1.4 to 42m3 s  in just one minute two larger floods occurred at the same site within a week but no one was at the waterfall on those days the deadly flood resulted from a thunderstorm over part of the drainage basin where steep bare rock slopes are common and the thin soil was already saturated flash floods are the most common flood type in normally-dry channels in arid zones known as  in the southwest united states and many other names elsewhere in that setting the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy stream bed the leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows as a result the rising limb of the  becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream until the flow rate is so great that the depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant estuarine and coastal
flooding in  is commonly caused by a combination of sea tidal surges caused by  and low  and they may be exacerbated by high upstream river flow coastal areas may be flooded by storm events at sea resulting in waves over-topping defenses or in severe cases by  or tropical cyclones a  from either a  or an  falls within this category research from the nhc  national hurricane center  explains   storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm over and above the predicted astronomical tides  should not be confused with storm tide which is defined as the water level rise due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide this rise in water level can cause extreme flooding in coastal areas particularly when storm surge coincides with normal high tide resulting in storm tides reaching up to 20 feet or more in some cases 
urban flooding
urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a  particularly in more densely populated areas caused by rainfall overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems such as  although sometimes triggered by events such as flash flooding or  urban flooding is a condition characterized by its repetitive and systemic impacts on communities that can happen regardless of whether or not affected communities are located within designated floodplains or near any body of water aside from potential overflow of rivers and lakes snowmelt  or water released from damaged  may accumulate on property and in public rights-of-way seep through building walls and floors or backup into buildings through sewer pipes toilets and sinks in urban areas flood effects can be exacerbated by existing paved streets and roads which increase the speed of flowing water the flood flow in urbanized areas constitutes a hazard to both the population and infrastructure some recent catastrophes include the inundations of   france  in 1998 and   france  in 1992 the flooding of   usa  in 2005 and the flooding in    during the 20102011 summer in   australia  flood flows in urban environments have been studied relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events some recent research has considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals in flooded areas catastrophic
catastrophic riverine flooding is usually associated with major infrastructure failures such as the collapse of a dam but they may also be caused by drainage channel modification from a   or  examples include  and   can cause catastrophic coastal flooding most commonly resulting from undersea earthquakes causes

upslope factors
the amount location and timing of water reaching a drainage channel from natural precipitation and controlled or uncontrolled reservoir releases determines the flow at downstream locations some precipitation evaporates some slowly percolates through soil some may be temporarily sequestered as snow or ice and some may produce rapid runoff from surfaces including rock pavement roofs and saturated or frozen ground the fraction of incident precipitation promptly reaching a drainage channel has been observed from nil for light rain on dry level ground to as high as 170 percent for warm rain on accumulated snow most precipitation records are based on a measured depth of water received within a fixed time interval frequency of a precipitation threshold of interest may be determined from the number of measurements exceeding that threshold value within the total time period for which observations are available individual data points are converted to intensity by dividing each measured depth by the period of time between observations this intensity will be less than the actual peak intensity if the duration of the rainfall event was less than the fixed time interval for which measurements are reported convective precipitation events  thunderstorms  tend to produce shorter duration storm events than orographic precipitation duration intensity and frequency of rainfall events are important to flood prediction short duration precipitation is more significant to flooding within small drainage basins the most important upslope factor in determining flood magnitude is the land area of the watershed upstream of the area of interest rainfall intensity is the second most important factor for watersheds of less than approximately 30 square miles or 80 square kilometres the main channel slope is the second most important factor for larger watersheds channel slope and rainfall intensity become the third most important factors for small and large watersheds respectively  is the time required for runoff from the most distant point of the upstream drainage area to reach the point of the drainage channel controlling flooding of the area of interest the time of concentration defines the critical duration of peak rainfall for the area of interest the critical duration of intense rainfall might be only a few minutes for roof and parking lot drainage structures while cumulative rainfall over several days would be critical for river basins downslope factors
water flowing downhill ultimately encounters downstream conditions slowing movement the final limitation is often the  or a natural or artificial  elevation changes such as tidal fluctuations are significant determinants of coastal and estuarine flooding less predictable events like tsunamis and storm surges may also cause elevation changes in large bodies of water elevation of flowing water is controlled by the geometry of the flow channel flow channel restrictions like bridges and canyons tend to control water elevation above the restriction the actual control point for any given reach of the drainage may change with changing water elevation so a closer point may control for lower water levels until a more distant point controls at higher water levels effective flood channel geometry may be changed by growth of vegetation accumulation of ice or debris or construction of bridges buildings or levees within the flood channel coincidence
extreme flood events often result from coincidence such as unusually intense warm rainfall melting heavy snow pack producing channel obstructions from floating ice and releasing small impoundments like  dams coincident events may cause extensive flooding to be more frequent than anticipated from  considering only precipitation runoff flowing within unobstructed drainage channels debris modification of channel geometry is common when heavy flows move uprooted woody vegetation and flood-damaged structures and vehicles including boats and  equipment recent field measurements during the  showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by velocity and water depth fluctuations these considerations ignore further the risks associated with large debris entrained by the flow motion some researchers have mentioned the storage effect in urban areas with transportation corridors created by  culverted fills may be converted to impoundments if the  become blocked by debris and flow may be diverted along streets several studies have looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication on flood modelling effects
primary effects
the primary effects of flooding include  damage to buildings and other structures including bridges  systems roadways and canals floods also frequently damage  and sometimes  which then has  caused by the loss of power this includes loss of drinking  and water supply which may result in loss of drinking water or severe water contamination it may also cause the loss of sewage disposal facilities lack of clean water combined with  in the flood waters raises the risk of  which can include     and many other diseases depending upon the location of the flood damage to roads and transport infrastructure may make it difficult to mobilize aid to those affected or to provide emergency health treatment flood waters typically inundate farm land making the land unworkable and preventing crops from being planted or harvested which can lead to shortages of food both for humans and farm animals entire harvests for a country can be lost in extreme flood circumstances some tree species may not survive prolonged flooding of their root systems secondary and long-term effects
economic hardship due to a temporary decline in tourism rebuilding costs or food shortages leading to price increases is a common after-effect of severe flooding the impact on those affected may cause psychological damage to those affected in particular where deaths serious injuries and loss of property occur urban flooding can lead to chronically wet houses which are linked to an increase in  problems and other illnesses urban flooding also has significant economic implications for affected neighborhoods in the  industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 1025 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home according to the u.s   fema  almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster in the united states  is available against flood damage to both homes and businesses benefits
floods  in particular more frequent or smaller floods  can also bring many benefits such as recharging  making soil more  and increasing  in some soils flood waters provide much needed water resources in  and  regions where precipitation can be very unevenly distributed throughout the year and kills pests in the farming land freshwater floods particularly play an important role in maintaining  in river corridors and are a key factor in maintaining floodplain  flooding can spread nutrients to lakes and rivers which can lead to increased  and improved  for a few years for some fish species an inundated floodplain may form a highly suitable location for  with few predators and enhanced levels of nutrients or food fish such as the  make use of floods in order to reach new habitats bird populations may also profit from the boost in food production caused by flooding periodic flooding was essential to the well-being of ancient communities along the  rivers the  the  the  and the  among others the viability of  a renewable source of energy is also higher in flood prone regions flood safety planning
at the most basic level the best defense against floods is to seek higher ground for high-value uses while balancing the foreseeable risks with the benefits of occupying flood hazard zones 2223 critical community-safety facilities such as hospitals emergency-operations centers and police fire and  services should be built in areas least at risk of flooding structures such as bridges that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas should be designed to withstand flooding areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent planning for flood safety involves many aspects of analysis and engineering including 

observation of previous and present flood heights and inundated areas statistical  and hydraulic model analyses mapping inundated areas and flood heights for future flood scenarios long-term  and regulation  and construction of structures to control or withstand flooding intermediate-term monitoring  and emergency-response planning and
short-term monitoring  and response operations 
each topic presents distinct yet related questions with varying scope and scale in time space and the people involved attempts to understand and manage the mechanisms at work in floodplains have been made for at least six millennia 
in the united states the association of state floodplain managers works to promote education policies and activities that mitigate current and future losses costs and human suffering caused by flooding and to protect the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains  all without causing adverse impacts a portfolio of  examples for  in the united states is available from the federal emergency management agency control

in many countries around the world waterways prone to floods are often carefully managed defenses such as     and  are used to prevent waterways from overflowing their banks when these defenses fail emergency measures such as  or portable inflatable tubes are often used to try to stem flooding coastal flooding has been addressed in portions of europe and the americas with  such as   and  in the  near rivers and streams  measures can be taken to try to slow down or reverse the natural forces that cause many waterways to meander over long periods of time flood controls such as dams can be built and maintained over time to try to reduce the occurrence and severity of floods as well in the united states the  maintains a network of such flood control dams in areas prone to urban flooding one solution is the repair and expansion of man-made sewer systems and stormwater infrastructure another strategy is to reduce impervious surfaces in streets parking lots and buildings through natural drainage channels  and   collectively known as  or   suds  areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated protected by  and  or designed to withstand temporary inundation property owners can also invest in solutions themselves such as re-landscaping their property to take the flow of water away from their building and installing   and  analysis of flood information
a series of annual maximum flow rates in a stream reach can be analyzed  to estimate the  and floods of other  there similar estimates from many sites in a hydrologically similar region can be related to measurable characteristics of each drainage basin to allow  of flood recurrence intervals for stream reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis physical process models of channel reaches are generally well understood and will calculate the depth and area of inundation for given channel conditions and a specified flow rate such as for use in floodplain mapping and  conversely given the observed inundation area of a recent flood and the channel conditions a model can calculate the flow rate applied to various potential channel configurations and flow rates a reach model can contribute to selecting an optimum design for a modified channel various reach models are available as of 2015 either  models  flood levels measured in the   or  models  variable flood depths measured across the extent of a floodplain   the hydraulic engineering center model is among the most popular  if only because it is available free of charge other models such as tuflow combine 1d and 2d components to derive flood depths across both river channels and the entire floodplain  of complete drainage basins are even more complex although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area others are poorly understood at all scales and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown basin models typically combine land-surface process components  to estimate how much rainfall or snowmelt reaches a channel  with a series of reach models for example a basin model can calculate the runoff  that might result from a 100-year storm although the recurrence interval of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood basin models are commonly used in flood forecasting and warning as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and  flood forecasting
main articles   and 
anticipating floods before they occur allows for precautions to be taken and people to be warned  so that they can be prepared in advance for flooding conditions for example farmers can remove animals from low-lying areas and utility services can put in place emergency provisions to re-route services if needed emergency services can also make provisions to have enough resources available ahead of time to respond to emergencies as they occur people can evacuate areas to be flooded in order to make the most accurate flood forecasts for  it is best to have a long time-series of historical data that relates  to measured past rainfall events coupling this historical information with  about volumetric capacity in catchment areas such as spare capacity in reservoirs ground-water levels and the degree of  of area  is also needed in order to make the most acrate flood forecasts  estimates of rainfall and general  techniques are also important components of good flood forecasting in areas where good quality data is available the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time the output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway and it also may allow for the computation of the likely statistical return period of a flood in many developed countries urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood  that is a flood that has a probability of around 63 of occurring in any 100-year period of time according to the u.s   nws  northeast river forecast center  rfc  in  a rule of thumb for flood forecasting in urban areas is that it takes at least 1 inch  25mm  of rainfall in around an hour s time in order to start significant  of water on  many nws rfcs routinely issue flash flood guidance and headwater guidance which indicate the general amount of rainfall that would need to fall in a short period of time in order to cause flash flooding or flooding on larger  in the united states an integrated approach to real-time hydrologic computer modelling utilizes observed data from the   usgs  various  various  the  national operational hydrologic remote sensing center  nohrsc  various  companies etc combined with   qpf  of expected rainfall and or snow melt to generate daily or as-needed hydrologic forecasts the nws also cooperates with  on hydrologic forecasts that affect both the usa and canada like in the area of the  the global flood monitoring system  gfms  a computer tool which maps flood conditions worldwide is available  users anywhere in the world can use gfms to determine when floods may occur in their area gfms uses precipitation data from  s earth observing satellites and the   gpm  rainfall data from gpm is combined with a land surface model that incorporates vegetation cover soil type and terrain to determine how much water is soaking into the ground and how much water is flowing into  users can view statistics for rainfall streamflow water depth and flooding every 3 hours at each 12  gridpoint on a global map forecasts for these parameters are 5 days into the future users can zoom in to see inundation maps  areas estimated to be covered with water  in 1 kilometer resolution deadliest floods
