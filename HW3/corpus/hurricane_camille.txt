the origins of hurricane camille were from a  off the western coast of  on august5 1969 it tracked quickly westward along the  a tropical disturbance became clearly identifiable on satellite imagery on august9 by that time the thunderstorm activity concentrated into a circular area of  the next day it moved through the  although there was no evidence of a closed  on august13 the wave passed near or over the southern coast of  as its convection spread northeastward through the  subsequently it began a slower motion to the northwest it is believed that a tropical depression formed shortly thereafter early on august14 and it became a tropical storm a few hours later on the morning of august14 the  flew to investigate for a closed circulation near the bahamas as well as near the  the crew observed a developing center in the western caribbean and winds had reached tropical storm status by then the storm had strengthened into a strong tropical storm with winds of 60mph  95km h  about 50 miles  80km  west-northwest of  upon first being classified as a tropical storm camille was located in an area favorable for further strengthening although initially it slowly intensified it was located within an area of very light  and an overall warm environment additionally the storm developed strong  from the deep southern caribbean which continuously brought moisture into the storm throughout its duration it was a small tropical cyclone although with a radius of gale-force winds spreading 100 miles  160km  to the north the storm s thunderstorm area quickly spread over cuba as the storm approached the western coast of cuba it began  reaching hurricane status and less than 12hours later attained winds of 110mph  175km h  prior to  its  was tracked by  from   it is estimated the hurricane moved ashore between  and  late on august15 as a strong category 2 hurricane camille was a small hurricane as it crossed western cuba and its winds decreased slightly to 105mph  165km h  over land before it emerged into the gulf of mexico

initially hurricane camille was forecast to turn northeastward toward the  instead it continued northwestward and rapidly intensified once again almost immediately after leaving cuba its eye contracted to a diameter of less than 8 miles  13km  and strong  developed around the entire hurricane due to the small eye hurricane hunters at first had difficulties in obtaining the strength  however a flight late on august16 found a strong  on the  and recorded a very low pressure of 908   26.82  with winds estimated at 175mph  280km h  at the time it was not expected to intensify further however a subsequent hurricane hunters flight early on 17 august recorded a pressure of 905   26.73  at the time the  recorded by reconnaissance aircraft that made camille the most intense hurricane since the   currently it is the sixth most intense atlantic hurricane as ranked by lowest pressure at the same time maximum wind speeds in the hurricane peaked at 175mph  280km h  by 00  on august17 as it continued toward the  camille maintained its small eye and forecasters continued to anticipate a turn toward florida late on august17 camille briefly weakened to a category 4 storm due to an   a reconnaissance flight was forced to end its mission early due to a damaged engine before they left the storm the crew recorded a pressure of 919   27.14  and estimated surface winds at 155mph  250km h  while camille was located about 100 miles  160km  southeast of the  there were no subsequent hurricane hunter flights but surface observations recorded later suggested that camille quickly re-strengthened and regained category 5 intensity after passing very near southeastern louisiana hurricane camille made landfall early on august18 in  maximum wind speeds near the coastline were estimated to have been about 175mph  280km h  with a pressure of 900   26.58  the hurricane weakened as it progressed inland and within 14 hours of moving ashore camille weakened to tropical storm status about 12 hours later it weakened to tropical depression status by which time it began a turn to the north and northeast on august20 tropical depression camille turned eastward through kentucky dropping heavy rainfall in west virginia and virginia later that day it emerged into the atlantic ocean east of  and by that afternoon as it was emerging offshore it regained tropical storm status camille accelerated east-northeastward attaining peak winds of 70mph  110km h  as it interacted with larger  to its southeast  although the poor sampling of the region means that it is possible that the storm may have regained hurricane intensity in a location where measurements of wind speed were not taken  subsequently camille began to interact with a  causing it to gradually change into an  as it entrained cooler air on august22 camille was absorbed by the cold front to the south of  preparations 




national hurricane center track forecasts for camille from western cuba onward the system s actual track is marked by the line farthest to the west 

shortly after camille formed the national hurricane center advised residents on the  and in western cuba to prepare for gale-force winds heavy rains and rising tides the agency also recommended small boats to remain in harbor the threat of the storm prompted officials to evacuate thousands along the western coast of cuba and on the isle of pines  on the island 10,000cattle and 6,000turkeys were moved to safer areas as camille impacted cuba small craft were advised not to venture out too far from the coasts of florida on 15 august the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for a 110 miles  180km  stretch of land in florida between  and  the next day as these hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning thousands of people boarded up their homes and evacuated inland during the afternoon of 16 august the weather bureau ordered that a hurricane watch should be placed in force for the coastline from  to  florida later that day the hurricane watches were upgraded to a hurricane warning for the northwestern florida coast from fort walton to st marks 
by saturday morning a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from biloxi eastward civil defense organizations in coastal counties went on alert  and the naval construction battalion center prepared for the storm by 5 p.m on sunday a hurricane warning was issued for the coast this activated the  units many refused to believe the reports concerning camille s intensity that afternoon many people living at elevations of 20 feet  6.1m  above  refused to believe they were going to be submerged the mayor of  ordered the release of prisoners from the city jail as winds increased at 9 p.m on sunday evening but none would leave impact 

making landfall in  as a category5 hurricane camille caused damage and destruction across much of the  because it moved quickly through the region hurricane camille dropped only moderate precipitation in most areas areas in and around pass christian its point of landfall reported from 7 to 10 inches  180 to 250mm  the area of total destruction in  was 68 square miles  180km2  the total estimated cost of damage was  1.42billion  1969   9.27billion 2017usd  this made camille the second-most expensive hurricane in the united states up to that point  behind   the storm directly killed 143people along   and  an additional 153people perished as a result of catastrophic flooding in  and other areas nearby in all 8,931people were injured 5,662 homes were destroyed and 13,915 homes experienced major damage with many of the fatalities being coastal residents who had refused to evacuate caribbean and offshore gulf of mexico 
as a developing tropical storm camille brought rain showers to  although there were no reports of damage stations in cuba on the outer fringes of the storm reported winds of 50mph  80km h  east of where it moved ashore the city of guane recorded winds of 92mph  148km h  although no wind reports were taken in the landfall location the hurricane produced up to 10 inches  250mm  near guane as well as on the  on the isle of pines the storm inflicted damage to about 100houses throughout  camille caused heavy damage primarily from river flooding  about 20,000people were left homeless in the province strong winds downed trees and power lines which caused power outages eastward through the capital city of  initially the government reported no casualties from the storm subsequent research indicated the hurricane killed five people in the country during its passage and damage was estimated at  5million  1969  in the days after the storm struck cuba the government deployed medical teams to affected regions to provide  vaccine shots officials noted the potential for the spread of disease due to flooding from camille as well as previously wet conditions in the open  the hurricane produced  of at least 70 feet  21m  as measured by  along the ocean floor the storm created mudslides which lowered the ocean floor  its combination with strong waves and winds destroyed three oil platforms including one that at the time was the deepest oil well property damages to the offshore oil industry were initially estimated at  100million  1969usd  louisiana

richelieu apartments before camille






richelieu apartments after camille


one persistent account about camille states that 23 people held a   on the third floor of the richelieu manor apartments in  in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall the high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building killing all but one person who the survivor is how many party guests there were and just how far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling an  made-for-tv movie called hurricane starring  of      and  was loosely based on the supposed hurricane party however the site and names were changed to fictitious ones for the movie as was the name of the hurricane the television show  carried an episode regarding the parties of hurricane camille and the actual hurricane itself twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the richelieu apartments during the hurricane eight of whom died the tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor mary ann gerlach survivor ben duckworth has expressed irritation at the story there was no hurricane party duckworth reiterated in 2001 we were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars we were too tired to party i cant tell you why that story persists or why people didn t put two and two together i guess the hurricane party makes a good story the site of the richelieu apartments the corner of henderson avenue and us 90 in pass christian later became a shopping center coincidentally it was destroyed by  alabama and florida 
alabama also experienced damage along u.s highway 90  26,000 homes and over 1,000 businesses were wiped out completely across the state of alabama camille s large circulation also resulted in a 3-to-5-foot  0.91 to 1.52m  storm surge in  the highest rainfall report received within alabama was 6.52 inches  166mm  two miles northeast of  camille caused about  8 million  1969 dollars  of damage in alabama places farther east across the western  saw lesser rains as 4.16 inches  106mm  was measured at  ohio valley and west virginia 




camille storm total rainfall


camille caused moderate rainfall in  and  of between 3 and 5 inches  130mm  helping to relieve a drought in the area yet in  there was flash flooding which destroyed 36 houses and 12 trailers a total of three quarters of a million dollars in damage virginia 
because the hurricane was expected to quickly dissipate over land few were prepared for the flash flooding arriving in  on the evening of august19 camille was no longer a hurricane but it carried high amounts of moisture and contained sufficient strength and low pressure to pull in additional moisture a widespread area of western and central virginia received over 8 inches  200mm  of rain from camille s remains leading to significant flooding across the state a total of 153 people lost their lives from  sustained during mountain slides related to the flash flooding not drowning more than 123 of these deaths including 21 members of one family the huffmans were in nelson county debris  occurred on hillsides with a slope greater than 35percent in nelson county the number of deaths amounted to over one percent of the county s population the worst of the damage was reported in          and along the davis and muddy creeks the james and tye rivers crested well above flood stage in many areas including a record high of 41.3 feet  12.6m  at  hurricane camille caused more than  140 million of damage  1969 dollars  in virginia camille was considered one of the worst  in central virginia s recorded history

the storm dropped torrential rainfall of 12 to 20 inches  300 to 510mm  with a maximum of 27 inches  690mm  most of the rainfall occurred in virginia during a 3-5hour period on 1920 august five  5  plus inches of rain fell near the north fork of the tye river in only half an hour with the grounds already saturated from previous rains many rivers flooded across the state with the worst being the  in  with a peak crest of 28.6 feet  8.7m  many rivers in virginia and west virginia set records for peak flood stages causing numerous mudslides along mountainsides in the mountain slopes between  and  more than 26 inches  660mm  of rain fell in 12 hours but the worst was in  where 27 inches  690mm  fell there rainfall was so heavy that reports were received of birds drowning in trees cows floating down the hatt creek and of survivors having to cup hands around their mouth and nose in order to breathe through the deluge though the official rainfall was recorded as 27 inches unofficial estimates are much greater some estimate that more than 40 inches of rain fell at davis creek most gauges were washed away  however it was reported that an empty 55 gallon drum that was not even in the center of the heaviest rainfall had 31 inches of water in it after camille passed  so much rain fell in such a short time in nelson county that according to the national weather service at the time it was  the probable maximum rainfall which meteorologists compute to be theoretically possible    
the ensuing flash floods and mudslides killed 153people in nelson county alone 133 bridges washed out while in some places entire communities were under water the major flooding that occurred downstream cut off all communication between richmond and the   on the  saw eight feet of water downtown and  had more than five feet throughout virginia camille destroyed 313 houses 71 trailers and 430 farm buildings 3,765 families were affected by the hurricane in the area and total damage in the state amounted to  140.8million  1969usd  747million 2005usd  records 

camille produced the sixth lowest official  ever recorded in the atlantic basin at 900 millibars  27inhg  this was also its landfalling pressure  the only hurricane to hit the united states with a lower pressure at landfall was the  a reconnaissance flight indicated a pressure of 901 millibars  26.6inhg  but this pressure was later corrected in 1969 by researchers to 919mb  27.14inhg  the wind speed of camille can only be approximated as no meteorological equipment survived the extreme conditions at landfall but camille is estimated to have had sustained winds of 190mph  305km h  at landfall with gusts exceeding 230mph  370km h  although a reanalysis in april 2014 concluded that camille had maximum winds of 175mph  280km h  rather than the 190 beforehand before  in 2005 camille likely had the highest  measured in the united states at over 24 feet  7.3m  the 24-foot  7.3m  storm surge quoted by the army corps of engineers was based on high-water marks inside surviving buildings of which there were but three prior to the collapse of the richelieu apartments ben duckworth shone a flashlight down a stairwell and found the water within one step of the third-story floor  this establishes a surge height of 28 feet  8.5m  at that spot at that time about 15minutes later the building collapsed and the evidence vanished with it in addition camille forced the  to flow backwards for a river-distance of 125miles  from its mouth to a point north of   the river further backed up for an additional 120 miles  190km  to a point north of  in 1969 the naming conventions for hurricanes were not strictly controlled as they are today there were only three requirements  the name had to be female  male names were not used at that time  the names had to remain in alphabetical order and the name could not have been retired

although hurricane camille and  took different paths they both reached the same section of the coast of mississippi with similar destructive effects camille intensified more rapidly than katrina and unlike katrina camille re-intensified a second time and maintained status as a category 5 hurricane until landfall both hurricanes shared the common aspect of undergoing periods of rapid intensification the size of camille s  was less than one-third that of katrina more similar to the intense but small  also unlike katrina camille caused little damage in  though camille itself just barely missed the city the area of hurricane-force winds within camille was just over two-thirds the size of hurricane katrina both storms were moving at a similar forward motion at the time of landfall although camille s wind speed at landfall was higher katrina s storm surge exceeded camille s storm surge at all known locations due to its greater size both hurricanes  names were retired due to the time period between the two hurricanes along with the approximate same landfall locations sizes and intensities of the two storms katrina had been nicknamed  camille s deadly daughter
