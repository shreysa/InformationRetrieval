a degree  in full a degree of arc arc degree or arcdegree  usually denoted by   the   is a measurement of a   defined so that a  is 360 degrees it is not an  as the si unit of angular measure is the  but it is mentioned in the si brochure as an  because a full rotation equals 2 radians one degree is equivalent to  180 radians

a circle with an equilateral   red  one sixtieth of this arc is a degree six such chords complete the circle 

the original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown one theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year ancient  noticed that the sun which follows through the  path over the course of the year seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day some ancient  such as the  used 360 days for a year the use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of  numbers another theory is that the babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an  as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their  numeric system the  used by the  and their  successors was based on  of a circle a chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity one sixtieth of this using their standard  divisions was a degree  and  seem to have been among the first  to exploit babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically  aristarchus   and hipparchus were the first greeks known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60   used a simpler  system dividing a circle into 60 parts the division of the circle into 360 parts also occurred in ancient  as evidenced in the

another motivation for choosing the number 360 may have been that it is   360 has 24  making it one of only 7 numbers such that no number less than twice as much has more divisors  sequence  in the   furthermore it is divisible by every number from 1 to 10 except 7 this property has many useful applications such as dividing the world into 24  each of which is nominally 15 of  to correlate with the established   convention finally it may be the case that more than one of these factors has come into play according to that theory the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above subdivisions 
for many practical purposes a degree is a small enough angle that whole degrees provide sufficient precision when this is not the case as in  or for    and   degree measurements may be written using  with the degree symbol behind the decimals  for example 40.1875 alternatively the traditional   subdivisions can be used one degree is divided into 60 minutes  of arc  and one minute into 60 seconds  of arc  use of degrees-minutes-seconds is also called dms notation these subdivisions also called the  and  are respectively represented by a single and double  for example 40.1875   40 11 15 or using  characters 40 11  15  additional precision can be provided using decimals for the arcseconds component the older system of   etc which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision was used by  and other ancient astronomers but is rarely used today these subdivisions were denoted  by writing the  for the number of sixtieths in superscript  1i for a    minute of arc  1ii for a  1iii for a  1iv for a  etc hence the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc and the word  second  also refer to this system see also  




a chart to convert between degrees and radians


in most  work beyond practical geometry angles are typically measured in  rather than degrees this is for a variety of reasons  for example the  have simpler and more  natural  properties when their arguments are expressed in radians these considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360 one complete   360  is equal to 2 radians so 180 is equal to  radians or equivalently the degree is a   1   180 the   or revolution full circle full rotation cycle  is used in technology and science one turn is equal to 360 with the invention of the  based on powers of ten there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal  degrees  called  or  where the number in a right angle is equal to 100gon with 400gon in a full circle  1   109 gon  although that idea was abandoned by napoleon grades continued to be used in several fields and many  support them decigrades  14,000  were used with french artillery sights in world war i an  which is most used in military applications has at least three specific variants ranging from 16,400 to 16,000 it is approximately equal to one milliradian  c 16,283  a mil measuring 16,000 of a revolution originated in the imperial russian army where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units this may be seen on a lining plane  an early device for aiming  artillery  dating from about 1900 in the  museum of artillery
