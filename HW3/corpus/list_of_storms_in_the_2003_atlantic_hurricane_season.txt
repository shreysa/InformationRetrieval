seasonal forecasts 

pre-season outlook 
on may 19 prior to the start of the season  forecasters issued a 55%probability of above normal activity the forecasters predicted 1115 tropical storms 69 of those becoming hurricanes and 24 of those hurricanes reaching at least category3 strength on the  the above normal activity predicted was due to the likelihood of  developing in the season noted hurricane expert dr  on april 4 predicted twelve named storms with eight reaching hurricane strength and three of the eight reaching category3 strength the prediction issued on may 30 was similar increasing the named storms to fourteen the synoptic pattern of the season prior to june 1 resembled other previous seasons with the     and  seasons considered the best analogs for the season the prediction also included a 68%probability for a hurricane landfall along the united states mid-season outlook 
on august 6 dr gray announced he had maintained his previous prediction  with an active start of the season the rest of the season was forecast to have been only slightly above average due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the atlantic ocean a day later noaa released an updated prediction as well with a 60 probability of above normal activity with 1215 named storms 79 hurricanes and 34 major hurricanes expected a normal season as defined by noaa has 614tropical storms 48of which reach hurricane strength and 13of those reaching category3 strength season summary

the official beginning of the season was on june 1 2003 though  formed on april 20 well before the start to the season starting at the official start of the season the  began issuing five-day forecasts extending from the three-day forecasts issued since 1964 officials conducted tests during the previous two seasons indicating the new five-day forecasts would be as accurate as the three-day forecasts were 15years earlier the tropics were active and well ahead of climatology in the early portion of the season with the seventh tropical depression forming by the end of july the season officially ended on november 30 2003 although tropical storms  and peter developed in early december the season is one of only six with a storm before and after the official bounds of the season  the others are     and  when tropical storm peter formed on december 7 the season became the second on record with two december storms the 235days between the development of the first storm  and the dissipation of the last storm peter made the 2003 season the longest season since  the season was the eighth most active on record behind the        and  seasons and tied with the  and  seasons no cyclones in the season had a significant impact on south america or central america however a total of eight tropical cyclones made  on mexico from either the atlantic or the pacific ocean which was the greatest total since the record of nine in  a total of seven deaths occurred in mexico from atlantic hurricanes much of the  did not receive significant impact from tropical cyclones during the season 



damage from hurricane fabian on bermuda


six tropical cyclones made landfall along the coast of the united states during the season including two hurricanes the first  caused locally heavy damage in southeastern texas in july  two deaths were reported in the state while earlier in its duration it caused an indirect death from rough waves in florida in september  caused deaths and damage from north carolina through southern canada the worst damage from the hurricane occurred in virginia where it was the costliest disaster in the history of the state  there damage totaled  1.85billion  2003usd  2.41billion 2017usd  and there were 32fatalities ten of which were caused directly by the hurricane hurricane isabel caused deaths in seven states and one canadian province and about 6million people were left without power as a result of the storm several cyclones impacted  during the season most significantly  on the island its passage proved to be the costliest and resulted in the first death since a hurricane in  the hurricane killed four on the island when its strong waves and storm surge washed two cars off  between  and  damage from the hurricane totaled  300million  2003usd  391million 2017usd  elsewhere  was considered among the most damaging in the history of  nova scotia where strong winds downed thousands of trees and left low-lying areas flooded from a record storm surge to the city the hurricane caused a total of eight deaths and damage estimated at  200million  2003  150million 2003usd  195million 2017usd  systems

hurricane danny 

a  moved off the coast of africa on july 9 the northern portion of the wave tracked to the west-northwest and on july 13 an area of convection developed along the wave axis the system slowly organized and after a closed low-level circulation developed the system was classified as tropical depression five about 630mi  1020km  east of  it quickly organized becoming tropical storm danny a day after forming tracking around the periphery of an  the storm moved northwestward before turning north and later northeastward despite being located at a high latitude danny continued to strengthen due to unusually warm water temperatures and on july 19 it attained hurricane status about 525mi  850km  south of  despite having an unusually high minimum pressure for a storm of its intensity  increased the next day as the hurricane turned eastward causing a steady weakening trend that was accelerated after crossing into an area of cooler water temperatures by july 20 the cyclone had turned to the southeast and weakened to tropical depression status and on july 21 it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area the remnants of danny tracked erratically southwestward before dissipating on july 27 about 630mi  1015km  east of where it originally developed there were no reports of damages or casualties associated with danny 
tropical depression six 

a  moved westward off the coast of africa on july 14 after tracking steadily westward an area of thunderstorms became more concentrated as its upper-level environment became more favorable and late on july 19 the national hurricane center classified it as tropical depression six while it was located about 1035mi  1675km  east of the  upon being classified as a tropical cyclone the depression maintained two ill-defined  to its north and south and was originally forecast to attain hurricane status before passing through the lesser antilles with warm waters and very light wind shear forecast its environmental conditions met four out of five parameters for  subsequently convection diminished as the result of cold air  and instability from a disturbance to its southeast with a fast forward speed confirmation of a low-level circulation on july 20 became difficult convection increased in curvature on july 21 and several islands in the lesser antilles issued  after it passed north of  a  flight failed to report a closed low-level circulation and it is estimated the depression degenerated into an open tropical wave late on july 21 the remnants brought a few showers to the lesser antilles and after tracking into the  redevelopment was prevented by increased wind shear the northern portion of the wave axis split and developed into tropical depression seven 
tropical depression seven 

a tropical wave interacted with an upper-level low to develop an area of deep convection near  on july 23 a mid to lower-level circulation developed within the system at it tracked generally north-northwestward and based on surface and satellite observations it is estimated the system developed into tropical depression seven at 1200 on july 25 about 60mi  95km  east of  florida the system was embedded in an environment characterized by high surface pressures tracking through an area of cool water temperatures as well as unfavorable upper-level winds the depression failed to achieve winds greater than 35mph  55km h  early on july 26 it moved ashore on   and after steadily weakening over land it dissipated on july 27 as the storm was never forecast to attain tropical storm status no  were issued however flood watches were posted for much of georgia and  the depression dropped light to moderate rainfall from florida to the coast of  peaking at 5.17in  131mm  in   mostly rainfall totals between 1 and 3 inches  25 and 76mm  were common there were no reports of damage or casualties associated with this depression 
hurricane erika 

main article  
the precursor system to hurricane erika was first observed as a non-tropical low on august 9 about 1150mi  1860km  east of bermuda it tracked quickly southwestward then westward in tandem with an upper-level low which prevented tropical development on august 13 an area of convection increased as it passed through the  and while crossing florida a circulation built toward the surface  it is estimated the system developed into tropical storm erika on august 14 about 85mi  140km  west-southwest of  florida a strong  caused the storm to continue quickly westward and the system gradually strengthened and organized by august 15 its forward motion slowed allowing the convection to organize into curved  and late in the day an  began developing tropical storm erika attained hurricane status at around 1030 as it was moving ashore in northeastern tamaulipas  operationally it was not classified as a hurricane due to lack of data the winds rapidly decreased as it tracked across the mountainous terrain of northeastern  and early on august 17 the cyclone dissipated the hurricane dropped light to moderate rainfall along its path which caused some flooding  in  in  two people died after being swept away by floodwaters several mudslides were reported which left numerous highways blocked or impassable in southern texas the hurricane caused light winds and minor damage with no reports of deaths or injuries in the united states 
tropical depression nine 

main article
