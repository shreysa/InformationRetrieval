this is a list of notable pacific hurricanes subdivided by reason for  notability means that it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic or is part of a top ten for some superlative it includes lists and rankings of  by different characteristics and impacts characteristics include extremes of location such as the northernmost or most equator-ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone other characteristics include its central pressure windspeed category on the   outside of a normal  timeframe or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960 another characteristic is how long a system went from formation to dissipation these include the cost of damage the number of casualties as well as meteorological statistics such as  point maxima

naming history 




 the eighth system to receive a central pacific name in 2015


naming of tropical cyclones in the eastern north pacific began in the  that year four lists of names were created the plan was to proceed in a manner similar to that of the western pacific  that is the name of the first storm in one season would be the next unused one from the same list and when the bottom of one list was reached the next list was started this scheme was abandoned in 1965 and next year the lists started being recycled on a four-year rotation starting with the a name each year that same general scheme remains in use today although the names and lists are different on average the eastern north pacific sees about sixteen named storms per year named storms per month

 the longest lasting pacific hurricane east of the international dateline


this lists all pacific hurricanes that existed as tropical cyclones while in the pacific ocean east of  for more than two weeks continuously hurricanes john and dora spent some time in the west pacific before dissipating john spent eleven days west of the dateline  if that time was included john would have existed for a total of 30days and 18hours a world record while including dora s time in the west pacific would mean that it existed for 18 days one atlantic hurricane  crossed into this basin and was renamed miriam giving it a total lifespan of 22days but not all of that was in the pacific 1993 s greg formed from the remnants of  its time as an atlantic system is excluded all of these systems except trudy olaf and connie existed in both the east and central pacific and all except olaf were hurricanes hurricane trudy of 1990 is thus the longest lived eastern pacific hurricane to stay in the eastern pacific tropical storm olaf of 1997 is hence the longest-lived eastern pacific tropical cyclone not to reach hurricane intensity no known tropical cyclone forming in the central north pacific lasted for longer than 14days without crossing into  the tropical cyclone forming in the central pacific that spent the most time there was  at 12.75days from formation to extratropical transition 
before the  era began the lifespans of many pacific hurricanes may be underestimated crossover storms

tracks of atlantic-pacific crossovers on both directions


this includes only systems which stayed a tropical cyclone during the passage or that maintained a circulation during the crossover 
it used to be that when a pacific named storm crossed north america and made it to the atlantic  or vice versa  it would receive the next name on the respective basin s list however in 2000 this policy was changed so that a tropical cyclone will keep its name if it remains a tropical cyclone during the entire passage only if it dissipates and then re-forms does it get renamed from eastern pacific to atlantic

this includes only systems which stayed a tropical cyclone during the passage or that maintained a circulation during the crossover 
in addition to those there are apparently two additional ones one existed before 1856 and made it to the  another pacific tropical cyclone crossed over central mexico and also made it to the gulf sometime after september 9 1924 from eastern pacific to western pacific 




2014 s  existed in all three north pacific tropical cyclone basins


neither eastern pacific tropical cyclones passing 140w nor central pacific tropical cyclones crossing the dateline are notable events however very few eastern pacific proper cyclones that enter the central pacific make it to the dateline 
 system ceased to be a tropical cyclone before crossing the dateline and subsequently reforming  hurricane li formed in the eastern pacific but was not named until it crossed into the central pacific in addition  of  is recognized per   and  as a storm that existed in all three areas of responsibility but isn t recognized by the  as a official western pacific tropical cyclone from western pacific to central pacific 




1994 s  crossed the dateline twice from the central to the western pacific and back


tropical cyclones crossing from the western pacific to the central pacific are fairly rare and this has happened only seven times before of those seven times five of them were storms which crossed the dateline twice  from the western to the central pacific and back  or vice versa  no tropical cyclone from the western pacific has ever made it past 140w 
 system crossed the dateline twice   hurricane typhoon john formed in the eastern pacific in addition  of  and  of  are recognized per  as basin-crossing storms but aren t recognized as such by the  also  of  may have achieved this feat as well however it isn t recognized as an official western pacific tropical cyclone by either the  or the  from central pacific to eastern pacific 




2016 s  crossed 140w thrice moving from the eastern to the central pacific twice


tropical cyclones crossing from the eastern pacific to the central pacific are routine  ones going the other way are not that event has happened thrice 
 system crossed 140w more than once it was previously believed that an  of  crossed 140w and is still included in the  as such but according to a reanalysis made by the  the storm became extratropical before doing so in addition an  formed on october 30 2006 in the central pacific subtropics it eventually developed an  structure its track data indicates that it crossed from the central to the east pacific because it formed at longitude 149w and dissipated at 135w  which is not a meteorological organization called this system a  and the naval research laboratory monterey had enough interest in it to call it 91c the system has also been called  this cyclone is unofficial because it is not included in the seasonal reports of either  intensity records




 the most intense pacific hurricane on record


per lowest central pressure 
the apparent increase in recent seasons is spurious  it is due to better estimation and measurement not an increase in intense storms that is until 1988 pacific hurricanes generally did not have their central pressures measured or estimated from satellite imagery

per highest sustained winds
intensity is measured solely by central pressure unless the pressure is not known in which case intensity is measured by maximum sustained winds 
 this tropical cyclone is the strongest to form in its month by virtue of its being the only known system unusual landfall locations
