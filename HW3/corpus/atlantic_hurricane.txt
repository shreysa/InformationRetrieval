decrease in wind shear from july to august contributes to a significant increase of tropical activity an average of 2.8 atlantic tropical storms develop annually in august on average four named tropical storms including one hurricane occur by august 30 and the first intense hurricane develops by 4 september 
september 




typical locations and tracks in september


the peak of the hurricane season occurs in september and corresponds with low  and the warmest  the month of september sees an average of 3 storms a year by 24 september the average atlantic season features 7 named tropical storms including 4 hurricanes in addition two major hurricanes occur on average by 28 september relatively few tropical cyclones make landfall at these intensities 
october

the favorable conditions found during september begin to decay in october the main reason for the decrease in activity is increasing  although  are also cooler than in september activity falls markedly with 1.8 cyclones developing on average despite a climatological secondary peak around 20 october by 21 october the average season features 9 named storms with 5 hurricanes a third major hurricane occurs after 28 september in half of all atlantic tropical cyclone seasons in contrast to mid-season activity the mean locus of formation shifts westward to the caribbean and gulf of mexico reversing the eastward progression of june through august 
november

atlantic multidecadal oscillation timeseries 18562013


while the number of storms in the atlantic has increased since 1995 there is no obvious global trend the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 8710 however the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins primarily in the southern hemisphere in spite of that there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing in 2006  stated  records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes the energy released by the average hurricane  again considering all hurricanes worldwide  seems to have increased by around 70 in the past 30years or so corresponding to about a 15 increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60 increase in storm lifetime  at the time emanuel theorized that increased heat from global warming was driving this trend however some argue that emanuel s own research in 2008 refuted this theory others contend that the trend does not exist at all but instead is a figment created by faulty readings from primitive 1970s-era measurement equipment  vecchi and knutson  2008  found a weakly positive although not statistically-significant trend in the number of north atlantic tropical cyclones for 18782006 but also a surprisingly strong decrease in cyclone duration over this period on may 15 2014 the journal  published a peer-reviewed submission from october 2013 by james p kossin kerry a emanuel and gabriel a vecchi that suggests that a poleward migration exists for the paths of maximum intensity of tropical cyclone activity in the atlantic the focus of the report is on the latitude at which recent tropical cyclones in the atlantic are reaching maximum intensity their data indicates that during the past thirty years the peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres at a rate of approximately 60km per decade amounting to approximately one degree of latitude per decade atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially since five of the ten  have occurred since 1990 according to the  recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions pielke et al  2008  normalized mainland u.s hurricane damage from 19002005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage the 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades the decade 19962005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades with only the decade 19261935 surpassing its costs the most damaging single storm is the  with  157billion of normalized damage often in part because of the threat of hurricanes many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism  therefore the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances the combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes therefore experts regard the early data as suspect  et al estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 these undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones the density of shipping tracks over the atlantic basin and the amount of populated coastline the number and strength of atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 5070year cycle also known as the  nyberg et al reconstructed atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early eighteenth century and found five periods averaging 35 major hurricanes per year and lasting 4060years and six other averaging 1.52.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 1020years these periods are associated with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation throughout a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing dampening the number of major hurricanes by 12 per year although more uncommon since 1995 few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 197094 destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 192660 including many major new england hurricanes twenty-one atlantic tropical storms formed in  a record only recently exceeded in  which saw 28 storms tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 190025  however many intense storms formed during 187099 during the  19 tropical storms formed of which a record 4 occurred after november 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s  however many struck in the early 19th century including an  that made a direct hit on  some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as  in strength these active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the atlantic basin before the satellite era began in 1960 tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one a ship reported a voyage through the storm or a storm landed in a populated area the official record therefore could miss storms in which no ship experienced gale-force winds recognized it as a tropical storm  as opposed to a high-latitude extra-tropical cyclone a tropical wave or a brief squall  returned to port and reported the experience proxy records based on  research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the  coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia few major hurricanes struck the gulf coast during 30001400 bc and again during the most recent millennium these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 bc and 1000 ad when the gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 35 times this millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the  which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the  according to the azores high hypothesis an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the gulf of mexico coast and the atlantic coast during the quiescent periods a more northeasterly position of the azores high would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the atlantic coast during the hyperactive period more hurricanes were steered towards the gulf coast as the azores high was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the caribbean such a displacement of the azores high is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in  around 3200  bp and a change towards more humid conditions in the  during the late-holocene as more moisture was pumped up the  through the gulf coast preliminary data from the northern atlantic coast seem to support the azores high hypothesis a 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in  suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 5001000years just as the gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium see also
