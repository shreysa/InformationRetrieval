a hypercane is a  class of extreme  that could form if ocean temperatures reached 50c  122f  which is 15c  27f  warmer than the warmest ocean temperature ever recorded such an increase could be caused by a large  or  impact a large  eruption or extensive  there is some speculation that a series of hypercanes resulting from an  by a large  contributed to the  of the non-avian  the hypothesis was created by  of  who also coined the term

in order to form a hypercane according to emanuel s hypothetical model the ocean temperature would have to be at least 49c  120f  a critical difference between a hypercane and present-day hurricanes is that a hypercane would extend into the upper  whereas present-day hurricanes extend into only the lower stratosphere hypercanes would have wind speeds of over 800km h  500mph  and would also have a central pressure of less than 70   21   700 millibars  giving them an enormous lifespan for comparison the largest and most intense storm on record was 1979 s  with a wind speed of 305 kilometres per hour  190mph  and central pressure of 87   26   870 millibars  such a storm would be eight times more powerful than the strongest storms yet recorded the extreme conditions needed to create a hypercane could conceivably produce a system up to the size of  creating  of 18m  59ft  and an eye nearly 300km  190mi  across  the waters could remain hot enough for weeks allowing more hypercanes to be formed a hypercane s clouds would reach 30km  19mi  to 40km  25mi  into the  such an intense storm would also damage the earth s  water molecules in the stratosphere would react with  to accelerate decay into o2 and reduce absorption of  a hurricane functions as a  powered by the temperature difference between the sea and the uppermost layer of the troposphere as air is drawn in towards the eye it acquires  from evaporating sea-water which is then released as  during the rise inside the eyewall and radiated away at the top of the storm system the energy input is balanced by energy dissipation in a turbulent  close to the surface which leads to an energy balance equilibrium 
however in emanuel s model if the temperature difference between the sea and the top of the troposphere is too large there is no solution to the equilibrium equation as more air is drawn in the released heat reduces the central pressure further the lower the pressure the more heat is drawn in leading to a runaway process the actual limit to hypercane intensity depends on other energy dissipation factors that are uncertain  whether inflow ceases to be  whether  would form in the outflow around the eye or whether turbulent breakdown of the vortex happens see also
