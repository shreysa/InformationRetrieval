hurricane edna originated in an easterly  which modern research has estimated to have spawned a tropical depression east of the  on september 2 1954 the  was not observed in real time until several days later on september 5 while situated between  and  near the disturbance a ship reported heavy squalls and wind gusts to 70mph  110km h  additionally the island of puerto rico experienced torrential rainfall in association with the storm operationally the system was not recognized to have organized into a tropical cyclone until september 6  it is listed in the  as achieving tropical storm intensity early on september 4 edna proceeded west-northwestward bypassing  to the north and by september 7 it had strengthened into a minimal hurricane on the present-day  initially a rather small storm in terms of physical size the hurricane steadily intensified throughout the day  aircraft flew into the storm frequently to take observations on the cyclone s structure the center of circulation passed near  and on september 8 edna further strengthened into a category 3 major hurricane while broadly curving northward reconnaissance flights indicated a maturing and evolving  approximately 20mi  32km  in diameter the overall circulation increased in size as banding features became more well-defined the storm reached its peak winds of 120mph  190km h  and maintained them for over two days however reconnaissance data was at times inconsistent and inaccurate leading to suspicious and unlikely jogs in the storm s track the cause of these errors is attributed to misinterpretation of  information midday on september 9 while tracking nearly due north edna s minimum central  fell to 968  28.6  but is believed to have leveled off shortly thereafter the radius of hurricane-force winds increased and the storm may have become asymmetrical with convection concentrated to the right of the center although this was not confirmed due to a lack of data an approaching weak  spread overcast conditions over the  north of  by september 10 edna was located just south of  passing east of the  early the next day as the hurricane accelerated to the northeast it began to deteriorate and weaken closely following the recent track of  edna approached  but diverged from carol s track upon skirting the eastern coast instead of moving inland weather reporting stations in the  reported rapid clearing as the storm gained latitude while heavy rain and gusty winds enveloped new england on september 11 edna passed directly over  after weakening to category 2 status although  depicted a central pressure of 950mbar  28inhg  it subsequently tracked just east of  the storm continued northeastward into  and transitioned into an  although the exact time of this transition is unknown the storm s extratropical remnants reemerged into the northern atlantic after crossing eastern canada and were last noted on september15 preparations 
in advance of the storm  were issued for parts of the bahamas and  as winds of up to hurricane force were expected farther to the north storm warnings were posted from  to eastport maine along the coast of north carolina and the  where gale-force winds and high tides were expected residents were advised to take precautions in  it was to be considered  a miracle  if edna did not strike the area directly and the storm was predicted to be one of the most severe hurricanes in the history of the new york  in the 24hours before the storm struck  received 361,392calls which was the third highest volume the company ever recorded in the  area 500 residents evacuated their homes by early september 11 while all businesses closed in  businesses in  which was flooded during hurricane carol prepared sandbags to mitigate flooding most beach homes had closed for the summer season and hundreds of people who lived along the southern new england coast evacuated other threatened areas were evacuated including  where 3,000 families left their homes sirens alerted other residents to remain indoors and drivers to stay off the highways along the coast of connecticut bus and train service was halted a state of emergency was declared in  and mail service was canceled in some areas on september 10 the navy ordered the evacuation of hundreds of warships and aircraft  planes evacuated from rhode island and massachusetts about 40 shelters which were opened during hurricane carol 11days prior were reopened to provide food officers at  sent 40trucks with cots blankets and generators to areas expected to be struck by the storm advance warning was credited with a lower death toll in edna than carol impact

on september 7 a bulletin from  reported extensive flood-inducing rainfall along the western and southern coasts of the island over 10in  250mm  of precipitation fell within a two-day period the easternmost islands of the bahamas including san salvador experienced gale-force winds and high seas united states 
edna s path near north carolina was about 50mi  80km  east of carol winds blew at up to 70mph  110km h  along the shore accompanied by strong surf although no fatalities or major property damage resulted from the storm tides at  were only slightly above normal during the storm s passage to the east and winds were moderate in strength peripheral rainfall in maryland and delaware eased drought conditions in coastal  northwesterly winds reached 65mph  105km h  and  received around 4in  100mm  of rainfall further north  also suffered moderate to strong winds blowing from the north at their peak a  station in  recorded 45mph  72km h  winds midday on september 11 rainfall reached 4.98in  126mm  in the city becoming the wettest day in 45years the storm cut off  on eastern long island at its height prompting the  to temporarily relocate 500 families rainfall in  amounted to 9in  230mm  crop damage in new york was estimated at  1.5million and six people died in the city due to highway deaths when edna struck new england it was moving quickly to the northeast at 45mph  72km h  it struck eastern massachusetts about 100mi  160km  east of where hurricane carol struck only a week prior hurricane-force winds affected much of the coastline with peak gusts of 120mph  190km h  on  offshore massachusetts and 110mph  180km h  on  offshore rhode island along the coast wind gusts peaked at 100mph  160km h  at  the high winds caused widespread power outages including for nearly all of  the  reached 6ft  1.8m  along the massachusetts coast causing flooding and heavy boating damage further west there was lesser coastal flooding although heavy rainfall after previously wet conditions caused urban and stream flooding  rainfall peaked at around 11in  280mm  damage in connecticut and rhode island was mainly in areas already affected by hurricane carol several streets were washed out and rivers rose above flood stage damage was heaviest in maine estimated at  25million which made edna the costliest hurricane in the state s history strong wind gusts reaching 74mph  119km h  and heavy rainfall peaking at 7.49in  190mm  extended into the state  these were considered the heaviest rains in the state in 58years the  and  rivers both reached above-normal levels causing flooding and washing out roads in  the kennebec river reached 20.5ft  6.2m  which was 5ft  1.5m  above the peak level after the spring snow melt flooding entered basements affected fields and covered bridges in  the floods washed out a bridge that was under construction in addition the winds downed trees which blocked widespread roads and caused power outages in 18 of the state washed out roads and rail lines cut off the state from the rest of new england in  a trapped car in 5ft  1.5m  deep waters required rescue by boat another stranded family was rescued after seven hours in  in which one child and a rescuer were killed there were eight deaths in the state most of whom related to cars being swept away by floods there were 21deaths in new england including eight drownings in maine throughout the united states damage was estimated at  42,815,000 damage was less from edna than from carol primarily due to its strongest winds not occurring at the time of highest tides and its track farther to the east throughout new england 260,000people lost power most of whom in massachusetts atlantic canada 
while rapidly losing characteristics of a tropical cyclone edna traversed central  in contrast with the smaller more compact  which struck atlantic canada in 2003 edna was a much larger storm with strong winds extending hundreds of miles from the center the tightest pressure gradient was focused on the east side of the storm over mainland  edna brought down approximately 700 million board feet of timber and although the amount of trees the storm destroyed was comparable to that of juan its effects were more widespread and not as locally severe sustained winds reached 160km h  99mph  at  and 95km h  59mph  at  the intense winds downed power and telephone lines and destroyed many barns  one such structural collapse killed a man and livestock were lost throughout the region other damage to property included several fallen chimneys a toppled church steeple in  and roof failures in  an apartment building undergoing construction was destroyed approximately  3 million  in apple crops were decimated while in yarmouth both live lobsters and lobster pots were lost debris blocked streets across the province and at least 800m  0.50mi  of road was washed out damage in nova scotia totaled  6 million cad  in the aftermath yarmouth and kentville declared states of emergency in new brunswick the storm dropped 130mm  5.1in  of rain and produced winds of 120km h  75mph  wind damage was less significant than in nova scotia although still evident in structures and utility lines a theatre in  was destroyed and several people were injured across the area the storm flooded streets in  about 400 salmon valued at  10,000 cad were lost in  total damage in the province is estimated at  1.78 million cad elsewhere power outages were reported in  aftermath 
in maine  were declared states of emergency after the storm  sent a crew of 100workers in 50trucks to maine to assist in restoring power power was quickly restored and in some places the outages were less severe than during carol for only the third time in its history the  was not delivered due to the storm most primary roads were re-opened by two days after the storm although rural areas and rail lines took longer to repair there was a temporary travel ban for all but emergency vehicles in maine due to washed out roads affecting densely populated portions of the state edna struck the day before the  between   and   before the election politicians commented how a suppressed turnout as a result of the storm would benefit muskie in a state where no democrat had won governorship since 1934 muskie ultimately won the election in a close race which saw a lower turnout than  likely due to edna suppressing the rural republican turnout after a survey from the  described damage as  tremendous    declared portions of maine as a disaster area which allocated federal funding for relief the president also authorized additional aid to rhode island and massachusetts due to additional damage there from edna due to the severity of the storm the name edna was  after this usage for ten years before it was reintroduced for the  at the 1969 interdepartmental hurricane conference it was proposed that the names edna carol and hazel be permanently retired because of their importance to the research community despite the proposal the name edna was added to the 1972 naming list but was ultimately unused see also
