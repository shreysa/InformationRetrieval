implementing clenshaw-curtis quadrature i methodology and experience clenshaw-curtis quadrature is a particularly important automatic quadrature scheme for a variety of reasons especially the high accuracy obtained from relatively few integrand values However, it has received little use because it requires the computation of a cosine transformation and the arithmetic cost of this has been prohibitive this paper is in two parts a companion paper ii computing the cosine Transformation, shows that this objection can be overcome by computing the cosine transformation by a modification of the fast fourier transform algorithm this first part discusses the strategy and various error estimates and summarizes experience with a particular implementation of the scheme cacm May, 1972 Gentleman, W.
