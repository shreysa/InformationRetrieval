tropical cyclone warnings and watches are two levels of alert issued by national  bodies to coastal areas threatened by the imminent approach of a  of tropical storm or hurricane intensity they are notices to the local population and civil authorities to make appropriate preparation for the cyclone including evacuation of vulnerable areas where necessary it is important that interests throughout the area of an alert make preparations to protect life and property and do not disregard it on the strength of the detailed forecast track tropical cyclones are not points and forecasting their track remains an uncertain science

new tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the southern hemisphere and at least every six hours in the northern hemisphere from regional specialized meteorological centers and tropical cyclone warning centers in conjunction with the  the national meteorological and hydrological services of  the northern  and the northeastern  east of the  excluding mainland africa and europe all issue tropical storm hurricane watches and warnings tropical storm watches are issued when gale and storm force winds of between 3463knots  3973mph  63118km h  are possible within 48 hours in a specified area in association with a tropical subtropical or post-tropical cyclone these watches are upgraded to tropical storm warnings when gale and storm force winds become expected to occur somewhere in the warning area within 36 hours hurricane watches are issued when sustained winds of 64 knots  74mph  119km h  are possible within 48 hours in a specified area in association with a tropical subtropical or post-tropical cyclone these warnings are upgraded to hurricane warnings when hurricane-force winds become expected to occur somewhere in the warning area within 36 hours because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force the hurricane watch and warnings are issued in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds rather than in advance of the anticipated onset of hurricane-force winds at times a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch can both be in effect due to uncertainties in the forecast these watches and warnings are also issued by the  for the hawaiian islands and the weather forecast office in  for parts of  but not for  due to an international agreement within the united states an extreme wind warning is issued by the national weather service for any land areas that are expected to be impacted by a major  category 3 or higher  hurricane and by sustained surface winds greater than or equal to 100knots  115mph  185km h  the warning is issued just prior to when the strongest winds of the  are expected to impact an area the warning is to be issued for the smallest area possible and be valid for times of two hours or less it was developed in response to confusion resulting from the landfall of  nws offices in  and   issued 11  for areas that would not experience an actual  but would experience extreme wind speeds commonly associated with tornadoes the extreme wind warning is now expected to be used in these situations in 2017 the national hurricane center introduced a new system of warnings and watches for  which would cover the  and  of the  a storm surge watch would be issued when a life-threatening storm surge associated with a potential or ongoing tropical subtropical or post-tropical cyclone is possible within the next 48 hours these watches would be upgraded to storm surge warnings when there is a danger of life-threatening storm surge occurring within 36 hours however both watches and warnings may be issued earlier than specified if environmental conditions are expected to hamper preparations in  a color coded alert system is used to keep the public informed when a tropical cyclone or possible tropical cyclones poses a threat to the nation the scale starts with blue at the bottom being minimal danger then proceeds to a green alert which means low level danger a yellow alert signifies moderate danger followed by an orange alert that means high danger level the scale tops off with a red alert the maximum level of danger west pacific systems

a two-stage warning system was long-established in china for tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity of above nowadays the use of this system is restricted to coastal waters only thus warnings may be discontinued even if a cyclone is maintaining tropical storm intensity inland color-coded alerts  below  may be in effect independently of any two-stage warnings 
warning  winds may reach  8 or rainstorm may occur in 48 hours urgent warning  winds may reach beaufort force 8 or rainstorm may occur in 24 hours 
guangdong introduced a color-coded tropical cyclone warning system for land use in 1999 
white alert  a tropical cyclone may affect the area in 48 hours green alert  winds may reach  6 in 24 hours or winds of beaufort force 6 7 are already blowing yellow alert  winds may reach beaufort force 8 in 12 hours or winds of beaufort force 8 9  gale force  are already blowing red alert  winds may reach beaufort force 10 in 12 hours or winds of beaufort force 10 11  storm force  are already blowing black alert  winds may reach beaufort force 12 in 12 hours or winds of beaufort force 12  hurricane force  are already blowing 
similar systems were developed in  and  later  standardized the system for national use this set is part of a larger warning system that covers other forms of severe weather conditions such as extreme temperature torrential rainfall drought etc  maintained a white alert as in the old system 
blue alert  winds may reach  6 in 24 hours or winds of beaufort force 6 7 are already blowing yellow alert  winds may reach beaufort force 8 in 24 hours or winds of beaufort force 8 9  gale force  are already blowing orange alert  winds may reach beaufort force 10 in 12 hours or winds of beaufort force 10 11  storm force  are already blowing red alert  winds may reach beaufort force 12 in 6 hours or winds of beaufort force 12  hurricane force  are already blowing 
hong kong and macau 
main article  
the  uses a variety of warning systems to inform the public regarding the risks of tropical cyclones to the area the  issues typhoon signals to indicate the existence and effects of a tropical cyclone on  the  in  uses a similar system the signal system consists of 8 signals in 5 levels numbered non-consecutively for historical reasons  each signal has a day signal and a night signal for hoisting which are still hoisted in macau but no longer hoisted in hong kong day signals are also used as signal symbols in both places 
signal no 1  a tropical cyclone is centred within 800 km of the territory and may affect the territory later signal no 3  strong wind with a sustained speed of 4162 km h gusts may exceed 110 km h signals nos 8 nw 8 sw 8 ne 8 se  gale or storm force wind with a sustained speed of 63117 km h from the northwest southwest northeast southeast quadrants respectively gusts may exceed 180 km h signal no 9   hong kong  gale or storm force wind is increasing or expected to increase significantly in strength    macau  the centre of a tropical cyclone is approaching and macau is expected to be severely affected signal no 10  hurricane force wind with a sustained speed over 118 km h gusts may exceed 220 km h 
japan 
main article  
the japan meteorological agency  jma  is the government agency responsible for gathering and providing results for the public in  that are obtained from data based on daily scientific observation and research into  in the fields of    and  among other related scientific fields its headquarters is located in  is also designated one of the   rsmc  of the  it has the responsibility for   and distribution of warnings for  in the  region philippines 

the   pagasa  releases tropical cyclone warnings in the form of public storm warning signals  or just storm signals  an area having a storm signal may be under 

psws  1  tropical cyclone winds of 3061km h are expected within the next 36 hours  note  if a tropical cyclone forms very close to the area then a shorter lead time is seen on the warning bulletin 
psws  2  tropical cyclone winds of 61120km h are expected within the next 24 hours psws  3  tropical cyclone winds of 121170km h are expected within the next 18 hours psws  4  tropical cyclone winds of 171220km h are expected within 12 hours psws  5  tropical cyclone winds greater than 220km h are expected within 12 hours 
these storm signals are usually heightened when an area  in the philippines only  is about to be hit by a tropical cyclone thus as a tropical cyclone gains strength and or gets closer to an area having a storm signal it may be heightened to another higher signal in that particular area whereas as a tropical cyclone weakens and or gets farther away from an area it may be downgraded to a lower signal or may be lifted  that is an area will have no storm signal   south pacific basin 
the australian  will issue a cyclone watch for a specified part of australia when a tropical cyclone is expected to cause gale-force winds in excess of 62km h  40mph  within 2448 hours and subsequently make landfall a cyclone warning is subsequently issued for a specified part of australia when a tropical cyclone is expected to cause or is causing gale-force winds in excess of 62km h  40mph  within 24 hours and is subsequently expected to make landfall the   fms  issues a tropical cyclone alert for the        and  when a tropical cyclone has a significant probability of causing gale-force winds or stronger winds within 2448 hours gale storm and hurricane-force wind warnings are subsequently issued for the above areas by fms when a tropical cyclone is either causing or expected to cause either gale storm or hurricane-force winds within 24 hours mto-france is responsible for the issuance of tropical cyclone watches and warnings for    and the  the national meteorological and hydrological services of the     new zealand  and  are responsible for their own watches and warnings indian ocean systems 
the   imd rsmc new delhi  is responsible for tracking tropical cyclones within the north indian ocean  in   mfr rsmc la reunion  is responsible for the issuing advisories and tracking of tropical cyclones in the southwest part of the basin however the naming of systems is deferred to the mauritius and madagascar weather services india 

the imd issues warnings in four stages for the indian coast 
stage 1  cyclone watch  issued 72 hours in advance it discusses the likelihood of development of a cyclonic disturbance in the north indian ocean and the coastal region likely to experience adverse weather stage 2  cyclone alert  issued 48 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas stage 3  cyclone warning  issued 24 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas the location of landfall is discussed at this stage stage 4  landfall outlook  issued 12 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather over the coastal areas the track of the cyclone after the landfall and the possible impact inland is discussed at this stage 
cyclonic storm conditions mean what winds in excess of 63 km h  39 mph  are possible military advisories
the  uses a multi-stage system called the tropical cyclone condition of readiness  tc-cors  otherwise known as the hurricane condition of readiness  hurcons  to prepare bases and evacuate assets and personnel in advance of adverse weather associated with tropical cyclones 
tc-cors are recommended by weather facilities either on base or by central sites like the  or the  and are generally related to the timing and potential for destructive sustained windspeeds of above 50kn  58mph  93km h  recommendations are then considered by base or area commanders along with other subjective factors for setting the tc-cors like assets holidays or the bases experience in emergency preparedness the bases prefer to set these tc-cors sequentially from tc-cor 5 with destructive winds expected within 96 hours through tc-cor 4 3 2 and if needed to a series of four different tc-cor 1 conditions however depending on the cyclone s movement or location some of these signals can be skipped after a system passes and stops affecting the base the authorities can decide to revert to the seasonal tc-cor or stay in a heightened approach as another tropical cyclone is approaching see also
