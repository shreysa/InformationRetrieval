an ice storm is a type of  characterized by  also known as a glaze event or in some parts of the united states as a silver thaw the u.s national weather service defines an ice storm as a storm which results in the accumulation of at least 0.25-inch  6.4mm  of ice on exposed surfaces from 1982 to 1994 ice storms were more common than  and averaged 16 per year they are generally not violent storms but instead are commonly perceived as gentle rains occurring at temperatures just below freezing

formation 




a graph showing the formation of different kinds of precipitation 

the formation of ice begins with a layer of above-freezing air above a layer of sub-freezing temperatures closer to the surface frozen  melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below if the precipitate refreezes while still in the air it will land on the ground as  alternatively the liquid droplets can continue to fall without freezing passing through the cold air just above the surface this thin layer of air then cools the rain to a temperature below freezing  0c or 32f  however the drops themselves do not freeze a phenomenon called   or forming   when the supercooled drops strike ground or anything else below 0c  32f   e.g power lines tree branches aircraft  a layer of ice accumulates as the cold water drips off forming a slowly thickening film of ice hence freezing rain while meteorologists can predict when and where an ice storm will occur some storms still occur with little or no warning in the united states most ice storms are in the northeastern part of the country but damaging storms have occurred farther south an ice storm in february 1994 resulted in tremendous ice accumulation as far south as mississippi and caused reported damage in nine states more timber was damaged than that caused by  an ice storm in   in november 1996 directly followed heavy snowfall the combined weight of the snow and 25 to 37 millimeters  0.98 to 1.46in  of ice caused widespread damage and was considered the most severe ice storm in the  area since 1940 effect 




power lines sagging after an ice storm besides disrupting transportation ice storms can disrupt utilities by snapping lines and poles 

the freezing rain from an ice storm covers everything with heavy smooth  in addition to hazardous driving or walking conditions branches or even whole trees may break from the weight of ice falling branches can block roads tear down power and telephone lines and cause other damage even without falling trees and tree branches the weight of the ice itself can easily snap power lines and also break and bring down power utility poles  even  with steel frames this can leave people without power for anywhere from several days to a month according to most meteorologists just one quarter of an inch of ice accumulation can add about 500 pounds  230kg  of weight per line span damage from ice storms is easily capable of shutting down entire metropolitan areas 



devastation caused by an ice storm


additionally the loss of power during ice storms has indirectly caused numerous illnesses and deaths due to unintentional carbon monoxide  co  poisoning at lower levels co poisoning causes symptoms such as nausea dizziness fatigue and headache but high levels can cause unconsciousness heart failure and death the relatively high incidence of co poisoning during ice storms occurs due to the use of alternative methods of heating and cooking during prolonged power outages common after severe ice storms gas generators charcoal and  barbecues and  contribute to co poisoning when they operate in confined locations co is produced when appliances burn fuel without enough oxygen present such as basements and other indoor locations loss of electricity during ice storms can indirectly lead to  and even death from hypothermia it can also lead to ruptured pipes due to water freezing inside the pipes notable ice storms 
an ice storm which struck  set a record for thickest recorded ice accumulation from a single storm in the united states at 8inches in march 1991 a major ice storm in the area of rochester ny caused  375 million in damages placing it among the worst natural disasters in new york state history in february 1994 a severe ice storm caused over  1 billion in damage in the southern united states primarily in mississippi tennessee and alabama the  occurred during january 59 1998 it was one of the most devastating and costly ice storms in  and potentially one of the most devastating ice storms in  the storm caused massive power failures in several large cities on the  the most affected area was extreme  and southwestern  in  where over 3 million people were without power for up to a month and a half whole trees snapped and electrical pylons were completely flattened under the weight of the accumulated ice the  was impacted by a  which left about 1.25 million homes and businesses without power areas impacted with 34 to 1in  19 to 25mm  of ice accumulation included eastern  in the  area  and  southern  coastal and south-central   in the  region  and southern  southern new hampshire and northernmost massachusetts got hit the worst with the storm with ice accumulations ranging from 1.5 to 3in  38 to 76mm  of ice this left residents unable to get supplies go to work etc due to blocked roads from trees that fell on the roads any trees that fell quickly took down power poles it took utility crews from 4 to as many as 16 days to get a look at the damage and start to restore power to nearly 1.3 million people in all there were 675,000 residents in new hampshire without power and around 500,000 in northern massachusetts 
in late  covered several u.s states including  and  most areas affected saw over 2in  51mm  of ice accumulation and between 15in  25127mm  of snow on top of the ice this ice storm left well over 2 million people without power at its peak and killed 55 people 24 in kentucky  in arkansas and kentucky activated emergency response plans to deal with power loss to small water utilities across their states neighboring state rural water associations including experienced emergency responders from louisiana and florida loaned equipment and manpower to assist the hardest-hit areas during the unusually severe  heavy snow had fallen over much of the country in late december and early january by the second week of january many of the roads and pavements had been cleared by local councils due to the use of rock salt gritting however during the early hours of january 12 a wet front  moved across the country causing freezing rain and heavy ice glaze particularly in the south and west  areas of northern england  crucially this rainfall had stopped before first light  when the local population prepared to set out for work and school they saw from their windows what appeared to be clear roads and pavements but were in fact treacherous sheets of  cars and buses almost immediately encounted extreme difficulty and emergency services were called to dozens of accidents pedestrians in the village of  found the only safe way to proceed was to crawl on all fours accident and emergency units at hospitals in the   and  areas found themselves inundated by people with broken bones fractures and sprains and many schools were closed as it was judged unsafe for pupils to attempt to make their way there on december 25 2010 freezing rain fell on  and its vicinity the glaze ice accumulation caused a number of accidents and power outages of which the most serious was damage caused to two power lines feeding  causing a complete blackout of the airport and express railway that connected it to the city as a result the airport was shut down and hundreds of passengers were stranded inside with taxi drivers charging up to 10,000 rubles  usd 330  for a one-hour drive to the city other city airports  and  where air traffic was re-routed and amid heavy snowfall that followed ice rain collapsed a day later causing a full air transport collapse gallery
