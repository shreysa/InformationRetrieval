weather radar also called weather surveillance radar  wsr  and doppler weather radar is a type of  used to locate  calculate its motion and estimate its type  rain snow  etc  modern weather radars are mostly  capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to the intensity of the precipitation both types of data can be analyzed to determine the structure of storms and their potential to cause  during  operators discovered that weather was causing echoes on their screen masking potential enemy targets techniques were developed to filter them but scientists began to study the phenomenon soon after the war  radars were used to detect precipitation since then weather radar has evolved on its own and is now used by national weather services research departments in universities and in television newscasts raw images are routinely used and specialized software can take radar data to make short term  of future positions and intensities of rain snow hail and other weather phenomena radar output is even incorporated into  models to improve analyses and forecasts

history 







during world war ii military radar operators noticed noise in returned echoes due to rain snow and  after the war military scientists returned to civilian life or continued in the armed forces and pursued their work in developing a use for those echoes in the united states  at first working for the  and later for  developed the first operational weather radars in canada j.s marshall and r.h douglas formed the  stormy weather group  in montreal marshall and his doctoral student walter palmer are well known for their work on the drop size distribution in mid-latitude rain that led to understanding of the z-r relation which correlates a given radar  with the rate at which rainwater is falling in the united kingdom research continued to study the radar echo patterns and weather elements such as  rain and  and experiments were done to evaluate the potential of different wavelengths from 1 to 10 centimeters by 1950 the uk company  was demonstrating its airborne  cloud and collision warning search radar equipment  



1960s radar technology detected tornado producing  over the  metropolitan area 

in 1953 donald staggs an electrical engineer working for the illinois state water survey made the first recorded radar observation of a   associated with a tornadic thunderstorm between 1950 and 1980 reflectivity radars which measure position and intensity of precipitation were incorporated by weather services around the world the early meteorologists had to watch a  during the 1970s radars began to be standardized and organized into networks the first devices to capture radar images were developed the number of scanned angles was increased to get a three-dimensional view of the precipitation so that horizontal cross-sections   and vertical cross-sections could be performed studies of the organization of thunderstorms were then possible for the  in canada and   nssl  in the us in particular the nssl created in 1964 began experimentation on dual  signals and on  uses in may 1973 a tornado devastated  just west of  for the first time a dopplerized 10cm wavelength radar from nssl documented the entire life cycle of the tornado the researchers discovered a  rotation in the cloud aloft before the tornado touched the ground  the  nssl s research helped convince the  that doppler radar was a crucial forecasting tool the  of tornadoes on 34 april 1974 and their devastating destruction might have helped to get funding for further developments 
between 1980 and 2000 weather radar networks became the norm in north america europe japan and other developed countries conventional radars were replaced by doppler radars which in addition to position and intensity could track the relative velocity of the particles in the air in the united states the construction of a network consisting of 10cm radars called  or wsr-88d  weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler  was started in 1988 following nssl s research in canada  constructed the  station with a 5cm research doppler radar by 1985  mcgill university dopplerized its radar   in 1993 this led to a complete  between 1998 and 2004 france and other european countries had switched to doppler networks by the early 2000s meanwhile rapid advances in computer technology led to algorithms to detect signs of severe weather and many applications for media outlets and researchers after 2000 research on dual polarization technology moved into operational use increasing the amount of information available on precipitation type  e.g rain vs snow    dual polarization  means that microwave radiation which is  both horizontally and vertically  with respect to the ground  is emitted wide-scale deployment was done by the end of the decade or the beginning of the next in some countries such as the united states france and canada in april 2013 all  nexrads were completely dual-polarized since 2003 the u.s  has been experimenting with  as a replacement for conventional parabolic antenna to provide more time resolution in  this could be significant with severe thunderstorms as their evolution can be better evaluated with more timely data also in 2003 the national science foundation established the   casa  a multidisciplinary multi-university collaboration of engineers computer scientists meteorologists and sociologists to conduct fundamental research develop enabling technology and deploy prototype engineering systems designed to augment existing radar systems by sampling the generally undersampled lower troposphere with inexpensive fast scanning dual polarization mechanically scanned and phased array radars how a weather radar works




a radar beam spreads out as it moves away from the radar station covering an increasingly large volume 

weather radars send directional pulses of  radiation on the order of a  long using a  or  tube connected by a  to a  the wavelengths of 1  10cm are approximately ten times the diameter of the droplets or ice particles of interest because  occurs at these frequencies this means that part of the energy of each pulse will bounce off these small particles back in the direction of the radar station shorter wavelengths are useful for smaller particles but the signal is more quickly attenuated thus 10cm   radar is preferred but is more expensive than a 5cm  system 3cm  radar is used only for short-range units and 1cm  weather radar is used only for research on small-particle phenomena such as drizzle and fog  weather radar systems have seen limited university use but due to quicker attenuation most data are not operational radar pulses spread out as they move away from the radar station thus the volume of air that a radar pulse is traversing is larger for areas farther away from the station and smaller for nearby areas decreasing  at far distances at the end of a 150  200km sounding range the volume of air scanned by a single pulse might be on the order of a cubic kilometer this is called the pulse volume
the volume of air that a given pulse takes up at any point in time may be approximated by the formula  where v is the volume enclosed by the pulse h is pulse width  in e.g meters calculated from the duration in seconds of the pulse times the speed of light  r is the distance from the radar that the pulse has already traveled  in e.g meters  and  is the beam width  in radians  this formula assumes the beam is symmetrically circular  r  is much greater than  h  so  r  taken at the beginning or at the end of the pulse is almost the same and the shape of the volume is a cone  of depth  h  listening for return signals 
between each pulse the radar station serves as a receiver as it listens for return signals from particles in the air the duration of the  listen  cycle is on the order of a  which is a thousand times longer than the pulse duration the length of this phase is determined by the need for the microwave radiation  which travels at the   to propagate from the detector to the weather target and back again a distance which could be several hundred kilometers the horizontal distance from station to target is calculated simply from the amount of time that elapses from the initiation of the pulse to the detection of the return signal the time is converted into distance by multiplying by the speed of light in air 



where c   299,792.458  is the  and n  1.0003 is the refractive index of air if pulses are emitted too frequently the returns from one pulse will be confused with the returns from previous pulses resulting in incorrect distance calculations determining height 




the radar beam path with height


assuming the earth is round the radar beam in vacuum would rise according to the reverse curvature of the earth however the atmosphere has a  that diminishes with height due to its diminishing density this bends the radar beam slightly toward the ground and with a  this is equivalent to considering that the curvature of the beam is 4 3 the actual curvature of the earth depending on the elevation angle of the antenna and other considerations the following formula may be used to calculate the target s height above ground 



where 

r   distance radartarget ke   4 3 ae    radius e    above the  ha   height of the feedhorn above ground 




scanned volume by using multiple elevation angles


a weather radar network uses a series of typical angles that will be set according to the needs after each scanning rotation the antenna elevation is changed for the next sounding this scenario will be repeated on many angles to scan all the volume of air around the radar within the maximum range usually this scanning strategy is completed within 5 to 10 minutes to have data within 15km above ground and 250km distance of the radar for instance in canada the 5cm weather radars use angles ranging from 0.3 to 25 degrees the image to the right shows the volume scanned when multiple angles are used due to the earth s curvature and change of index of refraction with height the radar cannot  see  below the height above ground of the minimal angle  shown in green  or closer to the radar than the maximal one  shown as a red cone in the center  calibrating intensity of return 
because the targets are not unique in each volume the  has to be developed beyond the basic one assuming a  where  



where  is received power  is transmitted power  is the gain of the transmitting receiving antenna  is radar wavelength  is the radar cross section of the target and  is the distance from transmitter to target in this case we have to add the cross sections of all the targets

notice that the return now varies inversely to  instead of  in order to compare the data coming from different distances from the radar one has to normalize them with this ratio 
data types 
reflectivity  in decibel or dbz 
return echoes from targets  reflectivity  are analyzed for their intensities to establish the precipitation rate in the scanned volume the wavelengths used  110cm  ensure that this return is proportional to the rate because they are within the validity of  which states that the targets must be much smaller than the wavelength of the scanning wave  by a factor of 10  reflectivity perceived by the radar  ze  varies by the sixth power of the rain droplets  diameter  d  the square of the dielectric constant  k  of the targets and the drop size distribution  e.g n of marshall-palmer  of the drops this gives a truncated   of the form 



precipitation rate  r  on the other hand is equal to the number of particles their volume and their fall speed  v  as 



so ze and r have similar functions that can be resolved giving a relation between the two of the form 

z   arb

where a and b depend on the type of precipitation  snow rain  or   which has different  k n0 and v 
as the antenna scans the atmosphere on every angle of azimuth it obtains a certain strength of return from each type of target encountered reflectivity is then averaged for that target to have a better data set since variation in diameter and dielectric constant of the targets can lead to large variability in power return to the radar reflectivity is expressed in dbz  10 times the logarithm of the ratio of the echo to a standard 1mm diameter drop filling the same scanned volume  
how to read reflectivity on a radar display 
radar returns are usually described by colour or level the colours in a radar image normally range from blue or green for weak returns to red or magenta for very strong returns the numbers in a verbal report increase with the severity of the returns for example the u.s national doppler radar sites use the following scale for different levels of reflectivity 

magenta  65 dbz  extremely heavy precipitation possible hail 
red  52 dbz
yellow  36 dbz
green  20 dbz  light precipitation 

strong returns  red or magenta  may indicate not only heavy rain but also thunderstorms hail strong winds or tornadoes but they need to be interpreted carefully for reasons described below aviation conventions 
when describing weather radar returns pilots dispatchers and air traffic controllers will typically refer to three return levels 

level 1 corresponds to a green radar return indicating usually light precipitation and little to no turbulence leading to a possibility of reduced visibility level 2 corresponds to a yellow radar return indicating moderate precipitation leading to the possibility of very low visibility moderate turbulence and an uncomfortable ride for aircraft passengers level 3 corresponds to a red radar return indicating heavy precipitation leading to the possibility of thunderstorms and severe turbulence and structural damage to the aircraft 
aircraft will try to avoid level 2 returns when possible and will always avoid level 3 unless they are specially-designed research aircraft precipitation types 
some displays provided by commercial weather sites like  show precipitation types during the winter month  rain snow mixed precipitations   and   this is not an analysis of the radar data itself but a post-treatment done with other data sources the primary being surface reports   over the area covered by radar echoes a program assigns a precipitation type according to the surface temperature and  reported at the underlying  precipitation types reported by human operated stations and certain automatic ones   will have higher weight then the program does interpolations to produce an image with defined zones these will include  errors due to the calculation  variations of the precipitation zones will also be lost more sophisticated programs use the  output from models such as  and  for the precipitation types and apply it as a first guess to the radar echoes then use the surface data for final output until dual-polarization  section  below  data are widely available any precipitation types on radar images are only indirect information and must be taken with care velocity 




idealized example of doppler output approaching velocities are in blue and receding velocities are in red notice the sinusoidal variation of speed when going around the display at a particular range

precipitation is found in and below clouds light precipitation such as drops and flakes is subject to the air currents and scanning radar can pick up the horizontal component of this motion thus giving the possibility to estimate the wind speed and direction where precipitation is present a target s motion relative to the radar station causes a change in the reflected frequency of the radar pulse due to the  with velocities of less than 70-metre second for weather echos and radar wavelength of 10cm this amounts to a change only 0.1  this difference is too small to be noted by electronic instruments however as the targets move slightly between each pulse the returned wave has a noticeable  difference or phase shift from pulse to pulse pulse pair 
doppler weather radars use this phase difference  pulse pair difference  to calculate the precipitation s motion the intensity of the successively returning pulse from the same scanned volume where targets have slightly moved is 

so  v   target speed    this speed is called the radial doppler velocity because it gives only the  variation of distance versus time between the radar and the target the real speed and direction of motion has to be extracted by the process described below doppler dilemma 




maximum range from reflectivity  red  and unambiguous doppler velocity range  blue  with 


the phase between pulse pairs can vary from  and   so the unambiguous doppler velocity range is

vmax   

this is called the  velocity this is inversely dependent on the time between successive pulses  the smaller the interval the larger is the unambiguous velocity range however we know that the maximum range from reflectivity is directly proportional to  

x   

the choice becomes increasing the range from reflectivity at the expense of velocity range or increasing the latter at the expense of range from reflectivity in general the useful range compromise is 100150km for reflectivity this means for a wavelength of 5cm  as shown in the diagram  an unambiguous velocity range of 12.5 to 18.75 metre second is produced  for 150km and 100km respectively  for a 10cm radar such as the nexrad the unambiguous velocity range would be doubled some techniques using two alternating pulse repetition frequencies  prf  allow a greater doppler range the velocities noted with the first pulse rate could be equal or different with the second for instance if the maximum velocity with a certain rate is 10 metre second and the one with the other rate is 15m s the data coming from both will be the same up to 10m s and will differ thereafter it is then possible to find a mathematical relation between the two returns and calculate the real velocity beyond the limitation of the two prfs doppler interpretation 




radial component of real winds when scanning through 360 degrees


in a uniform rainstorm moving eastward a radar beam pointing west will  see  the raindrops moving toward itself while a beam pointing east will  see  the drops moving away when the beam scans to the north or to the south no relative motion is noted synoptic 
in the  interpretation the user can extract the wind at different levels over the radar coverage region as the beam is scanning 360 degrees around the radar data will come from all those angles and be the radial projection of the actual wind on the individual angle the intensity pattern formed by this scan can be represented by a cosine curve  maximum in the precipitation motion and zero in the perpendicular direction  one can then calculate the direction and the strength of the motion of particles as long as there is enough coverage on the radar screen however the rain drops are falling as the radar only sees the radial component and has a certain elevation from ground the radial velocities are contaminated by some fraction of the falling speed this component is negligible in small elevation angles but must be taken into account for higher scanning angles meso scale 
in the velocity data there could be smaller zones in the radar coverage where the wind varies from the one mentioned above for example a thunderstorm is a  phenomenon which often includes rotations and  these may only cover few square kilometers but are visible by variations in the radial speed users can recognize velocity patterns in the wind associated with rotations such as  convergence   and divergence   polarization 




targeting with dual will reveal the form of the droplet


 tend to have a larger horizontal axis due to the  of air while falling  water droplets  this causes the water   to be oriented in that direction  so radar beams are generally polarized horizontally in order to receive the maximal signal reflection if two pulses are sent simultaneously with  polarization  vertical and horizontal zv and zh respectively  two independent sets of data will be received these signals can be compared in several useful ways 



differential reflectivity  zdr   the differential reflectivity is the ratio of the reflected vertical and horizontal power returns as zv zh among other things it is a good indicator of drop shape and drop shape is a good estimate of average drop size correlation coefficient  hv   a statistical correlation between the reflected horizontal and vertical power returns high values near one indicate homogeneous precipitation types while lower values indicate regions of mixed precipitation types such as rain and snow or hail or in extreme cases debris aloft usually coinciding with a  linear depolarization ratio  ldr   this is a ratio of a vertical power return from a horizontal pulse or a horizontal power return from a vertical pulse it can also indicate regions where there is a mixture of precipitation types differential phase  dp   the differential phase is a comparison of the returned phase difference between the horizontal and vertical pulses this change in phase is caused by the difference in the number of wave cycles  or wavelengths  along the propagation path for horizontal and vertically polarized waves it should not be confused with the doppler frequency shift which is caused by the motion of the cloud and precipitation particles unlike the differential reflectivity correlation coefficient and linear depolarization ratio which are all dependent on reflected power the differential phase is a  propagation effect  it is a very good estimator of rain rate and is not affected by  the range derivative of differential phase  specific differential phase kdp  can be used to localize areas of strong precipitation attenuation 


with more information about particle shape dual-polarization radars can more easily distinguish airborne debris from precipitation making it easier to locate  with this new knowledge added to the reflectivity velocity and spectrum width produced by doppler weather radars researchers have been working on developing algorithms to differentiate precipitation types non-meteorological targets and to produce better rainfall accumulation estimates in the u.s  and  have been world leaders in this field  established a test deployment for dual-polametric radar at nssl and equipped all its 10cm  radars with dual-polarization which was completed in april 2013 in 2004  in huntsville alabama was equipped with a sigmet antenna mounted receiver giving dual-polarmetric capabilities to the operator   in  has converted its instrument  1999  and the data are used operationally by  in montreal another environment canada radar in   north of   was dual-polarized in 2005  it uses a 5cm wavelength which experiences greater  environment canada is working on converting all of its radars to dual-polarization  is planning on incorporating dual-polarizing doppler radar in its network coverage main types of radar outputs 
all data from radar scans are displayed according to the need of the users different outputs have been developed through time to reach this here is a list of common and specialized outputs available plan position indicator 
main article  




thunderstorm line viewed in reflectivity  dbz  on a ppi


since data are obtained one angle at a time the first way of displaying them has been the plan position indicator  ppi  which is only the layout of radar return on a two dimensional image one has to remember that the data coming from different distances to the radar are at different heights above ground this is very important as a high rain rate seen near the radar is relatively close to what reaches the ground but what is seen from 160km away is about 1.5km above ground and could be far different from the amount reaching the surface it is thus difficult to compare weather echoes at different distances from the radar ppis are afflicted with ground echoes near the radar as a supplemental problem these can be misinterpreted as real echoes so other products and further treatments of data have been developed to supplement such shortcomings usage  reflectivity doppler and polarimetric data can use ppi in the case of doppler data two points of view are possible  relative to the surface or the storm when looking at the general motion of the rain to extract wind at different altitudes it is better to use data relative to the radar but when looking for rotation or wind shear under a thunderstorm it is better to use the storm relative images that subtract the general motion of precipitation leaving the user to view the air motion as if he would be sitting on the cloud constant-altitude plan position indicator 




typical angles scanned in canada the zigzags represent data angles used to make cappis at 1.5km and 4 km of altitude 

main article  
to avoid some of the problems on ppis the constant-altitude plan position indicator  cappi  has been developed by canadian researchers it is basically a horizontal cross-section through radar data this way one can compare precipitation on an equal footing at difference distance from the radar and avoid ground echoes although data are taken at a certain height above ground a relation can be inferred between ground stations  reports and the radar data cappis call for a large number of angles from near the horizontal to near the vertical of the radar to have a cut that is as close as possible at all distance to the height needed even then after a certain distance there isn t any angle available and the cappi becomes the ppi of the lowest angle the zigzag line on the angles diagram above shows the data used to produce 1.5km and 4km height cappis notice that the section after 120km is using the same data 
usage

since the cappi uses the closest angle to the desired height at each point from the radar the data can originate from slightly different altitudes as seen on the image in different points of the radar coverage it is therefore crucial to have a large enough number of sounding angles to minimize this height change furthermore the type of data must be changing relatively gradually with height to produce an image that is not noisy reflectivity data being relatively smooth with height cappis are mostly used for displaying them velocity data on the other hand can change rapidly in direction with height and cappis of them are not common it seems that only  is producing regularly doppler cappis with the 24 angles available on their radar however some researchers have published papers using velocity cappis to study  and development of  products finally polarimetric data are recent and often noisy there doesn t seem to have regular use of cappi for them although the sigmet company offer a software capable to produce those types of images 
real-time examples





vertical composite 




base ppi versus composite 

main article  
another solution to the ppi problems is to produce images of the maximum reflectivity in a layer above ground this solution is usually taken when the number of angles available is small or variable the american  is using such composite as their scanning scheme can vary from 4 to 14 angles according to their need which would make very coarse cappis the composite assures that no strong echo is missed in the layer and a treatment using doppler velocities eliminates the ground echoes comparing base and composite products one can locate  and  zones real time example

another important use of radar data is the ability to assess the amount of precipitation that has fallen over large basins to be used in  calculations  such data is useful in flood control sewer management and dam construction the computed data from radar weather may be used in conjunction with data from ground stations to produce radar accumulations we have to estimate the rain rate over a point by the average value over that point between one ppi or cappi and the next  then multiply by the time between those images if one wants for a longer period of time one has to add up all the accumulations from images during that time echotops 
aviation is a heavy user of radar data one map particularly important in this field is the echotops for flight planning and avoidance of dangerous weather most country weather radars are scanning enough angles to have a 3d set of data over the area of coverage it is relatively easy to estimate the maximum altitude at which precipitation is found within the volume however those are not the tops of clouds as they always extend above the precipitation vertical cross sections 
to know the vertical structure of clouds in particular thunderstorms or the level of the melting layer a vertical cross-section product of the radar data is available this is done by displaying only the data along a line from coordinates a to b taken from the different angles scanned range height indicator 
when a weather radar is scanning in only one direction vertically it obtains high resolution data along a vertical cut of the atmosphere the output of this sounding is called a range height indicator  rhi  which is excellent for viewing the detailed vertical structure of a storm this is different from the vertical cross section mentioned above by the fact that the radar is making a vertical cut along specific directions and does not scan over the entire 360 degrees around the site this kind of sounding and product is only available on research radars radar networks 




berrimah radar in  australia


over the past few decades radar networks have been extended to allow the production of composite views covering large areas for instance many countries including the united states canada and much of europe produce images that include all of their radars this is not a trivial task in fact such a network can consist of different types of radar with different characteristics such as beam width wavelength and calibration these differences have to be taken into account when matching data across the network particularly to decide what data to use when two radars cover the same point if one uses the stronger echo but it comes from the more distant radar one uses returns that are from higher altitude coming from rain or snow that might evaporate before reaching the ground   if one uses data from the closer radar it might be attenuated passing through a thunderstorm composite images of precipitations using a network of radars are made with all those limitations in mind automatic algorithms

the animation of radar products can show the evolution of reflectivity and velocity patterns the user can extract information on the dynamics of the meteorological phenomena including the ability to extrapolate the motion and observe development or dissipation this can also reveal non-meteorological artifacts  false echoes  that will be discussed later radar integrated display with geospatial elements

a new popular presentation of weather radar data in united states is via radar integrated display with geospatial elements  ridge  in which the radar data is projected on a map with geospatial elements such as topography maps highways state county boundaries and weather warnings the projection often is flexible giving the user a choice of various geographic elements it is frequently used in conjunction with animations of radar data over a time period 
limitations and artifacts 







radar data interpretation depends on many hypotheses about the atmosphere and the weather targets including 

 targets small enough to obey the rayleigh scattering resulting in the return being proportional to the precipitation rate the volume scanned by the beam is full of meteorological targets  rain snow etc  all of the same variety and in a uniform concentration no 
no amplification
return from side lobes of the beam are negligible the beam is close to a  curve with power decreasing to half at half the width the outgoing and returning waves are similarly polarized there is no return from multiple reflections 
these assumptions are not always met  one must be able to differentiate between reliable and dubious echoes anomalous propagation  non-standard atmosphere 
main article  
the first assumption is that the radar beam is moving through air that cools down at a certain rate with height the position of the echoes depend heavily on this hypothesis however the real atmosphere can vary greatly from the norm super refraction 
 often form near the ground for instance by air cooling at night while remaining warm aloft as the  of air decreases faster than normal the radar beam bends toward the ground instead of continuing upward eventually it will hit the ground and be reflected back toward the radar the processing program will then wrongly place the return echoes at the height and distance it would have been in normal conditions this type of false return is relatively easy to spot on a time loop if it is due to night cooling or marine inversion as one sees very strong echoes developing over an area spreading in size laterally but not moving and varying greatly in intensity however inversion of temperature exists ahead of  and the abnormal propagation echoes are then mixed with real rain the extreme of this problem is when the inversion is very strong and shallow the radar beam reflects many times toward the ground as it has to follow a  path this will create multiple bands of strong echoes on the radar images this situation can be found with inversions of temperature aloft or rapid decrease of moisture with height in the former case it could be difficult to notice under refraction 
on the other hand if the air is unstable and cools faster than the standard atmosphere with height the beam ends up higher than expected this indicates that precipitation is occurring higher than the actual height such an error is difficult to detect without additional temperature lapse-rate data for the area non-rayleigh targets 
if we want to reliably estimate the precipitation rate the targets have to be 10 times smaller than the radar wave according to rayleigh scattering this is because the water molecule has to be excited by the radar wave to give a return this is relatively true for rain or snow as 5 or 10cm wavelength radars are usually employed however for very large hydrometeors since the wavelength is on the order of stone the return levels off according to  a return of more than 55 dbz is likely to come from hail but won t vary proportionally to the size on the other hand very small targets such as cloud droplets are too small to be excited and do not give a recordable return on common weather radars resolution and partially filled scanned volume 




profiler high resolution view of a thunderstorm  top  and by a weather radar  bottom  





a supercell thunderstorm seen from two radars almost colocated the top image is from a  and the bottom one from a  

as demonstrated at the start of the article radar beams have a physical dimension and data are sampled at discrete angles not continuously along each angle of elevation this results in an averaging of the values of the returns for reflectivity velocities and polarization data on the resolution volume scanned in the figure to the left at the top is a view of a thunderstorm taken by a  as it was passing overhead this is like a vertical cross section through the cloud with 150-metre vertical and 30-metre horizontal resolution the reflectivity has large variations in a short distance compare this with a simulated view of what a regular weather radar would see at 60km in the bottom of the figure everything has been smoothed out not only the coarser resolution of the radar blur the image but the sounding incorporates area that are echo free thus extending the thunderstorm beyond its real boundaries this shows how the output of weather radar is only an approximation of reality the image to the right compares real data from two radars almost colocated the  has about half the  of the other and one can see twice more details than with the nexrad resolution can be improved by newer equipment but some things cannot as mentioned previously the volume scanned increases with distance so the possibility that the beam is only partially filled also increases this leads to underestimation of the precipitation rate at larger distances and fools the user into thinking that rain is lighter as it moves away 
beam geometry 
the radar beam has a distribution of energy similar to the  pattern of a light passing through a slit this is because the wave is transmitted to the parabolic antenna through a slit in the wave-guide at the focal point most of the energy is at the center of the beam and decreases along a curve close to a gaussian function on each side however there are secondary peaks of emission that will sample the targets at off-angles from the center designers attempt to minimize the power transmitted by such lobes but they cannot be completely eliminated when a secondary lobe hits a reflective target such as a mountain or a strong thunderstorm some of the energy is reflected to the radar this energy is relatively weak but arrives at the same time that the central peak is illuminating a different azimuth the echo is thus misplaced by the processing program this has the effect of actually broadening the real weather echo making a smearing of weaker values on each side of it this causes the user to overestimate the extent of the real echoes 

non-weather targets 
there is more than rain and snow in the sky other objects can be misinterpreted as rain or snow by weather radars insects and  are swept along by the prevailing winds while birds follow their own course as such fine line patterns within weather radar imagery associated with converging winds are dominated by insect returns bird migration which tends to occur overnight within the lowest 2000 metres of the  contaminates wind profiles gathered by weather radar particularly the  by increasing the environmental wind returns by 3060km hr other objects within radar imagery include 

thin metal strips   dropped by military aircraft to fool enemies solid obstacles such as mountains buildings and aircraft ground and sea clutter reflections from nearby buildings  urban spikes  
such extraneous objects have characteristics that allow a trained eye to distinguish them it is also possible to eliminate some of them with post-treatment of data using reflectivity doppler and polarization data wind farms

the rotating blades of  on modern  can return the radar beam to the radar if they are in its path since the blades are moving the echoes will have a velocity and can be mistaken for real precipitation the closer the wind farm the stronger the return and the combined signal from many towers is stronger in some conditions the radar can even see toward and away velocities that generate false positives for the  algorithm on weather radar  such an event occurred in 2009 in  as with other structures that stand in the beam  of radar returns from beyond windmills may also lead to underestimation 
attenuation 




example of strong attenuation when a line of  moves over  from left to right images  a 5 cm wavelength weather radar  red arrow  source  environment canada


microwaves used in weather radars can be absorbed by rain depending on the wavelength used for 10cm radars this attenuation is negligible that is the reason why countries with high water content storms are using 10cm wavelength for example the us nexrad the cost of a larger antenna klystron and other related equipment is offset by this benefit for a 5cm radar absorption becomes important in heavy rain and this attenuation leads to underestimation of echoes in and beyond a strong thunderstorm canada and other northern countries use this less costly kind of radar as the precipitation in such areas is usually less intense however users must consider this characteristic when interpreting data the images above show how a strong line of echoes seems to vanish as it moves over the radar to compensate for this behaviour radar sites are often chosen to somewhat overlap in coverage to give different points of view of the same storms shorter wavelengths are even more attenuated and are only useful on short range radar many television stations in the united states have 5cm radars to cover their audience area knowing their limitations and using them with the local nexrad can supplement the data available to a meteorologist due to the spread of dual-polarization radar systems robust and efficient approaches for the compesantion of rain attenuation are currently implemented by operational weather services bright band 




1.5km altitude cappi at the top with strong contamination from the brightband  yellows  the vertical cut at the bottom shows that this strong return is only above ground 

a radar beam s reflectivity depends on the diameter of the target and its capacity to reflect snowflakes are large but weakly reflective while rain drops are small but highly reflective when snow falls through a layer above freezing temperature it melts into rain using the reflectivity equation one can demonstrate that the returns from the snow before melting and the rain after are not too different as the change in  compensates for the change in size however during the melting process the radar wave  sees  something akin to very large droplets as snow flakes become coated with water this gives enhanced returns that can be mistaken for stronger precipitations on a ppi this will show up as an intense ring of precipitation at the altitude where the beam crosses the melting level while on a series of cappis only the ones near that level will have stronger echoes a good way to confirm a bright band is to make a vertical cross section through the data as illustrated in the picture above an opposite problem is that drizzle  precipitation with small water droplet diameter  tends not to show up on radar because radar returns are proportional to the sixth power of droplet diameter multiple reflections 







main article  
it is assumed that the beam hits the weather targets and returns directly to the radar in fact there is energy reflected in all directions most of it is weak and multiple reflections diminish it even further so what can eventually return to the radar from such an event is negligible however some situations allow a multiple-reflected radar beam to be received by the radar antenna for instance when the beam hits hail the energy spread toward the wet ground will be reflected back to the hail and then to the radar the resulting echo is weak but noticeable due to the extra path length it has to go through it arrives later at the antenna and is placed further than its source this gives a kind of triangle of false weaker reflections placed radially behind the hail 
solutions for now and the future




radar image of reflectivity with many non-weather echoes 





the same image but cleaned using the doppler velocities 

these two images show what can be presently achieved to clean up radar data the output on the left is made with the raw returns and it is difficult to spot the real weather since rain and snow clouds are usually moving one can use the doppler velocities to eliminate a good part of the clutter  ground echoes reflections from buildings seen as urban spikes anomalous propagation  the image on the right has been filtered using this property however not all non-meteorological targets remain still  birds insects dust  others like the bright band depend on the structure of the precipitation polarization offers a direct typing of the echoes which could be used to filter more false data or produce separate images for specialized purposes this recent development is expected to improve the quality of radar products

phased array weather radar in 


another question is the resolution as mentioned previously radar data are an average of the scanned volume by the beam resolution can be improved by larger antenna or denser networks a program by the   casa  aims to supplement the regular   a network in the united states  using many low cost x-band  3cm  weather radar mounted on cellular telephone towers these radars will subdivide the large area of the nexrad into smaller domains to look at altitudes below its lowest angle these will give details not currently available using 3cm radars the antenna of each radar is small  about 1 meter diameter  but the resolution is similar at short distance to that of nexrad the attenuation is significant due to the wavelength used but each point in the coverage area is seen by many radars each viewing from a different direction and compensating for data lost from others scanning strategies 
the number of elevation scanned and the time taken for a complete cycle depend on the weather situation for instance with little or no precipitation the scheme may be limited the lowest angles and using longer impulses in order to detect wind shift near the surface on the other hand in violent thundertorm situations it is better to scan on a large number of angles in order to have a 3 dimensions view of the precipitations as often as possible to mitigate those different demands scanning strategies have been developed according to the type of radar the wavelength used and the most commons weather situations in the area considered one example of scanning strategies is given by the us  radar network which has evolved with time for instance in 2008 it added extra resolution of data and in 2014 additional intra-cycle scanning of lowest level elevation   electronic sounding 
timeliness is also a point needing improvement with 5 to 10 minutes time between complete scans of weather radar much data is lost as a thunderstorm develops a  is being tested at the  in norman oklahoma to speed the data gathering a team in japan has deployed a  for  at the riken advanced institute for computational science  aics  specialized applications
aircraft application of radar systems include weather radar collision avoidance target tracking ground proximity and other systems for commercial weather radar  is the primary specification for weather radar systems using an airborne  antennas 
unlike ground weather radar which is set at a fixed angle airborne weather radar is being utilized from the nose or wing of an aircraft not only will the aircraft be moving up down left and right but it will be rolling as well to compensate for this the antenna is linked and calibrated to the vertical gyro located on the aircraft by doing this the pilot is able to set a pitch or angle to the antenna that will enable the stabilizer to keep the antenna pointed in the right direction under moderate maneuvers the small servo motors will not be able to keep up with abrupt maneuvers but it will try in doing this the pilot is able to adjust the radar so that it will point towards the weather system of interest if the airplane is at a low altitude the pilot would want to set the radar above the horizon line so that ground clutter is minimized on the display if the airplane is at a very high altitude the pilot will set the radar at a low or negative angle to point the radar towards the clouds wherever they may be relative to the aircraft if the airplane changes attitude the stabilizer will adjust itself accordingly so that the pilot doesn t have to fly with one hand and adjust the radar with the other receivers transmitters 
there are two major systems when talking about the receiver transmitter  the first is high-powered systems and the second is low-powered systems  both of which operate in the  frequency range  8,000  12,500mhz  high-powered systems operate at 10,000  60,000 watts these systems consist of magnetrons that are fairly expensive  approximately  1,700  and allow for considerable noise due to irregularities with the system thus these systems are highly dangerous for arcing and are not safe to be used around ground personnel however the alternative would be the low-powered systems these systems operate 100  200 watts and require a combination of high gain receivers signal microprocessors and transistors to operate as effectively as the high-powered systems the complex microprocessors help to eliminate noise providing a more accurate and detailed depiction of the sky also since there are fewer irregularities throughout the system the low-powered radars can be used to detect turbulence via the doppler effect since low-powered systems operate at considerable less wattage they are safe from arcing and can be used at virtually all times thunderstorm tracking

digital radar systems now have capabilities far beyond that of their predecessors digital systems now offer  tracking surveillance this provides users with the ability to acquire detailed information of each storm cloud being tracked thunderstorms are first identified by matching precipitation raw data received from the radar pulse to some sort of template preprogrammed into the system in order for a thunderstorm to be identified it has to meet strict definitions of intensity and shape that set it apart from any non-convective cloud usually it must show signs of organization in the horizontal and continuity in the vertical  a core or a more intense center to be identified and tracked by digital  once the thunderstorm cell is identified speed distance covered direction and estimated time of arrival  eta  are all tracked and recorded to be utilized later doppler radar and bird migration 
using the doppler weather radar is not limited to determine the location and velocity of  but it can track  as well as seen in the  section the  sent out by the radars bounce off rain and birds alike  or even insects like   the us  for instance have reported having the flights of birds appear on their radars as clouds and then fade away when the birds land the u.s national weather service st louis has even reported  appearing on their radars different programs in north america use regular weather radars and specialized radar data to determine the paths height of flight and timing of migrations this is useful information in planning for windmill farms placement and operation to reduce bird fatalities aviation safety and other wildlife management in europe there has been similar developments and even a comprehensive forecast program for aviation safety based on radar detection  
meteorite fall detection 




noaa nexrad radar image of the park forest il meteorite fall of 26 march 2003 

according to the  meteorite falls occur on a daily basis somewhere on earth however the database of worldwide  maintained by the  typically records only about 10-15 new meteorite falls annually
meteorite occur when a  falls into the earth s atmosphere generating an optically bright meteor by ionization and frictional heating if the meteoroid is large enough and infall velocity is low enough surviving meteorites will reach the ground when the falling meteorites decelerate below about 24km s usually at an altitude between 15 and 25km they no longer generate an optically bright meteor and enter  dark flight  because of this most meteorite falls occurring into the oceans during the day or otherwise go unnoticed it is in dark flight that falling meteorites typically fall through the interaction volumes of most types of radars it as been demonstrated that it is possible to identify falling meteorites in weather radar imagery by different studies this is especially useful for meteorite recovery as weather radar are part of widespread networks and scan the atmosphere continuously furthermore the meteorites are cause a perturbance of local winds by turbulence which is noticeable on doppler outputs and are falling nearly vertically so their resting place on the ground is close to their radar signature an example is shown in the image on the right showing the  which occurred on 26 march 2003 the red green feature at upper left is the motion of clouds near the radar itself and a signature of falling meteorites is seen inside the yellow ellipse at image center the intermixed red and green pixels indicate turbulence in this case arising from the wakes of falling high-velocity meteorites see also
