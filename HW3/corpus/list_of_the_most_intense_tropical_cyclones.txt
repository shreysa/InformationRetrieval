a collage of ten of the strongest tropical cyclones


tropical cyclone intensity is a complex topic winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas and most popular  are organized around sustained wind speeds however variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult in addition other impacts like rainfall storm surge area of wind damages and tornadoes can be significant variations in storms with similar wind speeds pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because measurements is easier to measure and consistent tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on earth however although there is strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds as each storm s relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different in the most recent and reliable records most tropical cyclones which attained a pressure of 900    26.56  or less occurred in the western north  the strongest  recorded worldwide as measured by minimum central  was  which reached a pressure of 870hpa  25.69inhg  on october 12 1979 the following list is subdivided by  data listed are provided by the official  unless otherwise noted on october 23 2015  attained the strongest 1-minute sustained winds on record at 215mph  345km h

the most intense storm in the north atlantic by lowest pressure was  the strongest storm by 1-minute sustained winds was  storms which reached a minimum central pressure of 920 hectopascals  27.17inhg  or less are listed storm information has been compiled back to 1850 though measurements were rarer until  started in the 1940s and inexact estimates were still predominant until  were implemented in the 1970s 


 




 shortly after peak intensity


the most intense storm in the eastern pacific ocean by both sustained winds and central pressure was  its sustained winds of 345km h  215mph  are also the highest on record globally storms with a minimum central pressure of 925hpa  27.32inhg  or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1949 and most storms since are only estimated because landfall  and related reconnaissance  are less common in this basin

the most intense storm by lowest pressure and peak 10-minute sustained winds was  which was also the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded storms with a minimum pressure below 900hpa  26.58inhg  are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1950

the strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the north indian ocean is the  with 3-minute sustained winds of 260km h  160mph  and a minimum pressure of 912hpa  26.93inhg  storms with an intensity of 950hpa  28.05inhg  or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1971

the most intense tropical cyclone in the south-west indian ocean is  by 10-minute sustained wind speed the strongest tropical cyclone in the south-west indian ocean is  storms with an intensity of 920hpa  27.17inhg  or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985

the most intense tropical cyclones in the australian region are  and  by 10-minute sustained wind speed the strongest are  and  storms with an intensity of 922hpa  27.23inhg  or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985

a total of 16 cyclones are listed down below reaching surpassing that intensity which most of them occurred during  seasons tropical cyclones that have been recorded since the start of the 196970 tropical cyclone year and have reached their peak intensity to the west of 160e are included in the list the most intense tropical cyclone in the south pacific  of 2016 is also the most intense storm in the southern hemisphere storms with an intensity of 920 hpa  27.17 inhg  or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985 

 




 near peak intensity


until recently it was not known that tropical cyclones could exist in the southern atlantic however  in 2004 to date the only hurricane in the south atlantic brought additional review a subsequent study found that there was an average of 1-2 subtropical or tropical cyclones per year in the southern atlantic in recent decades no official database of south atlantic cyclones exists but a partial list of tropical and subtropical systems with intensity below 1000hpa  29.53inhg  is listed
