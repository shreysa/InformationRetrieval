an  a typical modern turboprop aircraft


a turboprop engine is a  that drives an aircraft  in contrast to a  the engine s  do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust since almost all of the engine s power is used to drive the propeller in its simplest form a turboprop consists of an intake    and a  air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor where the fuel-air mixture then  the hot combustion gases expand through the turbine some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor the rest is transmitted through the reduction gearing to the propeller further expansion of the gases occurs in the propelling nozzle where the gases exhaust to atmospheric pressure the propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop

flow past a turboprop engine in operation


exhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favor of shaft power which is obtained by extracting additional power  up to that necessary to drive the compressor  from turbine expansion owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low consequently the exhaust jet typically produces around or less than 10 of the total thrust a higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at low speeds and less at higher speeds turboprops can have  up to 50-100 although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans the propeller is coupled to the turbine through a  that converts the high  low  output to low rpm high torque the propeller itself is normally a  similar to that used with larger  
unlike the small diameter fans used in  jet engines the propeller has a large diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air this permits a lower airstream velocity for a given amount of thrust as it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate a large amount of air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree a low   thrust per disc area  increases the aircraft s energy efficiency and this reduces the fuel use propellers lose efficiency as aircraft speed increases so turboprops are normally not used on high-speed aircraft above  0.6-0.7 however  engines which are very similar to turboprop engines can cruise at flight speeds approaching  0.75 to increase propeller efficiency a mechanism can be used to alter their pitch relative to the airspeed a variable-pitch propeller also called a  can also be used to generate negative thrust while decelerating on the runway additionally in the event of an engine outage the pitch can be adjusted to a vaning pitch  called   thus minimizing the drag of the non-functioning propeller 
while most modern  and  engines use  turboprop engines usually contain at least one stage of  centrifugal compressors have the advantage of being simple and lightweight at the expense of a streamlined shape 
while the power turbine may be integral with the gas generator section many turboprops today feature a free power turbine on a separate coaxial shaft this enables the propeller to rotate freely independent of compressor speed  on a turboshaft is avoided by further expansion in the turbine system and or truncating and turning the exhaust 180degrees to produce two opposing jets apart from the above there is very little difference between a turboprop and a turboshaft

 had published a paper on turbine design in 1926  investigated axial turbine designs that could be used to supply power to a shaft and thence a propeller from 1929  began work on centrifugal turbine designs that would deliver pure jet thrust the world s first turboprop was designed by the    jendrassik published a turboprop idea in 1928 and on 12 march 1929 he patented his invention in 1938 he built a small-scale  100 hp  74.6kw  experimental gas turbine the larger  with a predicted output of 1,000 bhp was produced and tested at the  in  between 1937 and 1941 it was of axial-flow design with 15 compressor and 7 turbine stages annular combustion chamber and many other modern features first run in 1940 combustion problems limited its output to 400bhp in 1941,the engine was abandoned due to war and the factory was turned over to conventional engine production the world s first turboprop engine that went into mass production was designed by a german engineer  in 1942 the first mention of turboprop engines in the general public press was in the february 1944 issue of the british aviation publication  which included a detailed cutaway drawing of what a possible future turboprop engine could look like the drawing was very close to what the future rolls-royce trent would look like the first british turboprop engine was the   a converted  fitted with reduction gear and a  7ft 11in  2.41m  five-bladed propeller two trents were fitted to  ee227  the sole  trent-meteor   which thus became the world s first turboprop-powered aircraft albeit a test-bed not intended for production it first flew on 20 september 1945 from their experience with the trent rolls-royce developed the  the first turboprop engine to be fully  for military and civil use and the  which became one of the most reliable turboprop engines ever built dart production continued for more than fifty years the dart-powered  was the first turboprop aircraft of any kind to go into production and sold in large numbers it was also the first four-engined turboprop its first flight was on 16 july 1948 the world s first single engined turboprop aircraft was thepowered  which first flew on 24 march 1948 the soviet union built on german world war ii development by junkers motorenwerke while bmw  and  also developed and partially tested designs  while the soviet union had the technology to create the airframe for a jet-powered strategic bomber comparable to boeing s  they instead produced the  bear powered with four  turboprops mated to eight   two per nacelle  with supersonic tip speeds to achieve maximum cruise speeds in excess of 575mph faster than many of the first jet aircraft and comparable to jet cruising speeds for most missions the bear would serve as their most successful long-range combat and surveillance aircraft and symbol of soviet power projection throughout the end of the 20th century the usa would incorporate contra-rotating turboprop engines such as the ill-fated twin-turbine   essentially a twinned up pair of  turboprop engines driving contra-rotating propellers  into a series of experimental aircraft during the 1950s with aircraft powered with the t40 like the  flying boat never entering u.s navy service the first american turboprop engine was the   first used in the experimental  the xp-81 first flew in december 1945 the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and  power the technology of the allison s earlier t38 design evolved into the  with quartets of the t56s being used to power the  airliner its military maritime patrol derivative the  and the widely produced  military transport aircraft one of the most produced turboprop engines used in civil aviation is the   engine 
the first turbine-powered shaft-driven helicopter was the  a development of  s k-125  which used a  turboshaft engine to power it on 11 december 1951 usage

compared to  turboprops are most efficient at flight speeds below 725km h  450mph  390 knots  because the jet velocity of the propeller  and exhaust  is relatively low modern turboprop airliners operate at nearly the same speed as small  airliners but burn two-thirds of the fuel per passenger however compared to a   which can fly at high altitude for enhanced speed and   a propeller aircraft has a lower ceiling the most common application of turboprop engines in civilian aviation is in small  where their greater power and reliability offsets their higher initial cost and fuel consumption turboprop-powered aircraft have become popular for  such as the  and  as  is easier to obtain in remote areas than   due to the high price of turboprop engines they are mostly used where high-performance short-takeoff and landing   capability and efficiency at modest flight speeds are required turboprop engines are generally used on small subsonic aircraft but the  can reach 470   870km h 541mph  large  and  aircraft such as the  and the  have also used turboprop power the  is powered by four  engines which are the third most powerful turboprop engines ever produced after the eleven megawatt-output  and 10.4 mw-output
