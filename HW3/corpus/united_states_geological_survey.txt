history 
prompted by a report from the  the usgs was created by a last-minute amendment to an act of  on march 3 1879 it was charged with the  classification of the public lands and examination of the geological structure mineral resources and products of the national domain  this task was driven by the need to inventory the vast lands added to the united states by the  in 1803 and the  in 1848 the legislation also provided that the   and  surveys be discontinued as of june 30 1879  the first director of usgs assembled the new organization from disparate regional survey agencies after a short tenure king was succeeded in the director s chair by  list of usgs directors

as of 2005 the agency is working to create a  by improving the instrumentation monitoring  and by establishing methods for measuring the relative threats posed at each site the usgs  monitors the  at magnetic observatories and distributes  data in real time the usgs collaborates with  and  government scientists along with the  to produce the  which is used to depict and track environmental issues for a continental perspective the usgs operates the streamgaging network for the united states with over 7400  real-time streamflow data are available online national climate change and wildlife science center  nccwsc  implements partner-driven science to improve understanding of past and present land use change develops relevant climate and land use forecasts and identifies lands resources and communities that are most vulnerable to adverse impacts of change from the local to global scale since 1962 the  has been involved in global  and  exploration and  in collaboration with  the usgs also operates the usgs-stanford ion microprobe laboratory a world-class  analytical facility for u thpb geochronology and trace element analyses of minerals and other earth materials usgs operates a number of water related programs notably the national streamflow information program and national water-quality assessment program usgs water data is publicly available from their national water information system database the usgs also operates the  whose mission is  to serve the nation and its natural resources by providing sound science and technical support and to disseminate information to promote science-based decisions affecting wildlife and ecosystem health the nwhc provides information technical assistance research education and leadership on national and international wildlife health issues  it is the agency primarily responsible for surveillance of   outbreaks in the united states the usgs also runs 17 biological research centers in the united states including the  the usgs is investigating collaboration with the social networking site  to allow for more rapid construction of shakemaps 
topographic mapping 




1892 15-minute map  or topographic sheet  of the  area of the  in new york state from the first decades of the usgs


the usgs produces several national series of  which vary in  and extent with some wide gaps in coverage notably the complete absence of 1 50,000 scale topographic maps or their equivalent the largest  both in terms of scale and quantity  and best-known topographic series is the 7.5-minute 1 24,000 scale  a non-metric scale virtually unique to the united states each of these maps covers an area bounded by two lines of  and two lines of  spaced 7.5  apart nearly 57,000 individual maps in this series cover the    and areas of  near anchorage fairbanks and prudhoe bay the area covered by each map varies with the latitude of its represented location due to convergence of the meridians at lower latitudes near 30 north a 7.5-minute quadrangle contains an area of about 64 square miles  166km2  at 49 north latitude 49 square miles  127km2  are contained within a quadrangle of that size as a unique non-metric map scale the 1 24,000 scale naturally requires a separate and specialized  scale for plotting map positions in recent years budget constraints have forced the usgs to rely on donations of time by civilian volunteers in an attempt to update its 7.5-minute topographic map series and usgs stated outright in 2000 that the program was to be phased out in favor of   not to be confused with the  produced by the  one of whose bureaus is usgs  an older series of maps the 15-minute series was once used to map the contiguous 48 states at a scale of 1 62,500 but was discontinued some time ago for maps covering the continental united states each map was bounded by two  and two  spaced 15 minutes apartthe same area covered by four maps in the 7.5-minute series the 15-minute series at a scale of 1 63,360  one inch representing one mile  remains the primary topographic quadrangle for the state of alaska  and only for that particular state  nearly 3,000 maps cover 97 of the state the united states remains virtually the only developed country in the world without a standardized civilian topographic map series in the standard 1 25,000 or 1 50,000 metric scales making coordination difficult in border regions  the u.s military does issue 1 50,000 scale topo maps of the continental united states though only for use by members of its defense forces  the next-smallest topographic series in terms of scale is the 1 100,000 series these maps are bounded by two lines of longitude and two lines of latitude however in this series the lines of latitude are spaced 30 minutes apart and the lines of longitude are spaced 60 minutes which is the source of another name for these maps  the 30 x 60-minute quadrangle series each of these quadrangles covers the area contained within 32 maps in the 7.5-minute series the 1 100,000 scale series is unusual in that it employs the  primarily one centimeter on the map represents one kilometer of distance on the ground  spot elevations and horizontal distances are also specified in meters the final regular quadrangle series produced by the usgs is the 1 250,000 scale topographic series each of these quadrangles in the conterminous united states measures 1degree of latitude by 2degrees of longitude this series was produced by the u.s in the 1950s prior to the maps in the larger-scale series and consists of 489 sheets each covering an area ranging from 8,218 square miles  21,285km2  at 30 north to 6,222 square miles  16,115km2  at 49 north hawaii is mapped at this scale in quadrangles measuring 1 by 1 usgs topographic quadrangle maps are marked with grid lines and tics around the map collar which make it possible to identify locations on the map by several methods including the  measurements of longitude and latitude the  and  method within the  and  in both the  and the  other specialty maps have been produced by the usgs at a variety of scales these include  maps maps of special interest areas such as the  and areas of scientific interest a number of internet sites have made these maps available on the web for affordable commercial and professional use because works of the u.s.government are in the  it is also possible to find many of these maps for free at various locations on the internet  map images are available from the usgs as   drgs  in addition to digital data sets based on usgs maps notably   dlgs  and   dems  in 2015 the usgs unveiled the topoview website a new way to view their entire digitized collection of over 178,000 maps from 18842006 the site is an interactive map of the united states that allows users to search or move around the map to find the usgs collection of maps for a specific area users may then view the maps in great detail and download them if desired the national map and u.s topo 
in 2008 the usgs abandoned traditional methods of surveying revising and updating topographic maps based on aerial photography and field checks today s u.s topo quadrangle  1 24,000  maps are mass-produced using automated and semiautomated processes with cartographic content supplied from the national gis database in the two years from june 2009 to may 2011 the usgs produced nearly 40,000 maps more than 80 maps per work day only about two hours of interactive work are spent on each map mostly on text placement and final inspection  there are essentially no field checks or field inspections to confirm map details while much less expensive to compile and produce the revised digital u.s topo maps have been criticized for a lack of accuracy and detail in comparison to older generation maps based on aerial photo survey and field checks as the digital databases were not designed for producing general purpose maps data integration can be a problem when retrieved from sources with different resolutions and collection dates man-made features once recorded by direct field observation are not in any public domain national database and are frequently omitted from the newest generation digital topo maps including windmills mines and mineshafts water tanks fence lines survey marks parks recreational trails buildings boundaries pipelines telephone lines power transmission lines and even railroads additionally the digital map s use of existing software may not properly integrate different feature classes or prioritize and organize text in areas of crowded features obscuring important geographic details as a result some have noted that the u.s topo maps currently fall short of traditional topographic map presentation standards achieved in maps drawn from 1945 to 1992 usgs hydrologic instrumentation facility 
the hydrologic instrumentation facility  hif  has four sections within its organizational structure  the field services section which includes the warehouse repair shop and engineering unit  the testing section which includes the hydraulic laboratory testing chambers and water quality laboratory  the information technology section which includes computer support and the drafting unit  and the administrative section the hif was given national responsibility for the design testing evaluation repair calibration warehousing and distribution of hydrologic instrumentation distribution is accomplished by direct sales and through a rental program the hif supports data collection activities through centralized warehouse and laboratory facilities the hif warehouse provides hydrologic instruments equipment and supplies for usgs as well as other federal agencies  ofa  and usgs cooperators the hif also tests evaluates repairs calibrates and develops hydrologic equipment and instruments the hif hydraulic laboratory facilities include a towing tank jet tank pipe flow facility and tilting flume in addition the hif provides training and technical support for the equipment it stocks the engineering group seeks out new technology and designs for instrumentation that can work more efficiently be more accurate and or be produced at a lower cost than existing instrumentation hif works directly with  to help them produce products that will meet the mission needs of the usgs for instrument needs not currently met by a vendor the engineering group designs tests and issues contracts to have hif designed equipment made sometimes hif will patent a new design in the hope that instrument vendors will buy the rights and mass-produce the instrument at a lower cost to everyone usgs publications
