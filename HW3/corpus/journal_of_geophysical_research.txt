history 
the journal was originally named terrestrial magnetism by the american geophysical union s president  in 1896 it was entitled terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity from 18991948 in 1980 three specialized sections were established  a  space physics b  solid earth and c  oceans subsequently further sections have been added  d  atmospheres in 1984 e  planets in 1991 f  earth surface in 2003 and g  biogeosciences in 2005 sections 
the scopes of the current seven sections published as separate issues are 

a  space physics covers  and  physics planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres interplanetary and external solar physics  and  physics b  solid earth focuses on the physics and chemistry of the  and the liquid  of the earth   marine geology geophysics chemistry and physics of       and  c  oceans covers physical biological and chemical  d  atmospheres covers atmospheric properties and processes including the interaction of the atmosphere with other components of the earth system e  planets covers the geology geophysics geochemistry atmospheres biology and dynamics of the      and   planetary origins  and planetary detection studies of the earth are included when they concern exogenic effects or the comparison of the earth to other planets f  earth surface focuses on the physical chemical and biological processes that affect the form and function of the surface of the solid earth over all temporal and spatial scales including   and     mass movements   and  activity   and   and surface manifestations of  and  g  biogeosciences focuses on the interface between  and the  and attempts to understand the functions of the earth system across multiple spatial and temporal scales 
each of the sections has one or more editors who are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president of the american geophysical union for terms of three to four years each editor can in turn appoint associate editors according to the editor-in-chief of jgr-space physics  with the switch to wiley the separate sections of jgr were given distinct issn numbers this means that in a couple of years each section of jgr will have its own impact factor 
abstracting and indexing 
the journal is indexed by      and several  indexes it published 2995 articles in 2010 according to the  the journal has a 2010  of 3.303 ranking it 15th out of 165 journals in the category  geosciences multidisciplinary  journal of geophysical researchatmospheres was also the 6th most cited publication on  between 1999 and 2009 notable articles
