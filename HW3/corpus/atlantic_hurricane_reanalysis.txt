reanalyzed 


the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project of the  seeks to correct and add new information about past  it was started around 2000 to update  the official  database for the  which has become outdated since its creation due to various systematic errors introduced into the database over time this effort has involved reanalyses of ship observations from the   icoads  as well as reanalyses done by other researchers over the years it has been ongoing as of 2016 and should last another four years

errors 
hurdat contains a number of errors which need to be corrected such demonstrated by the outliers in the a pressure vs wind speed graph of datapoints in the database  right  some of these errors have existed since the database s creation during  s  where it was used to help produce probabilities of tropical cyclone-induced winds in critical areas such as cape kennedy  now   new information 
a significant amount of new data for systems between 1851 and 1886 became available after a major basin-wide reanalysis in 1996 a project led by jose fernandez-paratagas with the collaboration of henry diaz the new data was constructed using old newspaper articles and the hemispheric  series hurricane histories for individual states had been constructed by the 1990s as well which proposed new storms and increased the knowledge of tropical cyclones already in the database due to this profusion of relevant information not included in hurdat and evolving definitions for  and  over the decades the project was started around 2000 to update the official database since then the international comprehensive ocean-atmosphere data set has been utilized to check for older ship reports which were either not utilized nor available to previous researchers incompleteness of dataset 
as early as 1957 it was recognized that an increasing trend in the number of tropical cyclones each season in the atlantic basin was at least partially tied to increasing observations and better records by analyzing the density of ship tracks over time it has been estimated that between 1900 and 1966 an average of two storms per year are missing from hurdat this is mainly due to a lack of satellite imagery and lack of reconnaissance aircraft prior to 1943 an additional storm per year is likely missing prior to the advent of new technologies these technologies include satellite-derived  winds satellite-derived temperature profile information and robert hart s cyclone phase space diagrams which have led to a recent increase in tropical cyclone detection quikscat was launched in 1999 and has been credited with allowing  to be named during the  the last two help determine whether or not a  is an   or tropical cyclone  noted that the efforts to reanalyze the atlantic hurricane database

will not be able to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken researchers cannot assume that the atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s moreover newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002 thus large long-term  trends  in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to any real change in the climate in which they develop 
the  report from 2007 noted on older datasets  the historical record typically records the central pressure and the maximum winds but these turn out not to be physically consistent in older records mainly prior to about the early 1970s however attempts at mutual adjustments result in increases in some years and decreases in others with little effect on overall trends  however scientist also point out that many storms remain under reported especially those not making landfall or staying in the open ocean the emerging studies of geological proxies in  however can help to bring more trends to light by for instance assessing sediments proxies from storm surge progress 




 over  as a category 5 hurricane


the project ranks the year 1914 as the quietest hurricane season ever for the atlantic basin with just one tropical storm the project has currently reanalyzed storms from the period 1886 to 1955 and has extended hurdat back to 1851  in 2001 data for the years 18511885 were added to the official database from the fernndez-partags series of publications also a paleotempestology conference was held at the  which proposed to increase the scope of hurdat from a starting year of 1851 to a start of 1800 the conference also discussed ways of exchanging information for the inclusion of older  such as via  or a wikipedia-style website while the reanalysis has mostly proceeded sequentially notable exceptions have been made for the reanalysis of some significant tropical cyclones in 2002 for the tenth anniversary of  the reanalysis was completed for the hurricane which upgraded the cyclone to a  hurricane in 2014 a similar reanalysis was completed for  work by michael chenoweth in collaboration with cary mock increased knowledge of tropical cyclones in the  for 1750 to 1786 chenoweth conducted a basin-wide reassessment for old source material from the 1700 to 1855 period by using  mainly in the form of ship reports newspapers and various diaries and journals from the region around the  future efforts in other basins 




typhoon freda in  database as 100 knots  190km h  while  were 115 knots  213km h 


there is agreement within  circles of doing an  atlantic-style  reanalysis for other ocean basins some efforts are underway to start similar reanalyses across the western and eastern north  but are likely to take longer to complete this is due to the need for coordination between the multiple  which have the responsibility for tracking and forecasting tropical cyclones across that ocean during february 2016 the nhc released the  s reanalysis which was the first system outside the atlantic basin to be reassessed using methods developed for the atlantic reanalysis process
