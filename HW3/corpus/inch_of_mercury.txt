early american barometer calibrated in inches of mercury


inch of mercury  inhg and  hg  is a  for  it is still used for  in   and  in the  it is the pressure exerted by a column of  of 1 inch  25.4mm  in height at the  conversion to metric units depends on the temperature of mercury and hence its density  typical conversion factors are 

aircraft  measure the relative pressure difference between the lower ambient pressure at altitude and a calibrated reading on the ground within the united states and canada these readings are provided in inches of mercury ground readings vary with weather and along the route of the aircraft as it travels so current readings are relayed periodically by air traffic control aircraft operating at higher altitudes  at or above what is called the  which varies by country  set their barometric  to a standard pressure of 29.92inhg  1atm   29.92inhg  or 1013.25  1hpa   1  regardless of the actual sea level pressure the resulting altimeter readings are known as    with  also use inches of mercury to measure  which is indicative of engine power produced in automobile racing particularly  and   inches of mercury was the unit used to measure  inlet pressure however the inch of mercury is still used today in car performance modification to measure the amount of vacuum within the engine s intake manifold this can be seen on boost vacuum gauges in  and refrigeration inhg is often used to describe  inches of mercury vacuum  or pressures below ambient atmospheric pressure for recovery of refrigerants from air conditioning and refrigeration systems as well as for leak testing of systems while under a vacuum and for dehydration of refrigeration systems the low-side gauge in a refrigeration gauge manifold indicates pressures below ambient in  inches of mercury vacuum   inhg  down to a 30inhg vacuum inches of mercury is also used in automotive cooling system vacuum test and fill tools a technician will use this tool to remove air from modern automotive cooling systems test the systems ability to hold vacuum and subsequently refill using the vacuum as suction for the new coolant typical minimum vacuum values are between 22 and 27inhg in older literature an  inch of mercury  is based on the height of a column of mercury at 60f  15.6c
