issn encoded in an ean-13 barcode with sequence variant 0 and issue number5






example of an issn encoded in an ean-13 barcode with explanation note  mod10 in the image should be mod11 





issn expanded with sequence variant 0 to a  and encoded in an  barcode with an  add-on designating issue number 13


an international standard serial number  issn  is an eight-digit  used to  a  the issn is especially helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title issn are used in ordering cataloging interlibrary loans and other practices in connection with serial literature the issn system was first drafted as an   iso   in 1971 and published as iso 3297 in 1975 iso subcommittee  is responsible for maintaining the standard when a serial with the same  is published in more than one  a different issn is assigned to each media type for example many serials are published both in  and  the issn system refers to these types as print issn  p-issn  and electronic issn  e-issn  respectively conversely as defined in iso 3297 2007 every serial in the issn system is also assigned a linking issn  issn-l  typically the same as the issn assigned to the serial in its first published medium which links together all issns assigned to the serial in every medium

code format 
the format of the issn is an eight digit code divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers as an  it can be represented by the first seven digits the last code digit which may be 0-9 or an x is a  formally the general form of the issn code  also named  issn structure  or  issn syntax  can be expressed as follows 

nnnn-nnnc
where n is in the set  0,1,2,...,9  a digit character and c is in  0,1,2,...,9,x 

or by a   pcre   

^\d 4\d 3  
the issn of the journal hearing research for example is 0378-5955 where the final 5 is the check digit that is c 5 to calculate the check digit the following algorithm may be used 

calculate the sum of the first seven digits of the issn multiplied by its position in the number counting from the rightthat is 8 7 6 5 4 3 and 2 respectively 






the  11 of this sum is then calculated  divide the sum by 11 and determine the remainder 






if there is no remainder the check digit is 0 otherwise the remainder value is subtracted from 11 to give the check digit 




5 is the check digit c 

for calculations an upper case x in the check digit position indicates a check digit of 10  like a   
to confirm the check digit calculate the sum of all eight digits of the issn multiplied by its position in the number counting from the right  if the check digit is x then add 10 to the sum  the modulus 11 of the sum must be 0 there is an online issn checker that can validate an issn based on the above algorithm code assignment 
issn codes are assigned by a network of issn national centres usually located at  and coordinated by the  based in  the international centre is an  created in 1974 through an agreement between  and the french government the international centre maintains a database of all issns assigned worldwide the isds register  international serials data system  otherwise known as the issn register at the end of 2016 the issn register contained records for 1,943,572 items comparison with other identifiers 
issn and  codes are similar in concept where isbns are assigned to individual  an isbn might be assigned for particular issues of a serial in addition to the issn code for the serial as a whole an issn unlike the isbn code is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title containing no  as to the  or its  for this reason a new issn is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change since the issn applies to an entire serial a new identifier the   sici  was built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes articles or other identifiable components  like the   media vs content 
separate issns are needed for serials in different media  except reproduction   thus the  and  versions of a serial need separate issns also a  version and a  version of a serial require different issns since two different media are involved however the same issn can be used for different file formats  e.g  and   of the same online serial this  media-oriented identification  of serials made sense in the 1970s in the 1990s and onward with personal computers better screens and the web it makes sense to consider only content independent of media this  content-oriented identification  of serials was a  during a decade but no issn update or initiative occurred a natural extension for issn the unique-identification of the articles in the serials was the main demand application an alternative serials  contents model arrived with the  and its application the   doi  as issn-independent initiative consolidated in the 2000s only later in 2007 issn-l was defined in the new issn standard  iso 3297 2007  as an  issn designated by the issn network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media  availability 
the issn register is not freely available for interrogation on the web but is available by subscription there are several routes to the identification and verification of issn codes for the public 

the print version of a serial typically will include the issn code as part of the publication information most serial websites contain issn code information derivative lists of publications will often contain issn codes  these can be found through on-line searches with the issn code itself or serial title  permits searching its catalog by issn by entering  issn issn code in the query field one can also go directly to an issn s record by appending it to  https www.worldcat.org issn  e.g  this does not query the issn register itself but rather shows whether any worldcat library holds an item with the given issn 
use in urns 
an issn can be encoded as a   urn  by prefixing it with  urn issn  for example  could be referred to as  urn issn 0953-4563  urn namespaces are case-sensitive and the issn namespace is all caps if the checksum digit is  x  then it is always encoded in uppercase in a urn problems 
the util urns are  but issn is media-oriented 

issn is not unique when the concept is  a journal is a set of contents generally copyrighted content  the same journal  same contents and same copyrights  have two or more issn codes a urn needs to point to  unique content   a  unique journal  as a  set of contents  reference  examples   has an issn for print 0028-0836 and another for the same content on the web 1476-4687  only the oldest  0028-0836  is used as a  as the issn is not unique the  needed to create prior to 2007 the nlm unique id  jid  issn does not offer  like a   doi  or an urn does so the doi is used as a urn for articles with  for historical reasons  no need for an issn s existence example  the doi name  10.1038 nature13777  can be represented as an http string by https dx.doi.org 10.1038 nature13777 and is   resolved  to the current article s page  but there is no issn online service like http dx.issn.org  to resolve the issn of the journal  in this sample   that is a kind of https dx.issn.org 1476-4687 redirecting to the journal s home 
a unique urn for serials simplifies the search recovery and delivery of data for various services including in particular  and  issn-l  see  below  was created to fill this gap issn variants and labels 
there are two most popular media types that adopted special labels  indicating below in italics  and one in fact issn-variant with also an optional label all are used in standard  context like  and the labels also frequently as abbreviations print issn 
p-issn is a standard label for  print issn  the issn for the   paper  version of a serial usually it is the  default media  so the  default issn  electronic issn 
e-issn  or eissn  is a standard label for  electronic issn  the issn for the   online  version of a serial linking issn 
issn-l is a  for all versions of the serial containing the same  across different media as defined by iso 3297 2007 the  linking issn  issn-l  provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource the issn-l is one issn number among the existing issns so does not change the use or assignment of  ordinary  issns  it is based on the issn of the first published medium version of the publication if the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time the issn of the print version is chosen as the basis of the issn-l with issn-l is possible to designate one single issn for all those media versions of the title the use of issn-l facilitates search retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like    or  road
