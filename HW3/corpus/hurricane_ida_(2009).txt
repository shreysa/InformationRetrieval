hurricane ida originated from a weak  that reached the western caribbean on november1 2009 by november2 the system spawned an  north of  which moved very little over the following days the low became increasingly organized within a favorable environment that allowed deep  to develop by november4 the low had become sufficiently organized for the   nhc  to classify it as tropical depression eleven at this time the tropical depression was situated just southwest of  convective  became increasingly defined throughout the day and six hours after becoming a tropical depression the system intensified into tropical storm ida light  allowed ida to quickly intensify as it slowly tracked towards the nicaraguan coastline late on november4 microwave satellite imagery depicted an  featured forming within the storm the storm tracked west-northwestward in response to a weak  over the north-central caribbean sea and a weak  over the southwestern   these features were also responsible for ida s slow forward motion early on november 5 the storm intensified into a  on the  as it passed near the  at approximately 1117 utc the center of ida made  near rio grande nicaragua with winds of 80mph  130km h  after the hurricane moved inland the high mountains of nicaragua caused the convection associated with the hurricane to diminish resulting in rapid weakening roughly 18 hours after landfall ida weakened to a tropical depression as it turned northward over  late on november6 ida re-emerged over water entering the northwestern caribbean sea upon moving back over water the storm quickly began to redevelop with convection increasing around the center of circulation early on november7 ida restrengthened into a tropical storm as it tracked just west of due north very warm  ahead of the system would have allowed for substantial intensification  however wind shear over the area quickly increased resulting in modest strengthening later that day the storm turned northwestward in response to a strong trough over  and a mid-level ridge extending from the southeast united states to  as ida neared the  an eye redeveloped and the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane by the morning of november8 the storm had attained  with winds of 100mph  155km h

late on november8 ida attained its peak intensity with winds of 105mph  165km h  and a  of 975mbar  hpa  28.79inhg  shortly thereafter increasing wind shear and forward speed caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm only a small area of convection remained near the center by the morning of november9 despite the strong shear the storm quickly re-organized attaining hurricane status for a third time during the afternoon based on readings from a nearby oil platform and reconnaissance data it was determined that ida attained its secondary peak intensity near the southeast coast of  with winds of 85mph  140km h  however this intensification was short-lived as a combination of increasing wind shear and decreasing sea-surface temperatures induced weakening to a tropical storm within three hours by the morning of november 10 all of ida s convection appeared displaced to the northeast and the forward motion of the storm slowed substantially additionally the storm had begun to undergo an  near the  shortly before making landfall near  the storm completed its extratropical transition ida crossed  shortly thereafter and maximum winds decreased below gale-force after slowly tracking eastward for several hours the surface circulation of ida dissipated over the  late on november 10 however energy from the storm led to the formation of a new low off the coast of  this new low quickly intensified and became  that caused substantial damage throughout the  by november12 the system attained a minimum pressure of 992mbar  hpa  29.29inhg  along with winds of 65mph  100km h  the extratropical low weakened the following day and moved out to sea after stalling along the north carolina coastline the remnants of the cyclone persisted through november17 by which time it had moved over  preparations
