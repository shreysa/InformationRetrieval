sea spray


sea spray refers to  particles that are formed directly from the  mostly by ejection into the atmosphere by bursting bubbles at the air-sea interface

composition 
  ssa  contains both inorganic salts and organic matter from the ocean it is thought that the amount of organic matter transferred to ssa depends on microbiological activity the organic matter in sea spray can contain  or even microbes themselves like bacteria and viruses effects 
salt spray is largely responsible for  of metallic objects near the coastline as the salts accelerate the corrosion process in the presence of abundant atmospheric  and moisture salts do not dissolve in air directly but are suspended as fine  or dissolved in microscopic airborne water droplets chemical resistance 
the  is the notable measure of material endurance particularly if the material will be used outdoors and must perform in a  or otherwise critical role these results are often of great interest to the  whose products may suffer extreme acceleration of corrosion and subsequent failure due to the salt water environment see also
