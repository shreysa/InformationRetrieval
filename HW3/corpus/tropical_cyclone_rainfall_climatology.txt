a tropical cyclone rainfall climatology is developed to determine rain storm size and degree of vertical wind shear one of the most significant threats from  is heavy rainfall large slow moving and non-sheared tropical cyclones produce the heaviest rains the intensity of a tropical cyclone appears to have little bearing on its potential for rainfall over land but satellite measurements over the last several years show that more intense tropical cyclones produce noticeably more rainfall over water flooding from tropical cyclones remains a significant cause of fatalities particularly in low-lying areas

while inland  is common to tropical cyclones there are factors which lead to excessive rainfall from tropical cyclones slow motion as was seen during  and  can lead to high amounts of rainfall the presence of mountains hills near the coast like across much of   the      and  acts to magnify rainfall potential due to forced upslope flow into the mountains strong upper level forcing from a trough moving through the westerlies and its associated  as was the case during  can lead to high amounts even from systems moving at an average forward motion larger tropical cyclones drop more rainfall as they precipitate upon one spot for a longer time frame than average or small tropical cyclones a combination of two of these factors could be especially crippling as was seen during  in  during the 2005 season flooding related to slow-moving  s broad circulation led to 1,6622,000 deaths general distribution within a tropical cyclone 

 was the first to investigate  distribution around tropical cyclones in the early 1900s he found that a larger proportion of rainfall falls in advance of the center  or eye  than after the center s passage with the highest percentage falling in the right front quadrant father vies of  found that some tropical cyclones have their highest rainfall rates in the rear quadrant within a training  non-moving  inflow band normally as a tropical cyclone intensifies its heavier rainfall rates become more concentrated around its center rainfall is found to be heaviest in tropical cyclone s inner core whether it be the  or  within a degree latitude of the center with lesser amounts farther away from the center most of the rainfall in tropical cyclones is concentrated within its radius of gale-force  34knots 39mph 63km h  winds rainfall is more common near the center of tropical cyclones overnight over land outer bands are more active during the heating of the day which can act to restrict inflow into the center of the cyclone recent studies have shown that half of the rainfall within a tropical cyclone is stratiform in nature the chart to the right was developed by riehl in 1954 using meteorological equations that assume a gale radius of about 140 miles  230km  a fairly symmetric cyclone and does not consider topographic effects or vertical wind shear local amounts can exceed this chart by a factor of two due to topography wind shear tends to lessen the amounts below what is shown on the table relation to storm size 


the relative sizes of   and the united states 

larger tropical cyclones have larger rain shields which can lead to higher rainfall amounts farther from the cyclone s center this is generally due to the longer time frame rainfall falls at any one spot in a larger system when compared to a smaller system some of the difference seen concerning rainfall between larger and small storms could be the increased sampling of rainfall within a larger tropical cyclone when compared to that of a compact cyclone  in other words the difference could be the result of a statistical problem slow looping motion on rainfall magnitude 
storms which have moved slowly or loop over a succession of days lead to the highest rainfall amounts for several countries riehl calculated that 33.97inches  863mm  of rainfall per day can be expected within one-half degree or 35miles  56km  of the center of a mature tropical cyclone many tropical cyclones progress at a forward motion of 10knots which would limit the duration of this excessive rainfall to around one-quarter of a day which would yield about 8.50inches  216mm  of rainfall this would be true over water within 100miles  160km  of the coastline and outside topographic features as a cyclone moves farther inland and is cut off from its supply of warmth and moisture  the ocean  rainfall amounts from tropical cyclones and their remains decrease quickly vertical wind shear impact on rainfall shield 
vertical  forces the rainfall pattern around a tropical cyclone to become highly asymmetric with most of the precipitation falling to the left and downwind of the shear vector or downshear left in other words southwesterly shear forces the bulk of the rainfall north-northeast of the center if the wind shear is strong enough the bulk of the rainfall will move away from the center leading to what is known as an exposed circulation center when this occurs the potential magnitude of rainfall with the tropical cyclone will be significantly reduced effect of interaction with frontal boundaries upper level troughs 
as a  interacts with an upper-level  and the related  a distinct northern area of precipitation is seen along the front ahead of the axis of the upper level trough this type of interaction can lead to the appearance of the heaviest rainfall falling along and to the left of the tropical cyclone track with the precipitation streaking hundreds of miles or kilometers downwind from the tropical cyclone the stronger the upper trough picking up the tropical cyclone the more significant the left of track shift in the rainfall distribution tends to be mountains 
moist air forced up the slopes of coastal hills and mountain chains can lead to much heavier rainfall than in the coastal plain this heavy rainfall can lead to landslides which still cause significant loss of life such as seen during  in  global distribution 




global tropical cyclone rainfall in 2005


globally tropical cyclone rainfall is more common across the northern hemisphere than across the southern hemisphere this is mainly due to the normal annual tropical cyclone distribution as between half and two-thirds of all tropical cyclones form north of the equator rainfall is concentrated near the 15th parallel in both hemispheres with a less steep dropoff seen with latitude across the northern hemisphere due to the stronger warm water currents seen in that hemisphere which allow tropical cyclones to remain tropical in nature at higher latitudes than south of the equator in the southern hemisphere rainfall impacts will be most common between january and march while north of the equator tropical cyclone rainfall impacts are more common between june and november  receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons united states tropical cyclone rainfall statistics
