expedition 2  also called iss eo-2  was the second long-duration  aboard the  immediately following  its three-person crew stayed aboard the station from march to august 2001 in addition to station maintenance the crew assisted in several station assembly missions welcomed the first   and conducted some scientific experiments the crew consisted of one  commander  and two american flight engineers  and  the three had been to the station briefly in the previous year during the 10-day mission  in may 2000 the expedition 2 crew was brought to the station aboard   during mission  the expedition s increment began when discovery docked on 10 march 2001 bringing expedition 1 to an end in addition to the space shuttle flights which brought the crew to and from the station there were two visiting space shuttle missions and one soyuz mission which docked with the iss during expedition two in august discovery returned to rotate the long-duration crews again bringing the crew of  the expedition 2 increment ended when discovery undocked from the station on 20 august 2001

crew 
all three crew members had visited the international space station together in may 2000 aboard  in addition to this spaceflight the expedition 2 commander yuri usachev also had two other spaceflights both of which were long-duration missions aboard    and   in addition to sts-101 flight engineer susan helms had three other spaceflights all of which were space shuttle missions      james voss also had three other spaceflights all of which were space shuttle missions      prime crew

expedition 2 the second long-term crew for the international space station arrived in march 2001 they returned to earth on mission  22 august 2001 after having spent 163 days aboard the station and 167 days in space only voss performed a spacewalk on sts-101 along with  during this expedition research facilities launched to the space station included a human research facility two express  expedite the processing of experiments to the space station  racks one of which contains the active rack isolation system and the payload equipment restraint system they also prepared the destiny laboratory to enable upcoming experiments to be conducted a major focus was on gaining a better understanding of how to protect crew members from radiation while working and living in space radiation exposure in high doses over long periods of time can damage human cells and cause cancer or injury to the central nervous system launch and docking

the three-member expedition 2 crew successfully launched on 8 march 2001 on space shuttle discovery during mission  they docked with the international space station on 10 march but the expedition 2 increment didn t begin until the previous crew undocked from the station on 18 march sts-100

the first visitors to the station during expedition 2 was the crew of  when they docked space shuttle  with the iss on 21 april 2001 they spent eight days docked to the station the primary objective of this mission was to deliver and install the  on the iss which is a robotic arm similar to the  which is used on some space shuttle flights a later mission in 2002  would deliver a movable base platform which would allow the canadarm2 to have a larger range iss ep-1 

on the day after the space shuttle undocked the russian spacecraft  docked to the station carrying two cosmonauts with previous spaceflight experience as well as  the first ever  this 8 day mission is sometimes referred to as iss ep-1 iss-2s soyuz 2 taxi flight or simply by its launching spacecraft soyuz tm-32 the commander of this visiting mission was  cosmonaut  who had previously been on two long-duration missions aboard the space station  in the 1990s the other crew member of iss ep-1 was  who had one other spaceflight  which was a visiting mission to mir launched with the spacecraft  baturin s first mission occurred during the long-duration mission  so he and musabayev had already been in space together prior to iss ep-1  in fact both were landed with the spacecraft  in august 1998 sts-104

in july space shuttle  docked with the station for an eight-day visit as a part of  the main objective of this mission was to install the  onto the station the sts-104 crew performed 3  
first spacewalk  joint airlock installation

the first spacewalk occurred on 15 july and focused on installation of the quest joint airlock the spacewalkers helped as susan helms using the station s robotic arm lifted the new station airlock from atlantis  payload bay and moved it to the station s unity module during much of the 5 hour 59 minute spacewalk jim reilly worked from a foot platform attached to the end of the shuttle s robotic arm operated by janet kavandi after the spacewalk crew members inside the station attached connections to the airlock to prevent thermal damage 
second spacewalk

the second spacewalk which happened on 18 july lasted 6 hours 29 minutes the internal hatches between the shuttle and station were closed at the end of flight day 6 so atlantis  cabin pressure could be lowered in preparation for the second spacewalk the major objective was to attach and connect an oxygen and a nitrogen tank susan helms operated the station arm to lift the tanks from the shuttle s payload bay and maneuver them to the new airlock at the airlock mike gernhardt and jim reilly latched the tanks in place and connected cables and hoses the spacewalkers were able to get ahead of schedule and also install another oxygen tank leaving only one tank to be connected on the third spacewalk 
third spacewalk

the third spacewalk which occurred on 21 july was the first spacewalk based out of the new quest joint airlock and lasted 4 hours 2 minutes primary objective was to install the final nitrogen tank outside the airlock this spacewalk tested a new protocol developed by former commercial diver mike gernhardt  essentially exercising while breathing oxygen to purge nitrogen from the spacewalkers  bodies undocking and landing
