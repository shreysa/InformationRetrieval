force 12 at sea


the beaufort scale  is an  measure that relates  to observed conditions at sea or on land its full name is the beaufort wind force scale

history 
the scale was devised in 1805 by irish-born   later  sir francis beaufort  a  officer while serving on  the scale that carries beaufort s name had a long and complex evolution from the previous work of others  including  the century before  to when beaufort was hydrographer of the navy in the 1830s when it was adopted officially and first used during the voyage of  under captain  later to set up the first   met office  in britain giving regular weather forecasts in the early 19th century naval officers made regular weather observations but there was no standard scale and so they could be very subjective one man s  stiff breeze  might be another s  soft breeze  beaufort succeeded in standardising the scale 



sir francis beaufort


the initial scale of thirteen classes  zero to twelve  did not reference  numbers but related qualitative wind conditions to effects on the sails of a  then the main ship of the  from  just sufficient to give steerage  to  that which no canvas sails could withstand  the scale was made a standard for ship s log entries on royal navy vessels in the late 1830s and was adapted to non-naval use from the 1850s with scale numbers corresponding to cup  rotations in 1916 to accommodate the growth of steam power the descriptions were changed to how the sea not the sails behaved and extended to land observations rotations to scale numbers were standardized only in 1923    later sir george simpson  director of the   was responsible for this and for the addition of the land-based descriptors the measure was slightly altered some decades later to improve its utility for  today many countries have abandoned the scale and use the  based units m s or km h instead  but the  warnings given to the public are still approximately the same as when using the beaufort scale the beaufort scale was extended in 1946 when forces 13 to 17 were added however forces 13 to 17 were intended to apply only to special cases such as  nowadays the extended scale is only used in taiwan and mainland china which are often affected by  internationally wmo manual on marine meteorological services  2012 edition  defined the beaufort scale only up to force 12 and there was no recommendation on the use of the extended scale wind speed on the 1946 beaufort scale is based on the  

v   0.836 b3 2 

where v is the equivalent wind speed at 10 metres above the sea surface and b is beaufort scale number for example b   9.5 is related to 24.5m s which is equal to the lower limit of  10 beaufort  using this formula the highest winds in hurricanes would be 23 in the scale today hurricane-force winds are sometimes described as beaufort scale 12 through 16 very roughly related to the respective category speeds of the  by which actual  are measured where category 1 is equivalent to beaufort 12 however the extended beaufort numbers above 13 do not match the saffirsimpson scale category 1  on the  and  scales also begin roughly at the end of level 12 of the beaufort scale but are independent scales although the torro scale wind values are based on the 3 2 power law relating wind velocity to beaufort force  in the scale are for conditions in the open ocean not along the shore modern scale 

the wind speeds in different units are not mathematically equivalent  e.g 1219km h is not equivalent to 812mph and both are not equivalent to 710 knots the reason is that the beaufort scale is not an exact nor an objective scale it was based on visual and subjective observation of a ship and of the sea the corresponding integral wind speeds were determined later but the values in different units were never made equivalent the scale is used in the  broadcast on  in the united kingdom and in the sea area forecast from  the irish meteorological service met ireann issues a  small craft warning  if winds of beaufort force 6  mean wind speed exceeding 22 knots  are expected up to 10 nautical miles offshore other warnings are issued by met ireann for irish coastal waters which are regarded as extending 30 miles out from the coastline and the irish sea or part thereof   gale warnings  are issued if winds of beaufort force 8 are expected   strong gale warnings  are issued if winds of beaufort force 9 or frequent gusts of at least 52 knots are expected   storm force warnings  are issued if beaufort force 10 or frequent gusts of at least 61 knots are expected   violent storm force warnings  are issued if beaufort force 11 or frequent gusts of at least 69 knots are expected   hurricane force warnings  are issued if winds of greater than 64 knots are expected this scale is also widely used in the netherlands germany greece china taiwan hong kong malta and macau although with some differences between them taiwan uses the beaufort scale with the extension to 17 noted above china also switched to this extended version without prior notice on the morning of 15 may 2006 and the extended scale was immediately put to use for   and  retain force 12 as the maximum in the united states winds of force 6 or 7 result in the issuance of a  with force 8 or 9 winds bringing about a  force 10 or 11 a   a   being issued instead of the latter two if the winds relate to a   and force 12 a   or  if related to a tropical cyclone  a set of red warning flags  daylight  and red warning lights  night time  is displayed at shore establishments which coincide with the various levels of warning in canada maritime winds forecast to be in the range of 6 to 7 are designated as  strong  8 to 9  gale force  10 to 11  storm force  12  hurricane force  appropriate wind warnings are issued by environment canada s meteorological service of canada  strong wind warning gale  force wind  warning storm  force wind  warning and hurricane-force wind warning these designations were standardized nationally in 2008 whereas  light wind  can refer to 0 to 12 or 0 to 15 knots and  moderate wind  12 to 19 or 16 to 19 knots depending on regional custom definition or practice prior to 2008 a  strong wind warning  would have been referred to as a  small craft warning  by environment canada similar to us terminology  canada and the usa have the great lakes in common
