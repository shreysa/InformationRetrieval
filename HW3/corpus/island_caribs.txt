caribs traded with the eastern  of the  the caribs produced the  products which  found in tano communities none of the insular amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland the caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors they appeared to have owed their dominance in the caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare according to floyd  the question arose in  time whether indians could be enslaved and  had ruled against it at about the same time however   and other explorers voyaging along the  had been attacked by indians with poisoned arrows  all such indians were considered caribs  which took a considerable toll of spanish lives these attacks and the evidence some of the perpetrators at least were cannibals provided the rationale for the decree authorizing enslavement of caribs  on 3 june 1511 king  declared war on the caribs island caribs nevertheless mostly succeeded in keeping their islands unoccupied by spaniards in the 17th century island caribs were displaced with a great loss of life by a new wave of european invaders  french and english most fatalities resulted from  infectious diseases such as  which they had no natural  to as well as warfare in 1660 france and england signed with island caribs the  that stipulated that caribs would evacuate all the lesser antilles except for  and  which were recognized as reserves however the english would later ignore the treaty and ended up annexing both islands in 1763 to this date a small population of around 3,000 caribs survives in the  in northeast dominica the  black caribs   later known as   of    has some  yellow caribs  as well  were descended from a group of   who were  from shipwrecks of slave ships as well as slaves who escaped here  and his men from  jumped off of the leapers hill  rather than face slavery under the french invaders and have served as an iconic representation of the caribs spirit of resistance they intermarried with the carib and formed the last native culture to resist the british it was not until 1795 that   deported the black caribs to  island off  their descendants continue to live there today and are known as the  ethnic group carib resistance delayed the settlement of dominica by europeans the black carib communities that remained in st vincent and dominica retained a degree of autonomy well into the 19th century the last known speakers of island carib died in the 1930s and the language is  people

the island caribs were of a medium height but in general were of a taller stature than the arawaks they were described as being stronger than the arawaks reportedly due to the emphasis placed on training for warfare their skin was of a brown hue and they were usually naked and it was very rare for their loins to be covered the women painted their skin with a red dye called roucou which they used to make fantastical decorations of many colours the eyes of the females were usually circled with black the men also painted their bodies and on occasion wore feathered headdresses jewellery through their lips and jewellery through their noses they wore the caracoli which was a necklace of small bones along with the teeth of defeated enemies from which a crescent shaped ornament was suspended the caracoli was worn to represent the courage of the wearer religion 
the caribs are believed to have been  as the spanish began to colonise the caribbean area they wanted to convert the natives to  the religion practised by the caribs had elements similar to the ancestor worship of the  they believed in an evil spirit called maybouya who had to be placated for an individual to avoid harm the chief function of their  called buyeis was to heal the sick with herbs and to cast spells  piai  which would keep maybouya at bay the buyeis were very important and underwent special training instead of becoming warriors as they were held to be the only people who could avert evil they were treated with great respect their ceremonies were accompanied with sacrifices as with the arawaks and other  the caribs smoked  in the rituals of their religion social organization 
early carib culture was  women carried out the domestic duties of rearing young children processing and producing food and clothing and cultivating the land for farming including sowing and harvesting men carried out the tasks of hunting for food and protecting women and children from attack by other warring tribes in the 17th century europeans reported that the women with their children lived in separate houses from men a custom recorded among other south american tribes 
the women were highly revered and held substantial socio-political power island carib society was reputedly more socially  than tano society although there were village chiefs and war leaders there were no large states or multi-tiered aristocracy the local  unit may have been the  dwellings populated by men or women typically run by one or more  reporting to an island  food 
the caribs ate almost the same foods as the tainos they did not farm very well so they relied less on maize and cassava but still knew how to grow them although they were not very good farmers the caribs were excellent fishermen and were not afraid of long voyages their diet consisted of lots of protein  they ate manatees ducks iguanas and fish among other foods the caribs had many myths and beliefs about diet  they believed that eating pig would give one small beady eyes they also believed eating turtle meat made one stupid in doing so they deprived themselves of the protein that was easily available in the west indies they also believed that eating crab before a voyage would bring storms the caribs seasoned their food with pepper but did not use salt couii and taumalin were pepper sauces taumalin was made from pepper lemon juice and the green meat of crab the caribs made ouicou  a cassava beer with a strong alcoholic content and got very drunk on festivals and holidays although their diet was not quite so varied as that of the arawaks it was well balanced prepared in many different ways and served with different seasonings music

the  word karibna meant  person  it became the origin of the english  cannibal  although among the caribs it was apparently associated with rituals related to the eating of war enemies there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both arawak and other amerindian groups such as the carib and tupinamba 
the caribs had a tradition of keeping bones of their ancestors in their houses  such as pre  and  described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants the caribs have been described as vicious and violent people in the history of the people who battled against other tribes italian explorer  was killed and said to have been eaten by carib natives on what is now   french west indies  in 1528  before called karukera by the amerindian people which means the island of beautiful waters  during his third voyage to north america after exploring   and the  historian william riviere has described most of the cannibalism as related to war rituals kalinago canoe project 
in 1997  artist jacob frederick and  artist aragorn dick read joined forces and set out to build a traditional canoe based on the fishing canoes still used in dominica  and  the project consisted of a return voyage by canoe to the orinoco delta to meet up with the kalinago tribes still living in those parts on the way a cultural assessment was carried out and ties were reestablished with the remaining communities along the island chain a documentary the quest of the carib canoe was made by the bbc the expedition sent shock waves through the lesser antilles as it made the local governments aware of the presence and the struggles for cultural survival of the kalinago see also
