geometric terms of location describe directions or positions relative to the shape of an object these terms are used in descriptions of engineering physics and other sciences as well as ordinary day to day discourse though these terms by themselves may be somewhat ambiguous they are usually used in a context in which their meaning is clear for example when referring to a  it is clear what is meant by axial or radial directions or in a  one may similarly infer a sense of orientation by the forces or other vectors represented examples 
common geometric terms of location are 

adjacent  next to
axial  along the center of a round body or the  of a body
azimuthal or circumferential  following around a curve or  of an object for instance the pattern of cells in  varies along the azimuth of the experiment collinear  in the same line
degree of freedom  axis direction see 
lateral  spanning the width of a body lineal  following along a given path the shape of the path is not necessarily straight  compare to   for instance a length of rope might be measured in lineal  or  see  longitudinal  spanning the length of a body the distinction between width and length may be unclear out of context orthogonal  at right angles to a line or more generally on a different axis parallel  in the same direction
perpendicular  at right angles to synonym to orthogonal
radial  along a direction pointing along a  from the center of an object or perpendicular to a curved path tangential  intersecting a curve at a point and parallel to the curve at that point transverse  orthogonal to a specified direction such as a particle trajectory or an axis of rotation
