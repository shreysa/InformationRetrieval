season summary 








this season twenty-two  formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline all but two of them became tropical storms or hurricanes in the eastern pacific region   to north america  nineteen tropical depressions formed of which seventeen became tropical storms nine further intensifying into hurricanes and five ultimately reaching major hurricanes of category3 intensity or higher on the  these numbers are slightly above the long-term averages of fifteen tropical storms nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes in the  s    to the   three depressions two tropical storms and one hurricane formed overall there were eleven tropical cyclones eight tropical storms five hurricanes and three major hurricanes that formed or entered the central pacific region these numbers are well above the long-term average of four tropical cyclones two hurricanes one tropical storm and two depressions the exceptionally high activity was contributed to by an  ongoing at the time the only named storm to make landfall this year was  which killed four people in western mexico and forced over 400 to be evacuated other notable storms include hurricane olivia a high-end category 4 system the three category5 hurricanes   and  both john and hurricane li existed in two of the three   east and west  of the pacific ocean this season marked the end of the northeastern pacific s most recent active period which began in  and includes the  beginning in  multi-decadal factors switched to a phase that suppresses pacific hurricane activity since then pacific hurricane seasons have generally been below normal  the lone abnormally active season since then was in  where a strong el nino event was observed the 1994 pacific hurricane season set several records first three hurricanes reached category5 intensity on the  setting a record later tied in  hurricane john lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on earth in recorded history eleven tropical cyclones entered or formed in the central pacific a record shared with the  until  broke the record finally of the four most intense hurricanes recorded in the central pacific three of them occurred this season 
the season began with the formation of tropical depression one-e on june 18 and ended with the dissipation of tropical depression nona on october 26 no named systems formed in may three in june four in july five in august six in september two in october and none in november the total length of the season from the formation of the first depression to the dissipation of the last was 130 days 
  ace  is a measure of how active a hurricane season is it is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours summing the results and dividing that total by 104 as a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm tropical depressions are not included in these tables for all storms ace is given to three  the ace in the east pacific proper   to north america  is given  the ace in the central pacific  the  to   is given in brackets the table includes the ace for li and john only during those storm s time east of the dateline their ace west of the dateline is part of the totals of the  the  uses ace to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal near-normal and below-normal it defines below-normal as having an ace less than 95 104kt2 kt2  it defines above normal as having an ace above 150 104kt2 along with the numbers of any two of the following above average  tropical storms  15  hurricanes  9  or major hurricanes  4  it defines near-normal as having an ace between 100 104kt2 and 150 104kt2 or an ace above 150 104kt2 with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average  tropical storms  15  hurricanes  9  or major hurricanes  4  this season has a total of seventeen tropical storms nine hurricanes and five major hurricanes the total ace of this season is 185 104kt2 this qualifies this season as above-normal systems
