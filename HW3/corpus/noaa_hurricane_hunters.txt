the noaa hurricane hunters are a group of aircraft that work under the   aoc  located at  in   the aircraft operations center is under the office of marine and aviation operations  omao  which is a branch of the   noaa  which is in turn an agency of the  the aoc resided at  from january 1993 to june 2017 noaa announced that in 2013  data will be transmitted from hurricane hunter aircraft in   this should help forecasters more quickly analyze storm conditions and could improve  model forecast accuracy by 10 to 15 percent

about 
the noaa hurricane hunters conduct research using special aircraft in order to support noaa s mission of predicting changes in the earth s environment and managing coastal and marine resources aoc crews fly through  to help forecasters and scientists gather both operational and research data in addition the crews conduct a number of other research projects  including ocean wind studies winter storm research thunderstorm research coastal erosion and air chemistry flights to name a few aircraft 
 uses two lockheed  turboprops to fly through hurricanes and a  which flies around the upper fringes of storms to get a read on steering currents the noaa also uses light aircraft for some of its research in conjunction with jim henson productions noaa s p-3s are nicknamed   n42rf  and   n43rf  the g-iv  n49rf  is nicknamed  wp-3 




noaa s lockheed wp-3d orion


the wp-3 was designed to tolerate large amounts of turbulence since it flies through the eyes of hurricanes the wp-3 can be thought of as a flying research lab as it is equipped to take atmospheric measurements one of the most distinctive parts of the wp-3 is the prominent black circular belly radome staffed with 18 to 20 crew members including pilots and scientists a normal hurricane reconnaissance or research mission can last from 910 hours while a surveillance  fix  mission  mission will typically last 8 hours often in rotation with  flights from the  s   53 wrs  at six-hour intervals most often the scientists and crew aboard the aircraft deploy  with  which collect and transmit data as they descend toward the ocean once this data is received and checked by the crew it is sent to the noaa  for analysis other data is collected and transmitted by request personnel on board include pilots navigators engineers technicians and flight    past projects use the wp-3 have included  observation over south america a  and  in the midwest and ocean wind satellite verification missions over the northern atlantic and pacific g-iv 




noaa s gulfstream iv-sp


the g-iv is a high altitude jet that can fly up to 45,000 feet the g-iv crew is similar to the wp-3 and includes pilots engineers technicians and a   
the g-iv flies around the periphery of both tropical and winter storms including hurricanes and drops sondes in order to gather data about the surrounding environment this information is used to help predict the path of hurricanes dropsonde transmissions are collected and checked by an on-board flight director who then transmits the data to the   ncep  and the   nhc  for analysis the g-iv serves the ncep winter storm reconnaissance program in order to better predict the location and intensity of winter storms that affect the united states the program was started by   national center for environmental prediction  during winter storm reconnaissance air chemistry measurements are also taken from the upper  these flights are typically flown from   or   see also
