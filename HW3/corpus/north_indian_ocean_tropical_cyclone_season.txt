sub-basins 
the bay of bengal located in the northeast of the indian ocean is responsible for the formation of some of the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclones in the world the basin is abbreviated bob by the   imd  the official  of the basin the bay of bengal s coast is shared among     and western part of  the strongest storm in the bay was the  as the remnants impact  and  sometimes the  also issues full advisories to cyclonic storms in this basin the arabian sea is a sea located in the northwest of the indian ocean tropical cyclones in the basin are abbreviated arb by the   imd  the official   rsmc  of the basin the arabian sea s coast is shared among        and   are characteristic of the arabian sea and responsible for the yearly cycling of its waters in summer strong winds blow from the southwest to the northeast bringing rain to the  during the winter the winds are milder and blow in the opposite direction from the northeast to the southwest cyclones are rare in the arabian sea but the basin can produce strong tropical cyclones  was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the basin  however storms typically do not reach a high intensity in the arabian sea due to the small amount of water dry air coming from the desert of the  and unfavorable wind shear from the monsoon history of the basin 
the systematic scientific studies of tropical systems in the  and  was started during the 19th century by  piddington utilised meteorological logs of vessels that navigated the seas and published a series of memoirs in the journal of the asiatic society of bengal between 1839 and 1858 these memoirs gave accounts and tracks of individual storms in the bay of bengal and the arabian sea during the 2004 post monsoon season the imd started to name tropical cyclones within the basin with the first one named  during september 2004 during 2015 a modification to the intensity scale took place with the imd and wmo calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90 knots  165km h  105mph  and 120 knots  220km h  140mph  an extremely severe cyclonic storm water temperatures in the arabian sea are typically warm enough to allow for  year round although strong  from the  prevents formation in the summer months and limits intensity other times of the year an increase in air pollution since the 1930s caused a decrease in the wind shear allowing storms to have become stronger since 1979 years

1970s
a study analyzing the spring season of tropical cyclones in the bay of bengal found increases in both premonsoon precipitation and tropical cyclone intensity as a result of enhanced large-scale monsoon circulation after 1979 the deepened monsoon trough in the bay of bengal not only affects cyclone frequency and timing but also acts to direct more cyclones towards myanmar increased  likely contributed to such a regional climate change
