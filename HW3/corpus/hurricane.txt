the near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air rotating rapidly around a  while also flowing radially inwards at the outer edge of the storm air may be nearly calm  however due to the earths rotation the air has non-zero  as air flows radially inward it begins to   counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere  in order to  at an inner radius air begins to ascend to the  this radius is typically coincident with the inner radius of the  and has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm  consequently it is known as the  once aloft air flows away from the storm s center producing a shield of  the previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly   wind speeds are low at the center increase rapidly moving outwards to the radius of maximum winds and then decay more gradually with radius to large radii however the wind field often exhibits additional spatial and temporal variability due to the effects of localized processes such as  and horizontal  in the vertical direction winds are strongest near the surface and decay with height within the troposphere eye and center

on occasion tropical cyclones may undergo a process known as rapid deepening a period in which the minimum sea-level pressure of a tropical cyclone decreases by 42mb in a 24-hour period in order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place  must be extremely high  near or above 30c 86f  and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not upwell cooler waters to the surface  must be low  when wind shear is high the  and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted usually an  in the upper layers of the  above the storm must be present as wellfor extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the  of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently size

there are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size the most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind the radius of 34-knot wind  i.e   the radius of outermost closed    and the radius of vanishing wind an additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone s relative  field decreases to 1105 s1 on earth tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes from 1002,000 kilometres  621,243mi  as measured by the radius of vanishing wind they are largest on average in the northwest pacific ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern pacific ocean basin if the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two   222km  138mi  then the cyclone is  very small  or a  midget  a radius of 36 latitude degrees  333670km  207416mi  is considered  average sized   very large  tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8degrees  888km  552mi  observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity  i.e maximum wind speed  radius of maximum wind latitude and maximum potential intensity size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm all else equal a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time additionally a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher  due to the combination of longer wind  longer duration and enhanced  the upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the  of the atmosphere which at low latitudes is 15,00018,000 metres  50,00060,000ft  physics and energetics




tropical cyclones exhibit an overturning circulation where air inflows at low levels near the surface rises in thunderstorm clouds and outflows at high levels near the tropopause 

the  wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components  a  primary circulation  and a   the primary circulation is the rotational part of the flow  it is purely circular the secondary circulation is the overturning  in-up-out-down  part of the flow  it is in the  and vertical directions the primary circulation is larger in magnitude dominating the surface wind field and is responsible for the majority of the damage a storm causes while the secondary circulation is slower but governs the  of the storm secondary circulation  a carnot heat engine
a tropical cyclone s primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of  from the  surface which ultimately  into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to  the energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric  first inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water  i.e   at the temperature of the warm ocean surface  during evaporation the ocean cools and the air warms  second the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content  latent heat is simply converted to  during   third air outflows and loses heat via  to space at the temperature of the cold  finally air  and warms at the outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content the first and third legs are nearly  while the second and fourth legs are nearly  this in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the  the carnot perspective provides an  on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain scientists estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at the rate of 50 to 200  1018j  per day equivalent to about 1pw  1015watt  this rate of energy release is equivalent to 70 times the  of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity or to exploding a 10  every 20minutes primary circulation  rotating winds
the primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the  by the secondary circulation  on a rotating planet  is given by



where  is the   is the azimuthal  i.e rotating  wind speed and  is the radius to the axis of rotation the first term on the right hand side is the component of planetary angular momentum that projects onto the local vertical  i.e the axis of rotation  the second term on the right hand side is the relative angular momentum of the circulation itself with respect to the axis of rotation because the planetary angular momentum term vanishes at the equator  where    tropical cyclones rarely  within 5 of the equator as air flows radially inward at low levels it begins to rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum similarly as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius resulting in an upper-level  the result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong  at low levels and a strong  near the   from  this corresponds to a system that is warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes  i.e warm-core  from  the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface maximum potential intensity
due to surface friction the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum thus the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source  evaporation  and sink  friction  of energy for the system this fact leads to the existence of a theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can attain because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed  just as climbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day  there is a positive feedback on energy input into the system known as the wind-induced surface heat exchange  wishe  feedback this feedback is offset when frictional dissipation which increases with the cube of the wind speed becomes sufficiently large this upper bound is called the maximum potential intensity  and is given by



where  is the temperature of the sea surface  is the temperature of the outflow    is the enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air  j kg  and  and  are the surface    of enthalpy and momentum respectively the surface-air enthalpy difference is taken as  where  is the saturation  of air at sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure and  is the enthalpy of boundary layer air overlying the surface the maximum potential intensity is predominantly a function of the background environment alone  i.e without a tropical cyclone  and thus this quantity can be used to determine which regions on earth can support tropical cyclones of a given intensity and how these regions may evolve in time specifically the maximum potential intensity has three components but its  is due predominantly to the variability in the surface-air enthalpy difference component  derivation
a tropical cyclone may be viewed as a  that converts input  energy from the surface into  that can be used to do  against surface friction at equilibrium the rate of net energy production in the system must equal the rate of energy loss due to frictional dissipation at the surface i.e 


the rate of energy loss per unit surface area from surface friction  is given by



where  is the density of near-surface air  kg m3  and  is the near surface wind speed  m s  the rate of energy production per unit surface area  is given by



where  is the heat engine efficiency and  is the total rate of heat input into the system per unit surface area given that a tropical cyclone may be idealized as a  the carnot heat engine efficiency is given by



heat  enthalpy  per unit mass is given by



where  is the heat capacity of air  is air temperature  is the latent heat of vaporization and  is the concentration of water vapor the first component corresponds to  and the second to  there are two sources of heat input the dominant source is the input of heat at the surface primarily due to evaporation the bulk aerodynamic formula for the rate of heat input per unit area at the surface  is given by



where  represents the enthalpy difference between the ocean surface and the overlying air the second source is the internal sensible heat generated from frictional dissipation  equal to   which occurs near the surface within the tropical cyclone and is recycled to the system 


thus the total rate of net energy production per unit surface area is given by



setting  and taking   i.e the rotational wind speed is dominant  leads to the solution for  given above this derivation assumes that total energy input and loss within the system can be approximated by their values at the radius of maximum wind the inclusion of  acts to multiply the total heat input rate by the factor  mathematically this has the effect of replacing  with  in the denominator of the carnot efficiency an alternative definition for the maximum potential intensity which is mathematically equivalent to the above formulation is



where cape stands for the   is the cape of an air parcel lifted from saturation at sea level in reference to the environmental   is the cape of the boundary layer air and both quantities are calculated at the radius of maximum wind characteristic values and variability on earth
on earth a characteristic temperature for  is 300 k and for  is 200 k corresponding to a carnot efficiency of  the ratio of the surface exchange coefficients  is typically taken to be 1 however observations suggest that the drag coefficient  varies with wind speed and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature hurricane additionally  may vary at high wind speeds due to the effect of  on evaporation within the boundary layer a characteristic value of the maximum potential intensity  is 80 metres per second  180mph  290km h  however this quantity varies significantly across space and time particularly within the  spanning a range of 0 to 100 metres per second  0 to 224mph  0 to 360km h  this variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium      as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate these processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature  and underlying ocean dynamics  background near-surface wind speed and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating the nature of this modulation is complex particularly on climate time-scales  decades or longer  on shorter time-scales variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water however this relationship is indirect via the large-scale dynamics of the tropics  the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on  is weak in comparison interaction with the upper ocean




chart displaying the drop in surface temperature in the  as hurricanes  and  passed over


the passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially which can influence subsequent cyclone development this cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters this effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops  this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes  cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage all these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days

the formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood while six factors appear to be generally necessary tropical cyclones may occasionally form without meeting all of the following conditions in most situations  of at least 26.5c  79.7f  are needed down to a depth of at least 50m  160ft  waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms for tropical transitioning cyclones  i.e   a water temperature of at least 22.5c  72.5f  has been suggested another factor is rapid cooling with height which allows the release of the  that powers a tropical cyclone high humidity is needed especially in the lower-to-mid   when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop low amounts of  are needed as high shear is disruptive to the storm s circulation tropical cyclones generally need to form more than 555km  345mi  or five degrees of latitude away from the  allowing the  to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center and creating a circulation lastly a formative tropical cyclone needs a preexisting system of disturbed weather tropical cyclones will not form spontaneously low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts associated with the  can create favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis by initiating tropical disturbances locations
most tropical cyclones form in a worldwide band of thunderstorm activity near the  referred to as the intertropical front  itf  the   itcz  or the  another important source of atmospheric instability is found in  which contribute to the development of about 85 of intense tropical cyclones in the atlantic ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the eastern pacific the majority forms between 10 and 30degrees of latitude away of the equator and 87 forms no farther away than 20degrees north or south because the coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator where the effect is weakest however it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as  and  did in 2001 and 2004 respectively movement
the movement of a tropical cyclone  i.e its  track  is typically approximated as the sum of two terms   steering  by the background environmental wind and  beta drift  environmental steering
environmental steering is the dominant term conceptually it represents the movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions similar to  leaves carried along by a stream  physically the winds or  in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts  the flow associated with the storm itself and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place in this way tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as  of the storm by the local environmental flow this environmental flow is termed the  steering flow  climatologically tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west  on the equatorial side of the a persistent high-pressure area over the world s subtropical oceans in the tropical north atlantic and northeast pacific oceans the trade winds steer  westward from the african coast toward the caribbean sea north america and ultimately into the central pacific ocean before the waves dampen out these waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region in contrast in the  and western pacific in both hemispheres tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the inter-tropical convergence zone and the monsoon trough additionally tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems such as extratropical cyclones beta drift
in addition to environmental steering a tropical cyclone will tend to drift slowly poleward and westward a motion known as  beta drift  this motion is due to the superposition of a vortex such as a tropical cyclone onto an environment in which the  varies with latitude such as on a sphere or  it is induced indirectly by the storm itself the result of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and its environment physically the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center because air must conserve its  this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center the combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward this effect occurs even if there is zero environmental flow multiple storm interaction
main article  
a third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the interaction of multiple tropical cyclones when two cyclones approach one another their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems depending on their separation distance and strength the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge when the two vortices are of unequal size the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction and the smaller vortex will orbit around it this phenomenon is called the fujiwhara effect after  interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies

 an example of a strongly  tropical cyclone in the  basin during 


a tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several different ways one such way is if it moves over land thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself quickly losing strength most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two or evolve into extratropical cyclones there is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water such as with  if it remains over mountains for even a short time weakening will accelerate many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall this rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides as was the case with  around honduras in october 1998 without warm surface water the storm cannot survive a tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below 26.5c  79.7f  this will cause the storm to lose its tropical characteristics such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center and become a remnant  these remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing their identity this dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern north pacific weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the center  this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone in addition its interaction with the main belt of the westerlies by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into  this transition can take 13days even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated it can still have tropical storm force  or occasionally hurricane typhoon force  winds and drop several inches of rainfall in the  and  such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach the west coast of north america these phenomena can also affect europe where they are known as    extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from 1995 a cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure becoming a larger area of low pressure this can strengthen the resultant system although it may no longer be a tropical cyclone studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones artificial dissipation

intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon and  being relatively sparse are rarely available on the site of the storm itself in general surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area or if there is a nearby ship real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated for this reason there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by  capturing  and  images from space usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals as a storm approaches land it can be observed by land-based   radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm s location and intensity every several minutes  measurements in real-time can be taken by sending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone in the atlantic basin these flights are regularly flown by united states government  the aircraft used are  hercules and  orions both four-engine  cargo aircraft these aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements the aircraft also launch  inside the cyclone these sondes measure temperature humidity pressure and especially winds between flight level and the ocean s surface a new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted  a small drone aircraft was flown through tropical storm ophelia as it passed virginia s eastern shore during the 2005 hurricane season a similar mission was also completed successfully in the western pacific ocean this demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare

 tropical depression  redirects here for the filipino reggae band see  for the ep by elephant micah see  a tropical depression or tropical low is a tropical disturbance that has a clearly defined  with  of less than 34kn  39mph  63km h  within the southern hemisphere the depression can have gale force or stronger winds in one or more quadrants but not near the centre tropical storm
 tropical storm  redirects here for the album see   a tropical storm is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds between 34 knots  63km h  and 64 knots  119km h  at this point the distinctive cyclonic shape starts to develop although an eye is not usually present government weather services first assign names to systems that reach this intensity  thus the term named storm  although tropical storms are less intense than a hurricane they can produce significant damage the shear force of winds can blow off shingles and air borne objects can cause damage to power lines roofing and siding more dangerous is the heavy rainfall causing inland flooding hurricane or typhoon
main articles    and 
a hurricane or typhoon  sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone as opposed to a depression or storm  is a system with sustained winds of at least 34m s  66kn  76mph  120km h  a cyclone of this intensity tends to develop an eye an area of relative calm  and lowest atmospheric pressure  at the center of circulation the eye is often visible in satellite images as a small circular cloud-free spot surrounding the eye is the  an area about 16 kilometres  9.9mi  to 80 kilometres  50mi  wide in which the strongest  and winds circulate around the storm s center maximum sustained winds in the strongest tropical cyclones have been estimated at about 95m s  185kn  210mph  340km h  


origin of storm terms




 endures a typhoon in 2005


the word typhoon which is used today in the northwest pacific may be derived from  fn    similar in  and   which in turn originates from     a monster from  associated with storms the related  word tufo used in portuguese for typhoons is also derived from typhon   for  folk etymology     the word is also similar to chinese  tifng   simplified chinese   traditional chinese     fng   wind   toifung  in   taif    in japanese and  taepung    in korean the word hurricane used in the north atlantic and northeast pacific is derived from huracn the spanish word for the   storm god  this god is believed by scholars to have been at least partially derived from the  creator god  huracan was believed by the maya to have created dry land out of the turbulent waters the god was also credited with later destroying the  wooden people  the precursors to the   with an immense storm and flood huracan is also the source of the word orcan another word for a particularly strong  naming
main articles   and 
the practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of naming the system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems in a brief form that is readily understood and recognized by the public the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the  meteorologist  who named systems between 1887 and 1907 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of  for the western pacific formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the  as well as the  and  at present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts watches and warnings since the systems can last a week or longer and more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same time the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is being described names are assigned in order from predetermined  with one three or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65km h  40mph  depending on which basin it originates however standards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the western pacific while tropical cyclones have to have a significant amount offorce winds occurring around the center before they are named within the  the names of significant tropical cyclones in the north atlantic ocean pacific ocean and australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name notable tropical cyclones

atlantic multidecadal oscillation timeseries 18562013


while the number of storms in the atlantic has increased since 1995 there is no obvious global trend  the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 8710  between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually  however the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins primarily in the southern hemisphere while noting that a significant downward trend in tropical cyclone numbers has been identified for the region near australia  based on high quality data and accounting for the influence of the el nio-southern oscillation  in spite of that there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing  stated  records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes the energy released by the average hurricane  again considering all hurricanes worldwide  seems to have increased by around 70 in the past 30years or so corresponding to about a 15 increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60 increase in storm lifetime 
atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially as evidenced by the fact that five of the ten  have occurred since 1990 according to the   recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has been caused largely by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions  political scientist  et al  2008  normalized mainland us hurricane damage from 19002005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage the 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades the decade 19962005 was the second most damaging among the past 11 decades with only the decade 19261935 surpassing its costs often in part because of the threat of hurricanes many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism  therefore the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances the combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes therefore experts regard the early data as suspect the number and strength of atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 5070year cycle also known as the  nyberg et al reconstructed atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging 35 major hurricanes per year and lasting 4060years and six other averaging 1.52.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 1020years these periods are associated with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation throughout a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing dampening the number of major hurricanes by 12 per year although more common since 1995 few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 197094 destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960 including many major  hurricanes twenty-one atlantic tropical storms formed in  a record only recently exceeded in  which saw 28 storms tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 190025  however many intense storms formed during 187099 during the  19 tropical storms formed of which a record 4 occurred after november 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s  however many struck in the early 19th century including an  that made a direct hit on  some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as  in strength these active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the atlantic basin before the satellite era began in 1960 tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one a ship reported a voyage through the storm or a storm hit land in a populated area proxy records based on  research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the  coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia few major hurricanes struck the gulf coast during 30001400 bc and again during the most recent millennium these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 bc and 1000 ad when the gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 35 times this millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the  which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the  according to the azores high hypothesis an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the gulf of mexico coast and the atlantic coast during the quiescent periods a more northeasterly position of the azores high would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the atlantic coast during the hyperactive period more hurricanes were steered towards the gulf coast as the azores high was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the caribbean such a displacement of the azores high is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in  around 3200  years bp and a change towards more humid conditions in the  during the late-holocene as more moisture was pumped up the  through the gulf coast preliminary data from the northern atlantic coast seem to support the azores high hypothesis a 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in  suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 5001000years just as the gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium

the 2007  report noted many observed changes in the climate including atmospheric composition global average temperatures ocean conditions and others the report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict in addition the report considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity p.j webster and others published in 2005 an article in  examining the  changes in tropical cyclone number duration and intensity  over the past 35years the period when satellite data has been available their main finding was although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding the north  there was a great increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones according to 2006 studies by the   the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth s climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  studies published since 2008 by  from mit indicate that  is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity in an article in  kerry emanuel stated that potential hurricane destructiveness a measure combining hurricane strength duration and frequency  is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature reflecting well-documented climate signals including  in the north atlantic and north pacific and global warming  emanuel predicted  a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century  research reported in the september 3 2008 issue of nature found that the strongest tropical cyclones are getting stronger in particular over the north atlantic and indian oceans wind speeds for the strongest tropical storms increased from an average of 225km h  140mph  in 1981 to 251km h  156mph  in 2006 while the ocean temperature averaged globally over all the regions where tropical cyclones form increased from 28.2c  82.8f  to 28.5c  83.3f  during this period a 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods storm surge and terrestrial flooding  rivers  and projects an increase  related cyclone types
