the  in  around  february 2010 the iss is in a micro-g environment 

the term micro-g environment  also g often referred to by the term microgravity  is more or less a synonym for  and zero-g but indicates that  are not quite zero just very small the symbol for microgravity g was used on the insignias of  flights  and  because these flights were devoted to microgravity research in

absence of gravity 
a  stationary  micro-g environment would require travelling far enough into deep space so as to reduce the effect of gravity by  to almost zero this is the simplest in conception but requires traveling an enormous distance rendering it most impractical for example to reduce the gravity of the earth by a factor of one million one needs to be at a distance of 6 million kilometers from the earth but to reduce the gravity of the sun to this amount one has to be at a distance of 3.7 billion kilometers  the gravity due to the rest of the  is already smaller than one millionth of the gravity on earth so we do not need to move away further from its   thus it is not impossible but it has only been achieved so far by four    and  part of the   and  part of the   and they did not return to earth to reduce the gravity to one thousandth of that on earth s surface one needs to be at a distance of 200,000km 
at a distance relatively close to earth  less than 3000km  gravity is only slightly reduced as an object orbits a body such as the earth gravity is still attracting objects towards the earth and the object is accelerated downward at almost 1g because the objects are typically moving laterally with respect to the surface at such immense speeds the object will not lose altitude because of the curvature of the earth when viewed from an orbiting observer other close objects in space appear to be floating because everything is being pulled towards earth at the same speed but also moving forward as the earth s surface  falls  away below all these objects are in free fall not zero gravity compare the  free fall 
what remains is a micro-g environment moving in  i.e there are no forces other than gravity acting on the people or objects in this environment to prevent air drag making the free fall less perfect objects and people can free-fall in a capsule that itself while not necessarily in free fall is accelerated as in free fall  this can be done by applying a force to compensate for air drag alternatively free fall can be carried out in space or in a vacuum tower or shaft the two cases that can be distinguished are that where the situation is only temporary because after some time the earth s surface is or would be reached and the case where the situation can go on indefinitely a temporary micro-g environment exists in a   in a tower or shaft  a  e.g with a  and in an airplane such as used by  s reduced gravity research program aka the  and by the  a temporary micro-g environment is applied for training of astronauts for some experiments for filming movies and for recreational purposes a micro-g environment for an indefinite time while also possible in a spaceship going to infinity in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit is most practical in an earth orbit this is the environment commonly experienced in the   etc while this scenario is the most suitable for scientific experimentation and commercial exploitation it is still quite expensive to operate in mostly due to launch costs tidal and inertial acceleration 
objects in orbit are not perfectly weightless due to several effects 

effects depending on relative position in the spacecraft 

because the force of gravity decreases with distance objects with non-zero size will be subjected to a  or a differential pull between the ends of the object nearest and furthest from the earth  an extreme version of this effect is   at   leo  altitudes the force differential is approximately 0.33 g m in a spacecraft in leo the  is greater on the side of the spacecraft furthest from the earth this is also a tidal force adding 0.17 g m to the first-mentioned effect 
 floating  objects in a spacecraft in leo are actually in independent orbits around the earth if two objects are placed side-by-side  relative to their direction of motion  they will be orbiting the earth in different orbital planes since all orbital planes pass through the center of the earth any two orbital planes intersect along a line therefore two objects placed side-by-side  at any distance apart  will come together after one quarter of a revolution if they are placed so they miss each other they will oscillate past each other with the same period as the orbit this corresponds to an inward acceleration of 0.17 g per meter horizontal distance from the center if they are placed one ahead of the other in the same orbital plane they will maintain their separation if they are placed one above the other  at different radii from the center of the earth  they will have different potential energies so the size eccentricity and period of their orbits will be different causing them to move in a complex looping pattern relative to each other gravity between the spacecraft and an object within it may make the object slowly  fall  toward a more massive part of it the acceleration is 0.007 g for 1000kg at 1m distance 

uniform effects  which could be compensated 

though very thin there is some air at orbital altitudes of 185 to 1,000km this atmosphere causes deceleration due to friction this could be compensated by a small continuous thrust but in practice the deceleration is only compensated from time to time so the small g-force of this effect is not eliminated the effects of the  and  are similar but directed away from the sun unlike the effect of the atmosphere it does not reduce with altitude 


commercial applications
in a   now obsolete  molten metal  such as  or   was dripped through a sieve into free fall with sufficient height  several hundred feet  the metal would be solid enough to resist impact  usually in a water bath  at the bottom of the tower while the shot may have been slightly deformed by its passage through the air and by impact at the bottom this method produced metal spheres of sufficient roundness to be used directly in  shells or to be refined by further processing for applications requiring higher accuracy high-quality crystals 
while not yet a commercial application there has been interest in growing  in micro-g as in a  or automated artificial  in an attempt to reduce crystal lattice defects such defect-free crystals may prove useful for certain microelectronic applications and also to produce crystals for subsequent
