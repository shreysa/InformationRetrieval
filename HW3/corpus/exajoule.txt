this article is about the unit of energy for other uses see  
the joule   symbol  j  is a  of  in the  it is equal to the energy transferred to  or  done on  an object when a  of one  acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one   1 newton metre or nm  it is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric  of one  passes through a  of one  for one second it is named after the english physicist   18181889  in terms firstly of base  and then in terms of other si units 



where kg is the  m is the  s is the  n is the  pa is the  w is the  c is the  and v is the  one joule can also be defined as 

the work required to move an  of one coulomb through an  of one volt or one  coulomb-volt   cv  this relationship can be used to define the volt the work required to produce one watt of  for one second or one  watt-second   ws   compare   3.6 megajoules  this relationship can be used to define the watt

usage 
this  unit is named after  as with every international system of units  si  unit named for a person the first letter of its  is   j  however when an si unit is spelled out in english it should always begin with a  letter  joule except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using  note that  degree   conforms to this rule because the  d  is lowercase.based on  section 5.2 confusion with newton metre 
main article  
in  the concept of   in some direction  has a close analog in the concept of   about some angle 

a result of this similarity is that the si unit for torque is the  which works out  to have the same  as the joule but they are not interchangeable the  has given the unit of  the name joule but has not given the unit of torque any special name hence it is simply the newton metre  nm   a compound name derived from its constituent parts the use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications the distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a   the  of a  force and a vector displacement by contrast torque is a vector  the  of a distance vector and a force vector torque and energy are related to one another by the equation



where e is energy  is  the  of  torque and  is the angle swept  in   since radians are dimensionless it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions practical examples 
one joule in everyday life represents approximately 

the energy required to lift a medium-size tomato  100g  1m vertically from the surface of the earth the energy released when that same tomato falls back down to the ground the energy required to accelerate a 1kg mass at 1 ms2 through a distance of 1m the  required to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 0.24c the typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1 60 s  approximately 17ms  the  of a 50kg human moving very slowly  0.2m s or 0.72km h  the kinetic energy of a 56g tennis ball moving at 6m s  22km h  the kinetic energy of an object with mass 1kg moving at 21.4m s the amount of electricity required to light a 1w  for 1s 
since the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kwh  kilowatt-hour  a kwh is thus 1000w  3600s   3.6mj  megajoules  multiples
