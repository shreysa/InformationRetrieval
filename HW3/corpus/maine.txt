etymology 
there is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name  maine  but the most likely origin is that the name was given by early explorers after the province of  in france whatever the origin the name was fixed for english settlers in 1665 when the english king s commissioners ordered that the  province of maine  be entered from then on in official records the state legislature in 2001 adopted a resolution establishing franco-american day which stated that the state was named after the former  other theories mention earlier places with similar names or claim it is a nautical reference to the mainland attempts to uncover the history of the name of maine began with james sullivan s 1795  history of the district of maine  he made the unsubstantiated allegation that the province of maine was a compliment to the queen of   who once  owned  the province of maine in france this was quoted by maine historians until the 1845 biography of that queen by agnes strickland established that she had no connection to the province of maine in france  further king charles i married henrietta maria in 1625 three years after the name maine first appeared on the charter a new theory put forward by carol b smith fisher in 2002 is that  chose the name in 1622 to honor the village where his ancestors first lived in england rather than the province in france  maine  appears in the  of 1086 in reference to the county of  which is today  just southeast of  the view generally held among british place name scholars is that mayne in dorset is  corresponding to modern   maen  plural  main  or  meini   some early spellings are  maine 1086 meine 1200 meines 1204 mayne 1236  today the village is known as  which is primitive welsh or brythonic  main  meaning rock or stone considered a reference to the many large  still present around little mayne farm half a mile northeast of broadmayne village the first known record of the name appears in an august 10 1622 land charter to sir ferdinando gorges and captain  english  veterans who were granted a large tract in present-day maine that mason and gorges  intend to name the   mason had served with the royal navy in the  where the chief island is called  a possible name derivation for these english sailors in 1623 the english naval captain  exploring the new england coast wrote   the first place i set my foote upon in new england was the  being ilands    in the sea above two leagues from the mayne  initially several tracts along the coast of new england were referred to as main or maine  cf the   a reconfirmed and enhanced april 3 1639 charter from england s king charles i gave sir ferdinando gorges increased powers over his new province and stated that it  shall forever hereafter be called and named the province or countie of maine and not by any other name or names whatsoever  maine is the only state whose name has exactly one syllable history

the original inhabitants of the territory that is now maine were algonquian-speaking  peoples including the     and  during the later king phillip s war many of these peoples would merge in one form or another to become the wabanaki confederacy aiding the  of massachusetts   the  of new york afterwards many of these people were driven from their natural territories but most of the tribes of maine continued unchanged until the american revolution before this point however most of these people were considered separate nations many had adapted to living in permanent iroquois inspired settlements while those along the coast tended to be semi-nomadic traveling from settlement to settlement on a yearly cycle they would usually winter inland   head to the coasts by summer
