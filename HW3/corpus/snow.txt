snow develops in clouds that themselves are part of a larger weather system the physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures the resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations thereof occasionally some plate-like dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present cloud formation
snow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems the most important of which is the low pressure area which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation two additional and locally productive sources of snow are lake-effect  also sea-effect  storms and elevation effects especially in mountains low pressure areas

freshly fallen snowflakes 

a snowflake consists of roughly 1019 water molecules which are added to its core at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground as a result snowflakes vary among themselves while following similar patterns snow crystals form when tiny  cloud droplets  about 10 in diameter   these droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than 18c  0f  because to freeze a few  in the droplet need to get together by chance to form an arrangement similar to that in an ice lattice then the droplet freezes around this  nucleus  in warmer clouds an aerosol particle or  ice nucleus  must be present in  or in contact with  the droplet to act as a nucleus ice nuclei are very rare compared to that cloud condensation nuclei on which liquid droplets form clays desert dust and biological particles can be nuclei artificial nuclei include particles of  and  and these are used to stimulate precipitation in  once a droplet has frozen it grows in the supersaturated environmentone where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point the droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air  vapor  onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of  or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the  the corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets  expense these large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass and may collide and stick together in clusters or aggregates these aggregates are snowflakes and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground although the ice is clear scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to  of the whole  of  by the small ice particles classification of snowflakes

snow accumulation on building roofs

in areas with trees utility distribution lines on poles are less susceptible to snow loads than they are subject to damage from trees falling on them felled by heavy wet snow elsewhere snow can accrete on power lines as  sleeves  of rime ice engineers design for such loads which are measured in kg m  lb ft  and power companies have forecasting systems that anticipate types of weather that may cause such accretions rime ice may be removed manually or by creating a sufficient short circuit in the affected segment of power lines to melt the accretions sports and recreation

snow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath many  thrive in snow including     and  such  are typically active at temperatures down to 5c  23f  invertebrates fall into two groups regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures  freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive the first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce  agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions some organisms  during the winter which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts the ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism small  are active beneath the snow among vertebrates  are active in snow at temperatures as low as 8c  18f  they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds among mammals those that remain active are typically smaller than 250 grams  8.8oz   are more likely to enter a torpor or be  whereas  are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow  store up to 3 kilograms  6.6lb  of food and  up to 20 kilograms  44lb  voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another s warmth on the surface     and  rely on these subsurface dwellers for food and often dive into the snowpack to find them extraterrestrial snow
extraterrestrial  snow  includes water-based precipitation but also precipitation of other compounds prevalent on other planets and moons in the  examples are 

on  observations of the  reveal that water-based snow crystals occur at high latitudes additionally  precipitates from clouds during the martian winters at the poles and contributes to a seasonal deposit of that compound which is the principal component of that  on  observations from the  reveal the presence a metallic substance which precipitates as   and leaves a highly reflective substance at the tops of venus s highest mountain peaks resembling terrestrial snow given the high temperatures on venus the leading candidates for the precipitate are  and  on  s moon   observations suggest the presence of  or some other form ofbased crystalline deposits
