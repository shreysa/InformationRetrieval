distinction between advection and convection 
the term advection sometimes serves as a synonym for  but technically convection covers the sum of transport both by  and by advection advective transport describes the movement of some quantity via the bulk flow of a fluid  as in a river or pipeline  meteorology 
in  and  advection often refers to the horizontal transport of some property of the atmosphere or  such as  humidity or salinity and convection generally refers to vertical transport  vertical advection  advection is important for the formation of   terrain-forced convection  and the precipitation of water from clouds as part of the  other quantities 
the advection equation also applies if the quantity being advected is represented by a  at each point although accounting for diffusion is more difficult the advection equation is the  that governs the motion of a conserved  as it is advected by a known  it is derived using the scalar field s  together with  and taking the  limit one easily visualized example of advection is the transport of ink dumped into a river as the river flows ink will move downstream in a  pulse  via advection as the water s movement itself transports the ink if added to a lake without significant bulk water flow the ink would simply disperse outwards from its source in a  manner which is not advection note that as it moves downstream the  pulse  of ink will also spread via diffusion the sum of these processes is called  the advection equation 
in cartesian coordinates the advection  is

 
where  is the  and  is the  operator  note that  are used here  the advection equation for a conserved quantity described by a   is expressed mathematically by a  





where  is the  operator and again  is the  frequently it is assumed that the flow is  that is the  satisfies



and  is said to be  if this is so the above equation can be rewritten as





in particular if the flow is steady then



which shows that  is constant along a  hence  so  doesn t vary in time if a vector quantity   such as a   is being advected by the    the advection equation above becomes 



here  is a  instead of the   solving the equation 




a simulation of the advection equation where u    sin t cos t  is solenoidal 

the advection equation is not simple to solve   the system is a  and interest typically centers on   shock  solutions  which are notoriously difficult for numerical schemes to handle  even with one space dimension and a constant  the system remains difficult to simulate the equation becomes



where  is the  being advected and  is the  component of the vector  treatment of the advection operator in the incompressible navier stokes equations 
according to zang numerical simulation can be aided by considering the  form for the advection operator 


where



and  is the same as above since skew symmetry implies only   this form reduces the  blow up  and  spectral blocking  often experienced in numerical solutions with sharp discontinuities  see boyd  using  these operators can also be expressed in other ways available in more software packages for more coordinate systems 





this form also makes visible that the  operator introduces error when the velocity field diverges solving the advection equation by numerical methods is very challenging and there is a large scientific literature about this see also
