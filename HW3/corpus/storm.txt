a storm is any disturbed state of an  or astronomical body s  especially affecting its surface and strongly implying  it may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong     and   a   heavy    rainstorm  heavy    strong winds   windstorm  or wind transporting some  through the  as in a   sandstorm etc storms have the potential to harm lives and property via  heavy  or  causing  or road impassibility   and vertical   however systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise such as skiing and snowmobiling 



 storms are often accompanied by violent winds and pass rapidly 

the  word comes from   sturmaz meaning  noise tumult

storms are created when a center of  develops with a system of  surrounding it this combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm  such as the  small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground resulting in smaller disturbances such as  and  types 




classic storm of summer in   

there are many varieties and names for storms 

 ice storms are one of the most dangerous forms of  when surface temperatures are below freezing but a thick layer of above-freezing air remains aloft rain can fall into the freezing layer and freeze upon impact into a glaze of ice in general 8 millimetres  0.31in  of accumulation is all that is required especially in combination with breezy conditions to start downing power lines as well as tree limbs ice storms also make unheated road surfaces too slick to drive upon ice storms can vary in time range from hours to days and can cripple small towns and large urban centers alike  there are varying definitions for blizzards both over time and by location in general a blizzard is accompanied byforce winds heavy snow  accumulating at a rate of at least 5 centimeters  2in  per hour  and very cold conditions  below approximately10 degrees celsius or 14f  lately the temperature criterion has fallen out of the definition across the united states
 a heavy fall of snow accumulating at a rate of more than 5 centimeters  2in  per hour that lasts several hours snow storms especially ones with a high liquid equivalent and breezy conditions can down tree limbs cut off power and paralyze travel over a large region coastal storm large  and or  that strike the coastal zone their impacts include  and 
ocean storm storm conditions out at sea are defined as having sustained winds of 48 knots  55mph or 90km h  or greater usually just referred to as a storm these systems can sink vessels of all types and sizes  firestorms are conflagrations which attain such intensity that they create and sustain their own wind systems it is most commonly a natural phenomenon created during some of the largest bushfires forest fires and wildfires the  is one example of a firestorm firestorms can also be deliberate effects of targeted explosives such as occurred as a result of the aerial   generate firestorms if high winds are not present  a small localized updraft of rising air wind storm a storm marked by high wind with little or no precipitation windstorm damage often opens the door for massive amounts of water and debris to cause further damage to a structure  and  are two type of windstorms high wind is also the cause of  in dry climates  sudden onset of wind increase of at least 16 knots  30km h  or greater sustained for at least one minute  an  with sustained winds between 34-48 knots  39-55mph or 6390km h   a thunderstorm is a type of storm that generates  and the attendant  it is normally accompanied by heavy  thunderstorms occur throughout the world with the highest frequency in   regions where there are conditions of high humidity and temperature along with atmospheric instability these storms occur when high levels of condensation form in a volume of unstable air that generates deep rapid upward motion in the atmosphere the heat energy creates powerful rising air currents that swirl upwards to the  cool descending air currents produce strong downdraughts below the storm after the storm has spent its energy the rising currents die away and downdraughts break up the cloud individual storm clouds can measure 210km across  a tropical cyclone is a storm system with a closed circulation around a centre of  fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and condenses the name underscores its origin in the  and their  nature tropical cyclones are distinguished from other cyclonic storms such as  and  by the heat mechanism that fuels them which makes them  warm core  storm systems 

tropical cyclones form in the  if the  and depending on their strength and location there are various terms by which they are called such as tropical depression tropical storm hurricane and typhoon 

 a type of storm that precipitates round chunks of ice hailstorms usually occur during regular thunder storms while most of the hail that precipitates from the clouds is fairly small and virtually harmless there are occasional occurrences of hail greater than 2inches  5cm  in diameter that can cause much damage and injuries

 a tornado is a violent destructive wind storm occurring on land usually its appearance is that of a dark funnel-shaped cloud often tornadoes are preceded by thunderstorms and a  they are often called the most destructive of storms and while they form all over the world the interior of the united states is the most prone area especially throughout  
classification 
a strict  definition of a terrestrial storm is a wind measuring 10 or higher on the  meaning a wind speed of 24.5   89km h 55mph  or more  however popular usage is not so restrictive storms can last anywhere from 12 to 200 hours depending on season and geography in north america the east and northeast storms are noted for the most frequent repeatability and duration especially during the cold period big terrestrial storms alter the  conditions that in turn may affect food abundance and distribution  strong currents strong tides increased siltation change in water temperatures overturn in the water column etc

storms do not only occur on   other planetary bodies with a sufficient atmosphere   in particular  also undergo stormy weather the  on  provides a well-known example though technically an anticyclone with greater than hurricane wind speeds it is larger than the earth and has persisted for at least 340 years having first been observed by astronomer   also had its own lesser-known  in september 1994 the   using   imaged storms on  generated by upwelling of warmer air similar to a terrestrial thunderhead the east-west extent of the same-year  storm equalled the diameter of earth the storm was observed earlier in september 1990 and acquired the name  the dust storms of  vary in size but can often cover the entire planet they tend to occur when mars comes closest to the sun and have been shown to increase the global temperature one particularly large martian storm was exhaustively studied up close due to coincidental timing when the first  to successfully orbit another planet  arrived and successfully orbited mars on 14 november 1971  were surprised to find the  was thick with a planet-wide robe of  the largest storm ever observed on mars the surface of the planet was totally obscured mariner 9 s computer was reprogrammed from earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled however the surface-obscured images contributed much to the collection of mars atmospheric and planetary surface science two  are known to have storms   and  the former s storm was discovered on june 23 2010 and measured at 6,200km h while the latter produces winds of 17,700 kilometers  11,000mi  per hour across the surface the spin of the planet then creates giant swirling shock-wave storms that carry the heat aloft effects on human society

objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles in the united states  comprise just 21 of all landfalling tropical cyclones but account for 83 of all damage tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges overpasses and roads complicating efforts to transport food clean water and medicine to the areas that need it furthermore the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region and to a  of the population of the region the  or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths the relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles kilometers inland flooding homes and cutting off escape routes the storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales  frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations one of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting under a regime of low precipitation  lp  thunderstorms where little precipitation is present rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat wildfires can devastate vegetation and the biodiversity of an ecosystem wildfires that occur close to urban environments can inflict damages upon infrastructures buildings crops and provide risks to explosions should the flames be exposed to gas pipes direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion in areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning like  lightning causes several fatalities per year most commonly to people working outside precipitation with low   ph  otherwise known as acid rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning  which contains no  has a   of 7 liquids with a ph less than 7 are acidic and those with a ph greater than 7 are bases clean or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic ph of about 5.2 because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form  a weak acid  ph 5.6 in distilled water  but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals  present during thunderstorm phenomena caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules can result in the production of acid rain if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation thus creating acid rain acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon in ecosystems acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in  resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen such as leaks or cracks it is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering  and  rarely massive hailstones have been known to cause  or fatal head  hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history one of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in    the largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the united states fell on july 23 2010 in  in the united states  it measured 8 inches  20cm  in diameter and 18.62 inches  47.3cm  in circumference weighing in at 1.93 pounds  0.88kg  this broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7inches diameter and 18.75inches circumference which fell in  in the united states on june 22 2003 as well as the record for weight set by a hailstone of 1.67 pounds  0.76kg  that fell in  in 1970 various hazards ranging from hail to lightning can affect outside technology facilities such as   and towers as a result companies with outside facilities have begun installing such facilities underground in order to reduce the risk of damage from storms substantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely populations living in snow-prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow such as   and  pulled by horses dogs or other animals and later  basic utilities such as   and  can also fail in addition snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become stuck the combined effects can lead to a   on which gatherings such as school work or church are officially canceled in areas that normally have very little or no snow a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow in some areas such as some states in the united states schools are given a yearly quota of snow days  or  calamity days  once the quota is exceeded the snow days must be made up in other states all snow days must be made up for example schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon shorten  or delay the start of  accumulated snow is  to make travel easier and safer and to decrease the long-term effect of a heavy snowfall this process utilizes  and  and is often assisted by sprinkling  or other chloride-based chemicals which reduce the melting temperature of snow in some areas with abundant snowfall such as   people harvest snow and store it surrounded by  in ice houses this allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling methods agriculture 
hail can cause serious damage notably to  aircraft skylights glass-roofed structures  and most commonly farmers   wheat corn soybeans and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage hail is one of canada s most expensive hazards snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a  conserving the heat of the earth and protecting  from subfreezing weather some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring providing water for crop growth if it melts into water and refreezes upon sensitive crops such as oranges the resulting ice will protect the fruit from exposure to lower temperatures although tropical  take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the  regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions hurricanes in the eastern north pacific often supply moisture to the  and parts of mexico  receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons  averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path though it also killed 259people and caused  9.14billion  2005   in damage aviation 




effect of wind shear on aircraft trajectory merely correcting for the initial gust front can have dire consequences 

hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft when hail stones exceed 0.5 inches  13mm  in diameter planes can be seriously damaged within seconds the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft strong wind outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level initially this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear as the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft the localized headwind diminishes reducing the aircraft s airspeed and increasing its sink rate then when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft the headwind becomes a tailwind reducing lift generated by the wings and leaving the aircraft in a low-power low-speed descent this can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact as the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s in 1988 the u.s  mandated that all commercial aircraft have  by 1993 between 1964 and 1985 wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the u.s that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries since 1995 the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of doppler  units on the ground
