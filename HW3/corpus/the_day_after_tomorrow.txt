production 

the day after tomorrow was inspired by  talk-radio host  and  s book  and strieber wrote the film s   s 1978 novel ice  and douglas orgill and  s the sixth winter  published in 1979  have similar themes before and during the film s release members of environmental and political advocacy groups distributed pamphlets to moviegoers describing the possible effects of global warming although the film depicts effects of global warming predicted by scientists  such as rising sea levels more destructive storms and disruption of ocean currents and weather patterns  it depicts their occurrence more rapidly and severely than what is considered scientifically plausible  the theory that a superstorm could create rapid worldwide  does not appear in the scientific literature 
to choose a studio writer michael wimer created an auction a copy of the script was sent to all major studios along with a term sheet they had 24 hours to decide whether to produce the movie with roland emmerich directing fox studios was the only studio to accept the terms visual effects 
the day after tomorrow is well-known for its special effects and  the movie features 416 visual effects shots with nine effects houses and over 1,000 artists working on the film for over a year to bring its disaster sequences to life reception
the film ranked  2 at the box office  behind   over its four-day  opening grossing  85,807,341 led the per-theater average with a four-day average of  25,053  compared to shrek 2 s four-day average of  22,633  at the end of its theatrical run the film grossed  186,740,799 domestically and  544,272,402 worldwide it was the second-highest opening-weekend film not to lead at the box office   surpassed it in june 2015 critical reaction 
the day after tomorrow received mixed reviews from critics who praised its visual effects and criticized its writing and scientific inaccuracy   rated the film at 45 with an average rating of 5.3 out of 10 according to the website it is  a ludicrous popcorn flick filled with clunky dialogues but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster   of the  described the film as  profoundly silly  but nonetheless said the film was effective and praised the special effects he gave it three stars out of four awards and nominations
emmerich did not deny that his casting of a weak president and the resemblance of vice-president  to  were intended to criticize the  responding to claims of insensitivity in his inclusion of scenes of a devastated  less than three years after the  emmerich said that it was necessary to showcase the increased unity of people in the face of disaster because of the attacks some scientists criticized the film s scientific aspects paleoclimatologist and professor of earth and planetary science at   said  on the one hand i m glad that there s a big-budget movie about something as critical as climate change on the other i m concerned that people will see these over-the-top effects and think the whole thing is a joke  we are indeed experimenting with the earth in a way that hasn t been done for millions of years but you re not going to see another   at least not like that   a research meteorologist at the   expressed a similar sentiment   i m heartened that there s a movie addressing real climate issues but as for the science of the movie i d give it a d minus or an f and i d be concerned if the movie was made to advance a political agenda  according to  climatologist   it s  of climate science movies but i m not losing any sleep over a new ice age because it s impossible 
 a former research professor of  at the  who rejects the scientific consensus on  called the film  propaganda  in a  editorial   as a scientist i bristle when lies dressed up as  science  are used to influence political discourse  college instructor and retired nasa office of inspector general senior special agent joseph gutheinz called the day after tomorrow  a cheap thrill ride which many weak-minded people will jump on and stay on for the rest of their lives  in a space daily editorial when paleoclimatologist william hyde of  was asked on  if he would see the film he answered that he would not unless someone offered him  100 subscribers to the newsgroup took up the challenge and despite hyde s protests raised the  100 hyde s review on google groups criticized the film s depiction of weather which stopped at national borders  it was  to climate science as  is to  surgery  stefan rahmstorf of the  an expert on  and its effect on climate said after a talk with scriptwriter jeffrey nachmanoff at the film s  preview 

 clearly this is a disaster movie and not a scientific documentary  the film makers have taken a lot of artistic license but the film presents an opportunity to explain that some of the basic background is right  humans are indeed increasingly changing the climate and this is quite a dangerous experiment including some risk of abrupt and unforeseen changes  luckily it is extremely unlikely that we will see major ocean circulation changes in the next couple of decades  id be just as surprised as jack hall if they did occur  at least most scientists think this will only become a more serious risk towards the end of the century and the consequences would certainly not be as dramatic as the  superstorm  depicted in the movie nevertheless a major change in ocean circulation is a risk with serious and partly unpredictable consequences which we should avoid and even without events like ocean circulation changes climate change is serious enough to demand decisive action 

environmental activist and  columnist  called the day after tomorrow  a great movie and lousy science  in 2008  movies listed the day after tomorrow as one of its top-10 scientifically inaccurate films it was criticized for depicting  phenomena as occurring over the course of hours instead of decades or centuries a 2015 washington post article reported on a paper published in nature scientific reports which indicated that global temperatures could drop relatively rapidly due to a temporary shutdown of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation caused by global warming home media 
 the film was released on vhs and dvd october 12 2004 and was released in  on  in north america on october 2 2007 and in the united kingdom on april 28 2008 in  with a lossless  track and few bonus features dvd sales were  110 million bringing the film s gross to  652,771,772 see also
