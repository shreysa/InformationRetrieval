social conditions in western virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern portion of the state the population was not homogeneous as a considerable part of the  came by way of pennsylvania and included germans protestant  and settlers from the states farther north counties in the east and south were settled mostly by east virginians during the american revolution the movement to create a state beyond the  was revived and a petition for the establishment of   was presented to  on the grounds that the mountains presented an almost impassable barrier to the east the rugged nature of the country made slavery unprofitable and time only increased the social political economic and cultural differences  see   between the two sections of virginia 
a convention that met in 1829 to form a new constitution for virginia against the protest of the counties beyond the mountains required a property qualification for  this effectively disenfranchised some of the poorer yeoman farmers in addition it gave the slave-holding counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population in apportioning the state s representation in the u.s house of representatives as a result every county beyond the alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution which nevertheless passed because of eastern support the eastern planter elite dominated the legislature and saw to their own interests 
the  the reform convention addressed a number of issues important to western virginians it extended the vote to all white males 21 years or older the governor lieutenant-governor the judiciary sheriffs and other county officers were to be elected by public vote the composition of the general assembly was changed representation in the house of delegates was apportioned on the basis of the census of 1850 counting whites only the senate representation was arbitrarily fixed at 50 seats with the west receiving twenty and the east thirty senators this was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the general assembly to reapportion representation on the basis of white population in 1865 or else put the matter to a public referendum but the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at true and actual value except for slaves slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed and slaves over that age were taxed at only  300 a fraction of their true value small farmers however had all their assets animals and land taxed at full value despite this tax and the lack of  in the west the vote was 75,748 for and 11,063 against the new constitution most of the opposition came from delegates from eastern counties who did not like the compromises made for the west given these differences many in the west had long contemplated a separate state in particular men such as lawyer  from fairmont had long chafed under the political domination of the tidewater and piedmont slave-holders in addition to differences over the abolition of slavery he and allies felt the virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west such as turnpikes and railroads separation from virginia

statehood vote of october 24 1861


west virginia was the only state in the union to separate from a confederate state   during the american civil war in richmond on april 17 1861 the  voted to secede from the union but of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner  which ultimately became west virginia  only voted 17 in favor of the  and 30 voted against with 2 abstentions almost immediately after that vote a mass meeting at  recommended that each county in northwestern virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in  on may 13 1861 when this first  met 425 delegates from 25 counties were present though more than one-third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area but soon there was a division of sentiment some delegates led by  favored the immediate formation of a new state while others led by  argued that as virginia s secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum  as happened on may 23  such action would constitute revolution against the united states the convention decided that if virginians adopted the secession ordinance  of which there was little doubt  another convention including the members-elect of the legislature would meet in wheeling in june 1861 on may 23 1861 secession was ratified by a large majority in virginia as a whole but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the ordinance the second wheeling convention met as agreed on june 11 and declared that since the secession convention had been called without popular consent all its acts were void and that all who adhered to it had vacated their offices the wheeling conventions and the delegates themselves were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western virginia of its 103 members 33 had been elected to the virginia general assembly on may 23 this included some hold-over state senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859 and some who vacated their offices to convene in wheeling other members  were chosen even more irregularlysome in mass meetings others by county committee and still others were seemingly self-appointed  an act for the reorganization of the government was passed on june 19 the next day convention delegates chose  as governor of virginia and elected other officers to a rival state government and two u.s senators  willey and carlile  to replace secessionists before adjourning the federal government in washington d.c promptly recognized the new government and seated the two new senators thus there were two state governments in virginia  one pledging allegiance to the united states and one to the  the second wheeling convention had recessed until august 6 then reassembled on august 20 and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote should be favorable at the october 24 1861 election 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against the election results were questioned since the union army then occupied the area and union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent confederate sympathizers from voting this was also election day for local offices and elections were also held in camps of confederate soldiers who elected rival state officials such as  most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the northern panhandle over 50,000 votes had been cast on the ordinance of secession yet the vote on statehood garnered little more than 19,000 in ohio county home to wheeling only about one-quarter of the registered voters cast votes in most of what would become west virginia there was no vote at all since as two-thirds of the territory of west virginia had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to richmond votes recorded from pro-secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these counties despite that controversy delegates  including many methodist ministers  met to write a new constitution for the new state beginning on november 26 1861 during that constitutional convention a mr lamb of ohio county and a mr carskadon claimed that in hampshire county out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state  the rest were cast illegally by union soldiers one of the key figures was rev  who also represented ohio county and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools as well as to limit movement of slaves into the new state and to gradually abolish slavery the education proposal succeeded but the convention tabled the slavery proposals before finishing its work on february 18 1862 the new constitution was more closely modeled on that of ohio than of virginia adopting a township model of government rather than the  courthouse cliques  of virginia which carlile criticized and a compromise demanded by the kanawha region  charleston lawyers benjamin smith and brown  allowed counties and municipalities to vote subsidies for railroads or other improvement organizations the resulting instrument was ratified  18,162 for and 514 against  on april 11 1862 on may 13 1862 the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state an application for admission to the union was made to congress introduced by senator  of the restored government of virginia however sen carlile sought to sabotage the bill first trying to expand the new state s boundaries to include the shenandoah valley and then to defeat the willey amendment at home on december 31 1862 an enabling act was approved by president  admitting west virginia on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution  as rev battelle had urged in the wheeling intelligencer and also written to lincoln  while many felt that west virginia s admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional lincoln issued his opinion on the admission of west virginia finding that  the body which consents to the admission of west virginia is the legislature of virginia  and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient the convention was reconvened on february 12 1863 and the abolition demand of the federal enabling act was met the revised constitution was adopted on march 26 1863 and on april 20 1863 president lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state 60 days later on june 20 1863 meanwhile officers for the new state were chosen while gov pierpont moved his pro-union virginia capital to union-occupied  where he asserted and exercised jurisdiction over all of the remaining virginia counties within the federal lines the question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was later brought before the  in the following manner   and  counties lying on the potomac east of the mountains in 1863 with the consent of the reorganized government of virginia voted in favor of annexation to west virginia many voters of the strongly pro-secessionist counties were absent in the confederate army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer when they returned the  repealed the act of secession and in 1866 brought suit against west virginia asking the court to declare the counties a part of virginia which would have declared west virginia s admission as a state unconstitutional meanwhile on march 10 1866 congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer the supreme court decided in favor of west virginia in 1870 during the civil war union general  s forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861 culminating at the  and union control was never again seriously threatened despite an attempt by  in the same year in 1863 general  with 5,000 confederates raided a considerable portion of the state and burned pierpont s library although senator willey escaped their grasp bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended the eastern panhandle counties were more affected by the war with military control of the area repeatedly changing hands the area that became west virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and confederate armies approximately 22,00025,000 each in 1865 the wheeling government found it necessary to strip voting rights from returning confederates in order to retain control james ferguson who proposed the law said that if it was not enacted he would lose election by 500 votes the property of confederates might also be confiscated and in 1866 a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid and comfort to the confederacy was adopted the addition of the  and  to the united states constitution caused a reaction the  secured control in 1870 and in 1871 the constitutional amendment of 1866 was abrogated the first steps toward this change had been taken however by the  in 1870 on august 22 1872 an entirely new constitution was adopted beginning in  and for several decades thereafter the two states disputed the new state s share of the pre-war virginia government s debts which had mostly been incurred to finance public infrastructure improvements such as canals roads and railroads under the  virginiansled by former confederate general formed a political coalition based upon this  the  although west virginia s first constitution provided for the assumption of a part of the virginia debt negotiations opened by virginia in 1870 were fruitless and in 1871 virginia funded two-thirds of the debt and arbitrarily assigned the remainder to west virginia the issue was finally settled in 1915 when the  ruled that west virginia owed virginia  12,393,929.50 the final installment of this sum was paid in 1939 development of natural resources
