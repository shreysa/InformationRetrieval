teletype games 
main article  
the earliest form of computer game to achieve any degree of mainstream use was the text-based  game teletype games lack video display screens and instead present the game to the player by printing a series of characters on paper which the player reads as it emerges from the  practically this means that each action taken will require a line of paper and thus a hard-copy record of the game remains after it has been played this naturally tends to reduce the size of the gaming universe or alternatively to require a great amount of paper as  became standard during the rise of the  text-baseddriven language parsing teletype games transitioned into visual  allowing for greater depth of gameplay and reduced paper requirements this transition was accompanied by a simultaneous shift from the  environment to the  examples of text-based teletype games include

within these categories the systems are differentiated between by their manufacturer and generation  corresponding to the year of their release  console games are also often differentiated by  hybrid or combined games 
game hybridization refers to the integration of an interactive electronic component into a game a  hybrid  or  combined game  is any tabletop game where an electronic device and or application is an element crucial to the gameplay these games are a catalyst for creating new game mechanics important consequences of this technology are  the possible substitution of the gamemaster or person who leads a game for an application or device which can be more fair with less room for bias cheating or favouritism and can be intelligently randomised  the possibility of using  and machine learning in games  greater randomisation of events  possibility of conducting fast and advanced mathematical calculations making some complex games easier or available to a wider group of consumers  and enhanced player immersion with the aid of various stimuli like sound or animation one may categorize hybrid games as follows 

purpose-built devices  where the game uses a device that has certain functions  like an electronic dice or spinner  to play out the game an example would be  monopoly  electronic banking   2007  by hasbro  where all players have an electronic card which carries virtual monopoly currency and use a machine to increase and deduct their earnings beacon technology games are mobile digital games that employ  to track and control players movements and actions an example  artifact technologies created a mobile digital board game called battlekasters  where players physically walk around to cast spells or unlock cards augmented reality  board games that interact with a mobile device and immerse the player in the virtual environment through animation sound and or vibrations example  roar  by trefl which utilises sound as part of the gameplay
