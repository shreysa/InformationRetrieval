the weather satellite is a type of  that is primarily used to monitor the  and  of the  satellites can be  covering the entire earth asynchronously or  hovering over the same spot on the  meteorological  see more than clouds and  city lights fires effects of pollution  sand and  snow cover ice mapping boundaries of  energy flows etc other types of environmental information are collected using weather satellites weather satellite images helped in monitoring the volcanic ash cloud from  and activity from other volcanoes such as  smoke from  in the western united states such as  and  have also been monitored other  can detect changes in the earth s vegetation  ocean color and ice fields for example the 2002  off the northwest coast of spain was watched carefully by the european  which though not a weather satellite flies an instrument  asar  which can see changes in the sea surface  and its effects on weather are monitored daily from satellite images the antarctic  is mapped from weather satellite data collectively weather satellites flown by the u.s europe india china russia and japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch

as early as 1946 the idea of cameras in orbit to observe the weather was being developed this was due to sparse data observation coverage and the expense of using cloud cameras on rockets by 1958 the early prototypes for tiros and vanguard  developed by the army signal corps  were created the first weather satellite  was launched on february17 1959 it was designed to measure cloud cover and resistance but a poor axis of rotation and its elliptical orbit kept it from collecting a notable amount of useful data the explorer vi and vii satellites also contained weather-related experiments the first weather satellite to be considered a success was  launched by nasa on april1 1960 tiros operated for 78days and proved to be much more successful than vanguard2 tiros paved the way for the  whose technology and findings are the heritage of most of the earth-observing satellites nasa and noaa have launched since then beginning with the nimbus3 satellite in 1969 temperature information through the  column began to be retrieved by satellites from the eastern atlantic and most of the pacific ocean which led to significant improvements to  the essa and noaa polar orbiting satellites followed suit from the late 1960s onward geostationary satellites followed beginning with the ats and sms series in the late1960s and early1970s then continuing with the goes series from the 1970s onward polar orbiting satellites such as  and  began to relay wind information near the ocean s surface starting in the late1970s with microwave imagery which resembled radar displays which significantly improved the diagnoses of  strength intensification and location during the 2000s and 2010s observation 
observation is typically made via different  channels  of the  in particular the  and  portions some of these channels include 

visible and near infrared  0.61.6m for recording cloud cover during the day
infrared  3.97.3m  water vapor  8.713.4m  thermal imaging 

visible spectrum 
visible-light images from weather satellites during local daylight hours are easy to interpret even by the average person  clouds cloud systems such as fronts and tropical storms lakes forests mountains snow ice fires and pollution such as smoke smog dust and haze are readily apparent even wind can be determined by cloud patterns alignments and movement from successive photos infrared spectrum 
the  or infrared images recorded by sensors called scanning  enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types to calculate land and surface water temperatures and to locate ocean surface features  satellite imagery can be used effectively for  with a visible  pattern using the  where the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops can be used to determine its intensity  colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm  infrared pictures depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the gulf stream which are valuable to the shipping industry  and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea even el nio phenomena can be spotted using color-digitized techniques the gray shaded  can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information types

each meteorological satellite is designed to use one of two different classes of orbit   and  geostationary 
 geostationary meteorological satellite  redirects here for the japanese satellites called  geostationary meteorological satellite  see  geostationary weather satellites orbit the earth above the  at altitudes of 35,880km  22,300 miles  because of this  they remain stationary with respect to the rotating earth and thus can record or transmit images of the entire hemisphere below continuously with their visible-light and infrared sensors the news media use the geostationary photos in their daily weather presentation as single images or made into movie loops these are also available on the city forecast pages of www.noaa.gov  example dallas tx  several geostationary meteorological spacecraft are in operation the united states has three in operation 12 goes-13 and goes-15 goes-12 previously designated goes-east and now used for south america is located at 60 degrees west goes-13 took over the role of goes-east on april 14 2010 and is located at 75 degrees west goes-11 was goes-west over the eastern pacific ocean until it was decommissioned december 2011 and replaced by goes-15  s new-generation weather satellite   operates at 76e over the indian ocean the japanese have the2 located over the mid pacific at 145e and the  at 140e the europeans have four in operation8  3.5w  and meteosat-9  0  over the atlantic ocean and have meteosat-6  63e  and meteosat-7  57.5e  over the indian ocean china currently has three    geostationary satellites  fy-2e at 86.5e fy-2f at 123.5e and fy-2g at 105e  operated  also operates geostationary satellites called  which carry instruments for meteorological purposes polar orbiting

polar orbiting weather satellites circle the earth at a typical altitude of 850km  530 miles  in a north to south  or vice versa  path passing over the poles in their continuous flight polar orbiting weather satellites are in  which means they are able to observe any place on earth and will view every location twice each day with the same general lighting conditions due to the near-constant local  polar orbiting weather satellites offer a much better resolution than their geostationary counterparts due their closeness to the earth the united states has the  series of polar orbiting meteorological satellites presently noaa 17 and noaa 18 as primary spacecraft noaa 15 and noaa 16 as secondary spacecraft noaa 14 in standby and noaa 12 europe has thea andb satellites operated by  russia has the  and resurs series of satellites china has3a 3b and 3c india has polar orbiting satellites as well dmsp
