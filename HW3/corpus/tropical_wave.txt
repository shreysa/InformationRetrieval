tropical waves easterly waves or tropical easterly waves also known as african easterly waves in the  region are a type of   an elongated area of relatively  oriented  to  which moves from  to  across the  causing areas of  and  west-moving waves can also form from the tail end of  zones in the  and tropics and may be referred to as easterly waves but these waves are not properly called tropical waves  they are a form of  sharing many characteristics with fully tropical waves all tropical waves form in the easterly flow along the equatorward side of the  or belt of  which lies north and south of the   itcz  tropical waves are generally carried westward by the  along the tropics and subtropics near the  they can lead to the formation of  in the north atlantic and eastern north pacific  tropical wave study is aided by  a graph of meteorological data

characteristics 
a tropical wave normally follows an area of sinking intensely dry air blowing from the northeast after the passage of the trough line the wind veers southeast the humidity abruptly rises and the atmosphere  this yields widespread showers and thunderstorms sometimes severe as the wave moves westward the showers gradually diminish an exception to this rain is in the atlantic sometimes a surge of dry air called the   sal  follows a tropical wave leaving cloudless skies as  is capped by the dry layer inversion also any dust in the sal reflects sunlight cooling the air below it atlantic 





tropical wave formation 


tropical waves in the atlantic basin develop from disturbances which develop as far east as  in east   and drift over the continent into the  these are generated or enhanced by the  the clockwise circulation of the large transoceanic  or  centered near the  islands  known as the   impels easterly waves away from the coastal areas of africa towards  approximately 60 of atlantic  originate from tropical waves while approximately 85 of intense atlantic hurricanes   and greater  develop from tropical waves tropical cyclones can sometimes degenerate back into a tropical wave this normally occurs if upper-level  is too strong the storm can redevelop if the upper level shear abates if a tropical wave is moving quickly it can have strong winds over tropical storm force strength but it is not considered a tropical storm unless it has a closed low-level circulation an example of this was  in  where the original wave had winds of 45mph  72km h  before developing a circulation east pacific 
it has been suggested that some eastern  tropical cyclones are formed out of tropical easterly waves that originate in  as well during the summer months tropical waves can extend northward as far as the desert southwest of the united states producing spells of intensified shower activity embedded within the prevailing  regime screaming eagle waves 
a screaming eagle is a tropical wave whose convective pattern loosely resembles the head of an eagle this phenomenon is caused by  from either westerly winds aloft or strong easterly winds at the surface these systems are typically located within 25degrees latitude of the equator  showers and surface  gusting to 29mph  47km h  are associated with these waves they move across the ocean at a rate of 15mph  24km h  strong thunderstorm activity can be associated with the features when located east of a  the term was first publicly seen in an   interpretation handbook written by hank brandli in 1976 in 1969 brandli discovered that a storm of this type threatened the original splashdown site for  see also
