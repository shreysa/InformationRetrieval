each half of a flag depicts 5 knots  9.3km h  of wind each full flag depicts 10 knots  19km h  of wind each   filled triangle  depicts 50 knots  93km h  of wind 
winds are depicted as blowing from the direction the barb is facing therefore a northeast wind will be depicted with a line extending from the cloud circle to the northeast with flags indicating wind speed on the northeast end of this line once plotted on a map an analysis of   lines of equal wind speeds  can be accomplished isotachs are particularly useful in diagnosing the location of the jet stream on upper level constant pressure charts and are usually located at or above the 300hpa level wind power

wind energy is the  of the air in motion the kinetic energy of a packet of air of mass m with velocity v is given by  m v2 to find the mass of the packet passing through an area a perpendicular its velocity  which could be the rotor area of a turbine  we multiply its volume after time t has passed with the   which gives us m   a v t  so we find that the total wind energy is 



 with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy we find that the total wind  is 



wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity theoretical power captured by a wind turbine 
total wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero in a realistic wind turbine this is impossible as the captured air must also leave the turbine a relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered using the concept of  the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59 of the total theoretical wind power  see    practical wind turbine power

sea and land breezes 
main article  




a  sea breeze  occurs at daytime  b  land breeze  occurs at night 


in coastal regions sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a location s prevailing winds the sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water s greater  compared to land as the temperature of the surface of the land rises the land heats the air above it by conduction the warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises this causes a pressure gradient of about 2millibars from the ocean to the land the cooler air above the sea now with higher  flows inland into the lower pressure creating a cooler breeze near the coast when large-scale winds are calm the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea if an offshore wind of 8 knots  15km h  exists the sea breeze is not likely to develop at night the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their  values this temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate when the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land establishing a land breeze as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it near mountains

wind dispersal of seeds or  is one of the more primitive means of dispersal wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms  seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively they can flutter to the ground the classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include    spp   which have a feathery  attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances and    spp   which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground an important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for  there are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism for instance species in the asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities  i.e larger seed mass and smaller pappus  relative to the same species on the mainland reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many  or  species unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include  a related process to anemochory is  which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind large families of plants are pollinated in this manner which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together wind also limits tree growth on coasts and isolated mountains the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger more complex mountain systems because strong winds reduce tree growth high winds scour away thin  through erosion as well as damage limbs and twigs when high winds knock down or uproot trees the process is known as  this is most likely on  slopes of mountains with severe cases generally occurring to  that are 75years or older plant varieties near the coast such as the  and  are  back by wind and salt spray near the coastline wind can also cause plants damage through  strong winds will pick up loose sand and  and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from 25 miles per hour  40km h  to 40 miles per hour  64km h  such windblown sand causes extensive damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought using a mechanical sandblaster in a laboratory setting scientists affiliated with the  studied the effects of windblown sand abrasion on cotton seedlings the study showed that the seedlings responded to the damage created by the windblown sand abrasion by shifting energy from stem and root growth to the growth and repair of the damaged stems after a period of four weeks the growth of the seedling once again became uniform throughout the plant as it was before the windblown sand abrasion occurred effect on animals

strong 300 kilometers per hour  190mph  winds at venus s cloud tops circle the planet every four to five earth days when the poles of  are exposed to sunlight after their winter the frozen co2  creating significant winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400 kilometers per hour  250mph  which subsequently transports large amounts of dust and water vapor over its  other martian winds have resulted in  and  on  wind speeds of 100 meters per second  220mph  are common in zonal jet streams saturn s winds are among the solar system s fastest  data indicated peak easterly winds of 375 meters per second  840mph  on  northern hemisphere wind speeds reach as high as 240 meters per second  540mph  near 50degrees north latitude at the cloud tops of  prevailing winds range in speed from 400 meters per second  890mph  along the equator to 250 meters per second  560mph  at the poles at 70 s latitude on neptune a high-speed jet stream travels at a speed of 300 meters per second  670mph  the fastest wind on any known planet is on  located 190  away where it blows at more than 11,000mph or 5km s see also
