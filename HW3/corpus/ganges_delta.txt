the ganges-brahmaputra delta  also known as the brahmaputra delta the sunderbans delta or the bengal delta  is a  in the  region of the  consisting of  and the indian state of  it is the world s largest delta and empties into the  it is also one of the most fertile regions in the world thus earning the nickname the green delta the delta stretches from the  on the west to the  on the east it is approximately 354km  220mi  across at the bay of bengal  in india and  in bangladesh are the principal seaports of the delta a number of large rivers flow through the brahmaputra delta including the   main  of the   and the   main distributary of the   which merge and then join the meghna before entering the sea

delta of ganges from the map of surveyor   1778 


the ganges delta has the shape of a triangle and is considered to be an  arcuate  delta  arc-shaped  it covers more than 105,000km2  41,000sqmi  and although the delta lies mostly in bangladesh and india rivers from  tibet india and  drain into it from the north approximately 60 of the delta is in  and 40 in   most of the delta is composed of  soils made up by small sediment particles that finally settle down as river currents slow down in the estuary rivers carry these fine particles with them even from their sources at glaciers as  red and red-yellow  soils are found as one heads farther east the soil has large amounts of minerals and nutrients which is good for agriculture it is composed of a labyrinth of   lakes and flood plain sediments  chars  the  one of the distributaries of the ganges divides the ganges delta into two parts  the geologically young active eastern delta and the older less active western delta population 
between 125 and 143 million people live on the delta  despite risks from floods caused by  heavy runoff from the melting snows of the  and  a large part of the nation of bangladesh lies in the ganges delta and many of the country s people depend on the delta for survival it is believed that upwards of 300 million people are supported by the ganges delta and approximately 400million people live in the ganges river basin making it the most populous river basin in the world most of the ganges delta has a population density of more than 200 people per km2  520 people per square mile  making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world wildlife 








three  cover the delta the  ecoregion covers most of the delta region although the forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture and only small enclaves remain thick stands of tall grass known as canebrakes grow in wetter areas the  ecoregion lies closer to the bay of bengal  this ecoregion is flooded with slightly  water during the dry season and fresh water during the monsoon season these forests too have been almost completely converted to intensive agriculture with only 130 square kilometres  50sqmi  of the ecoregion s 14,600 square kilometres  5,600sqmi  protected where the delta meets the bay of bengal  form the world s largest  ecoregion covering an area of 20,400 square kilometres  7,900sqmi  in a chain of 54 islands they derive their name from the predominant mangrove species  fomes which are known locally as sundri or sundari animals in the delta include the indian python   clouded leopard     elephas maximus indicus  and  which live in the sundarbans approximately 1,020 endangered   panthera tigris tigris  are believed to inhabit the sundarbans the gangesbrahmaputra basin has tropical deciduous forests that yield valuable timber    and  trees are found in these areas the delta region has mangrove trees it is estimated that 30,000   axis axis  are in the sundarbans part of the delta birds found in the delta include    the shalik   the   francolinus gularis  and the doel   two species of dolphin can be found in the delta  the   orcaella brevirostris  and the   platanista gangetica gangetica  the irrawaddy dolphin is an  which enters the delta from the bay of bengal the ganges river dolphin is a true  but is extremely rare and considered  trees found in the delta include  garjan   spp   mangrove palm   and mangrove date palm   many endangered species live here geology 
the ganges delta lies at the junction of three tectonic plates  the  the  and the  the edge of the  paleoshelf runs approximately from  to the edge of the  the edge of the paleoshelf marks the transition from the thick continental crust in the northwest to the thin continental or oceanic crust in the southeast the enormous sediment supply from the himalayan collision has extended the delta about 400 kilometres  250mi  seaward since the  the sediment thickness southeast of the edge of the paleoshelf beneath the ganges delta can exceed 16km  10 miles  economy 




rice cattle and fishing in rivers and ponds are important sources of food 

approximately two-thirds of the bangladesh people work in agriculture and grow crops on the fertile floodplains of the delta the major crops that are grown in the ganges delta are  tea and rice fishing is also an important activity in the delta region with fish being a major source of food for many of the people in the area in recent years scientists have been helping the poor people of the delta to improve fish farming methods by turning unused ponds into viable fish farms and improving methods of raising fish in existing ponds many people can now earn a living raising and selling fish using new systems fish production in existing ponds has increased 800 shrimp are farmed in containers or cages that are submerged in open water most are exported

the  which spans the  river in 


as there is a maze of many river branches the area is difficult to pass most islands are only connected with the mainland by simple wooden ferryboats bridges are rare some islands are not yet connected to the electric grid so island residents tend to use solar cells for a bit of electric supply climate 
the ganges delta lies mostly in the tropical wet  zone and receives between 1,500 to 2,000mm  59 to 79in  of rainfall each year in the western part and 2,000 to 3,000mm  79 to 118in  in the eastern part  hot dry summers and cool dry winters make the climate suitable for agriculture cyclones and flooding 
in november 1970 the deadliest tropical cyclone of the twentieth century hit the ganges delta region the  killed 500,000 people  official death toll  with another 100,000 missing  estimated the total loss of human life from the bhola cyclone at 1,000,000  hit the delta in 1991 killing about 139,000 people people have to be careful on the river delta as severe flooding also occurs in 1998 the ganges flooded the delta killing about 1,000 people and leaving more than 30 million people homeless the bangladesh government asked for  900million to help feed the people of the region as the entire rice crop was lost future of the delta 
one of the greatest challenges people living on the ganges delta may face in coming years is the threat of  an increase in sea level of 0.5 metres  1ft 8in  could result in six million people losing their homes in bangladesh important gas reserves have been discovered in the delta such as in the titas and bakhrabad gas fields several major oil companies have invested in exploration of the ganges delta region view
