the ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier early approaches to predicting weather were based on  and were practiced by priests  inscriptions on  tablets included associations between thunder and rain the  differentiated the  and  ancient   contain mentions of clouds and seasons the samaveda mentions sacrifices to be performed when certain phenomena were noticed  s classical work brihatsamhita written about 500 ad provides evidence of weather observation in 350 bc  wrote  aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology one of the most impressive achievements described in the meteorology is the description of what is now known as the  the book   composed before 250 bc or between 350 and 200 bc  noted

if the flashing body is set on fire and rushes violently to the earth it is called a thunderbolt  if it is only half of fire but violent also and massive it is called a meteor  if it is entirely free from fire it is called a smoking bolt they are all called  swooping bolts  because they swoop down upon the earth lightning is sometimes smoky and is then called  smoldering lightning  sometimes it darts quickly along and is then said to be vivid at other times it travels in crooked lines and is called forked lightning when it swoops down upon some object it is called  swooping lightning  
the  scientist  compiled a book on weather forecasting called the book of signs the work of theophrastus remained a dominant influence in the study of weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2,000 years in 25 ad  a geographer for the  formalized the climatic zone system according to toufic fahd around the 9th century  wrote the kitab al-nabat  book of plants  in which he deals with the application of meteorology to  during the  he describes the meteorological character of the sky the  and  the sun and  the  indicating  and rain the anwa   of rain  and atmospheric phenomena such as winds thunder lightning snow floods valleys rivers lakes 
early attempts at predicting weather were often related to prophesy and divining and sometimes based on astrological ideas admiral fitzroy tried to separate scientific approaches from prophetic ones research of visual atmospheric phenomena

each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment in the atmosphere there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured rain which can be observed or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically also two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity neither of these can be seen but can be felt the devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the  the anemometer and the hygrometer many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable even  noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists they give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a  a ship or a  the measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables usually temperature  wind measurements and  are the variables that are measured by a thermometer barometer anemometer and hygrometer respectively professional stations may also include air quality sensors       and     cloud ceiling  falling precipitation sensor            ir vis uv              and tremors    visibility  and a  for  upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting the most widely used technique is launches of  supplementing the radiosondes a  is organized by the   as used in meteorology is the concept of collecting data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information the common types of remote sensing are   and   or   each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and usually stores the data where the instrument is located radar and lidar are not passive because both use  to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere weather satellites along with more general-purpose earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to  spatial scales 
the study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales at one extreme of this scale is climatology in the timescales of hours to days meteorology separates into micro meso and synoptic scale meteorology respectively the  size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale other subclassifications are used to describe the unique local or broad effects within those subclasses 
microscale 
main article  
microscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena on a scale of about 1 kilometre  0.62mi  or less individual thunderstorms clouds and local turbulence caused by buildings and other obstacles  such as individual hills  are modeled on this scale mesoscale 
main article  
mesoscale meteorology is the study of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1km to 1000km and a vertical scale that starts at the earth s surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer troposphere  and the lower section of the  mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to weeks the events typically of interest are     in  and  and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and  synoptic scale 




  synoptic scale weather analysis 

main article  
synoptic scale meteorology predicts atmospheric changes at scales up to 1000km and 105 sec  28 days  in time and space at the synoptic scale the  acting on moving air masses  outside of the tropics  plays a dominant role in predictions the phenomena typically described by  include events such as extratropical cyclones baroclinic troughs and ridges  and to some extent  all of these are typically given on  for a specific time the minimum horizontal scale of synoptic phenomena is limited to the spacing between  global scale 




annual mean sea surface temperatures 

global scale meteorology is the study of weather patterns related to the transport of heat from the  to the  very large scale oscillations are of importance at this scale these oscillations have time periods typically on the order of months such as the  or years such as the  and the  global scale meteorology pushes into the range of climatology the traditional definition of climate is pushed into larger timescales and with the understanding of the longer time scale global oscillations their effect on climate and weather disturbances can be included in the synoptic and mesoscale timescales predictions numerical weather prediction is a main focus in understanding airsea interaction tropical meteorology atmospheric predictability and tropospheric stratospheric processes the  in monterey california developed a global atmospheric model called   nogaps  nogaps is run operationally at  for the united states military many other global atmospheric models are run by national meteorological agencies some meteorological principles
 meteorology is the study of processes in the air layer directly above earth s surface known as the   abl  the effects of the surface heating cooling and  cause  within the air layer significant movement of   or  on time scales of less than a day are caused by turbulent motions boundary layer meteorology includes the study of all types of surfaceatmosphere boundary including ocean lake urban land and non-urban land for the study of meteorology dynamic meteorology 
dynamic meteorology generally focuses on the  of the atmosphere the idea of  is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere an air parcel is defined as a point in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere the fundamental laws of fluid dynamics thermodynamics and motion are used to study the atmosphere the physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature density pressure etc these variables have unique values in the continuum applications

main article  
weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the  at a future time and given location humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th century weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative  about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in  current weather conditions and sky condition  are now used to determine future conditions human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon which involves pattern recognition skills  knowledge of model performance and knowledge of model biases the  nature of the atmosphere the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere error involved in measuring the initial conditions and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made  the range of the forecast  increases the use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome there are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property forecasts based on temperature and  are important to agriculture and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days on an everyday basis people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and  forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead and survive them aviation meteorology 
aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on  it is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft as noted by the  

the effects of ice on aircraft are cumulativethrust is reduced drag increases lift lessens and weight increases the results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance in extreme cases 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes it takes but 1 2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage 
agricultural meteorology 
meteorologists  agricultural hydrologists and  are persons concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution  water-use efficiency  of plant and animal development and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems conversely they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather hydrometeorology 
 is the branch of meteorology that deals with the  the water budget and the rainfall statistics of  a hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating  quantitative  precipitation heavy rain heavy snow and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology mesoscale and synoptic meteorology and other geosciences the multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently be optimized for different hard and software platforms and use different data formats there are some initiatives  such as the drihm project  that are trying to address this issue nuclear meteorology 
nuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of   and  in the atmosphere maritime meteorology 
maritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea organizations such as the  honolulu  forecast office united kingdom  and  prepare high seas forecasts for the world s oceans military meteorology 
main article  
military meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for  purposes in the united states the  s  oversees meteorological efforts for the navy and  while the  s  is responsible for the air force and  environmental meteorology
