this article breaks down some of the impacts of climate change according to different levels of future global warming this way of describing impacts has for instance been used in the ipcc   assessment reports on climate change the instrumental  shows global warming of around 0.6c during the 20th century sres emissions scenarios
the future level of global warming is uncertain but a wide range of estimates  projections  have been made the ipcc s   scenarios have been frequently used to make  2224 the sres scenarios are    or  reference  scenarios which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit ghg emissions  e.g the unfccc s  and the   emissions projections of the sres scenarios are broadly comparable in range to the baseline emissions scenarios that have been developed by the scientific community in the  changes in future global mean temperature were projected using the six sres  marker  emissions scenarios emissions projections for the six sres  marker  scenarios are representative of the full set of forty sres scenarios for the lowest emissions sres marker scenario  b1   see the  article for details on this scenario  the best estimate for global mean temperature is an increase of 1.8c  3.2f  by the end of the 21st century this projection is relative to global temperatures at the end of the 20th century the  likely  range  greater than 66 probability based on expert judgement  for the sres b1 marker scenario is 1.12.9c  2.05.2f  for the highest emissions sres marker scenario  a1fi  the best estimate for global mean temperature increase is 4.0c  7.2f  with a  likely  range of 2.46.4c  4.311.5f  the range in temperature projections partly reflects  1  the choice of  and  2  the   2224 for  1  different scenarios make different assumptions of future social and economic development  e.g     which in turn affects projections of greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions 2224 the projected magnitude of warming by 2100 is closely related to the level of cumulative emissions over the 21st century  i.e total emissions between 20002100  the higher the cumulative emissions over this time period the greater the level of warming is projected to occur  2  reflects uncertainty in the response of the climate system to past and future ghg emissions which is measured by the  2224 higher estimates of climate sensitivity lead to greater projected warming while lower estimates of climate sensitivity lead to less projected warming over the next several millennia projections suggest that global warming could be irreversible even if emissions were drastically reduced global temperatures would remain close to their highest level for at least 1,000 years  see the later section on   projected warming in context

scientists have used various  proxy  data to assess past changes in earth s climate   sources of proxy data include historical records  such as   logs      and ocean and lake  analysis of these data suggest that recent warming is unusual in the past 400 years possibly longer by the end of the 21st century temperatures may increase to a level not experienced since the mid around 3 million years ago at that time models suggest that mean global temperatures were about 23c warmer than pre-industrial temperatures even a 2c rise above the pre-industrial level would be outside the range of temperatures experienced by human  physical impacts

some changes  e.g more frequent hot days  will probably be evident in the near term while other near-term changes  e.g more intense droughts and tropical cyclones  are more uncertain 
long-term projections  20812100 

future climate change will be associated with more very hot days and fewer very cold days the frequency length and intensity of  will very likely increase over most land areas higher growth in anthropogenic ghg emissions will be associated with larger increases in the frequency and severity of temperature extremes assuming high growth in ghg emissions  ipcc scenario   presently dry regions may be affected by an increase in the risk of drought and reductions in  over most of the mid-latitude land masses and wet tropical regions extreme precipitation events will very likely become more intense and frequent 
tropical cyclones

at the global scale the frequency of tropical cyclones will probably decrease or be unchanged global mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and precipitation rates will likely increase changes in tropical cyclones will probably vary by region but these variations are uncertain 
effects of climate extremes

the impacts of extreme events on the environment and human society will vary some impacts will be beneficiale.g fewer cold extremes will probably lead to fewer cold deaths overall however impacts will probably be mostly negative cryosphere

this map shows changes in the amount of  dissolved in  surface waters between the 1880s and the most recent decade  20032012  historical modeling suggests that since the 1880s increased co2 has led to lower  saturation levels  less availability of minerals  in the oceans around the world the largest decreases in aragonite saturation have occurred in  waters however decreases in cold areas may be of greater concern because colder waters typically have lower aragonite levels to begin with 

about one-third of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity has already been taken up by the oceans as carbon dioxide dissolves in   is formed which has the effect of acidifying the ocean measured as a change in  the uptake of human carbon emissions since the year 1750 has led to an average decrease in ph of 0.1 units projections using the sres emissions scenarios suggest a further reduction in average global surface ocean ph of between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st century the effects of ocean acidification on the marine  have yet to be documented laboratory experiments suggest beneficial effects for a few species with potentially highly detrimental effects for a substantial number of species with medium confidence fischlin et al  2007  projected that future ocean acidification and climate change would impair a wide range of  and shallow  marine organisms that use  to make their shells or skeletons such as  and marine    with significant impacts particularly in the southern ocean oxygen depletion

trends in global average absolute sea level 18702008 

there is strong evidence that global sea level rose gradually over the 20th century with high confidence bindoff et al  2007  concluded that between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries the rate of sea level rise increased authors of the ipcc fourth assessment synthesis report  ipcc ar4 syr 2007  reported that between the years 1961 and 2003 global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8mm per year  mm yr  with a range of 1.32.3mm yr between 1993 and 2003 the rate increased above the previous period to 3.1mm yr  range of 2.43.8mm yr  authors of ipcc ar4 syr  2007  were uncertain whether the increase in rate from 1993 to 2003 was due to  in sea level over the time period or whether it reflected an increase in the underlying long-term trend there are two main factors that have contributed to observed sea level rise the first is   as ocean water warms it expands the second is from the contribution of land-based ice due to increased melting the major store of water on land is found in glaciers and ice sheets anthropogenic forces very likely  greater than 90 probability based on expert judgement  contributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century there is a widespread consensus that substantial long-term sea level rise will continue for centuries to come in their fourth assessment report the ipcc projected sea level rise to the end of the 21st century using the sres emissions scenarios across the six sres marker scenarios sea level was projected to rise by 18 to 59cm  7.1 to 23.2in  relative to sea level at the end of the 20th century thermal expansion is the largest component in these projections contributing 7075 of the central estimate for all scenarios due to a lack of scientific understanding this sea level rise estimate does not include all of the possible contributions of ice sheets  see the section on   an assessment of the  on climate change was published in 2010 by the   us nrc 2010  nrc  2010  described the projections in ar4  i.e those cited in the above paragraph  as  conservative  and summarized the results of more recent studies cited studies suggested a great deal of uncertainty in projections a range of projections suggested possible sea level rise by the end of the 21st century of between 0.56 and 2 m relative to sea levels at the end of the 20th century ocean temperature rise




global ocean heat content from 19552012


from 1961 to 2003 the global ocean temperature has risen by 0.10c from the surface to a depth of 700 m there is variability both year-to-year and over longer time scales with global ocean heat content observations showing high rates of warming for 19912003 but some cooling from 2003 to 2007 the temperature of the antarctic  rose by 0.17c  0.31f  between the 1950s and the 1980s nearly twice the rate for the world s oceans as a whole as well as having effects on ecosystems  e.g by melting sea ice affecting algae that grow on its underside  warming reduces the ocean s ability to absorb co

regional effects of global warming vary in nature some are the result of a generalised global change such as rising temperature resulting in local effects such as melting ice in other cases a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system in such cases the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend there are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate  melting or forming ice changing the   of  and   and changing  and air flows in the atmosphere the coast can also be considered a region and will suffer severe impacts from  observed impacts
with very high confidence rosenzweig et al  2007  concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes particularly regional temperature increases impacts include earlier leafing of  and  over many regions  movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes in the northern hemisphere  changes in  in europe north america and australia  and shifting of the oceans   and  from cold to warm-adapted communities the human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming with greater temperature increases over land and in  rather than over the oceans 6 using models it is possible to identify the human  signal  of global warming over both land and ocean areas 6
projected impacts
projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale 9 it is however expected that future warming will follow a similar geographical pattern to that seen already with greatest warming over land and high northern  and least over the  and parts of the  nearly all land areas will very likely warm more than the global average the   small islands and   are regions that are likely to be especially affected by climate change   areas are at most risk of experiencing negative impacts due to climate change  are also vulnerable to climate change for example developed countries will be negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some  events such as  in all regions some people can be particularly at risk from climate change such as the  young  and the  social systems

projected changes in crop yields at different latitudes with global warming this graph is based on several studies 





projected changes in yields of selected crops with global warming this graph is based on several studies 

with low to medium confidence schneider et al  2007  projected that for about a 1 to 3c increase in global mean temperature  by the years 20902100 relative to average temperatures in the years 19902000  there would be productivity decreases for some  in low latitudes and productivity increases in high latitudes with medium confidence global production potential was projected to 

increase up to around 3c very likely decrease above about 3c 
most of the studies on global agriculture assessed by schneider et al  2007  had not incorporated a number of critical factors including changes in extreme events or the spread of pests and diseases studies had also not considered the development of specific practices or technologies to aid  the graphs opposite show the projected effects of climate change on selected crop yields actual changes in yields may be above or below these central estimates the projections above can be expressed relative to pre-industrial  1750  temperatures 0.6c of warming is estimated to have occurred between 1750 and 19902000 add 0.6c to the above projections to convert them from a 19902000 to pre-industrial baseline food security
easterling et al  2007  assessed studies that made quantitative projections of climate change impacts on  it was noted that these projections were highly uncertain and had limitations however the assessed studies suggested a number of fairly robust findings the first was that climate change would likely increase the number of people at risk of  compared with reference scenarios with no climate change climate change impacts depended strongly on projected future social and economic development additionally the magnitude of climate change impacts was projected to be smaller compared to the impact of social and economic development in 2006 the global estimate for the number of people  was 820 million under the sres a1 b1 and b2 scenarios  see the  for information on each scenario group  projections for the year 2080 showed a reduction in the number of people undernourished of about 560700million people with a global total of undernourished people of 100240million in 2080 by contrast the sres a2 scenario showed only a small decrease in the risk of hunger from 2006 levels the smaller reduction under a2 was attributed to the higher projected future population level in this scenario droughts and agriculture
some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in africa southern europe the middle east most of the americas australia and southeast asia however other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand population growth urban expansion and environmental protection efforts in many areas droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock health

human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns  temperature precipitation sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events  and indirectly through changes in water air and food quality and changes in ecosystems agriculture industry and settlements and the economy  confalonieri et al 2007 393  according to an assessment of the scientific literature by confalonieri et al  2007 393  the effects of climate change to date have been small but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions a study by the   who 2009  estimated the effect of climate change on human health not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates for example the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded climate change was estimated to have been responsible for 3 of  3 of  and 3.8 of  deaths worldwide in 2004 total attributable mortality was about 0.2 of deaths in 2004  of these 85 were child deaths projections
with high confidence authors of the ipcc ar4 synthesis report 48 projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas such as fewer deaths from cold exposure and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of  in  benefits were projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures especially in developing countries with very high confidence confalonieri et al  2007 393 concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change economic growth on its own however was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world s population from disease and injury due to climate change future vulnerability to climate change will depend not only on the extent of social and economic change but also on how the benefits and costs of change are distributed in society for example in the 19th century rapid  in  lead to a plummeting in population health other factors important in determining the health of populations include  the availability of health services and   393

a number of climate-related trends have been observed that affect  these include changes in precipitation the crysosphere and   e.g changes in   observed and projected impacts of climate change on  systems and their management are mainly due to changes in temperature sea level and precipitation variability sea level rise will extend areas of  of  and  resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas in an assessment of the  kundzewicz et al  2007  concluded with high confidence that 

the negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh the benefits all of the regions assessed in the      and        and   and small islands  showed an overall net negative impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystems  and  areas are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change on freshwater with very high confidence it was judged that many of these areas e.g the    and north-eastern  would suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change

 project that the future climate change will bring wetter coasts drier mid-continent areas and further sea level rise such changes could result in the gravest effects of climate change through  millions might be displaced by  river and coastal  or severe  migration related to climate change is likely to be predominantly from  in  to towns and  407 in the short term climate stress is likely to add incrementally to existing migration patterns rather than generating entirely new flows of people 110
it has been argued that environmental degradation loss of access to resources  e.g water resources  and resulting human migration could become a source of political and even  factors other than climate change may however be more important in affecting conflict for example wilbanks et al  2007  suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in africa were more to do with the relative abundance of resources e.g  and  than with resource scarcity scott et al  2001  placed only low confidence in predictions of increased conflict due to climate change a 2013 study found that significant climatic changes were associated with a higher risk of conflict worldwide and predicted that  amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low and high-income countries  similarly a 2014 study found that higher temperatures were associated with a greater likelihood of violent crime and predicted that global warming would cause millions of such crimes in the united states alone during the 21st century military planners are concerned that global warming is a  threat multiplier   whether it is poverty food and  diseases economic instability or threat of natural disasters the broad range of changing climatic conditions may be far reaching these challenges may threaten stability in much of the world  aggregate impacts
main article  
 impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and or regions examples of aggregate measures include   e.g changes in   gdp  and the   changes in ecosystems  e.g changes over land area from one type of vegetation to another  human health impacts and the number of people affected by climate change aggregate measures such as economic cost require researchers to make  over the importance of impacts occurring in different regions and at different times observed impacts
global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather-related events since the 1970s  factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses e.g population growth increased  part of the growth is also related to regional climatic factors e.g changes in precipitation and flooding events it is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend the trend does however suggest increasing vulnerability of social systems to climate change projected impacts
the total economic impacts from climate change are highly uncertain with medium confidence smith et al  2001  concluded that world gdp would change by plus or minus a few percent for a small increase in global mean temperature  up to around 2c relative to the 1990 temperature level  most studies assessed by smith et al  2001  projected losses in world gdp for a medium increase in global mean temperature  above 23c relative to the 1990 temperature level  with increasing losses for greater temperature increases this assessment is consistent with the findings of more recent studies as reviewed by hitz and smith  2004  economic impacts are expected to vary regionally for a medium increase in global mean temperature  23c of warming relative to the average temperature between 19902000  market sectors in low-latitude and less-developed areas might experience net costs due to climate change on the other hand market sectors in high-latitude and developed regions might experience net benefits for this level of warming a global mean temperature increase above about 23c  relative to 19902000  would very likely result in market sectors across all regions experiencing either declines in net benefits or rises in net costs aggregate impacts have also been quantified in non-economic terms for example climate change over the 21st century is likely to adversely affect hundreds of millions of people through increased coastal flooding reductions in water supplies increased malnutrition and increased health impacts biological systems

observed impacts on biological systems




a vast array of physical and biological systems across the earth are being affected by human-induced global warming 

with very high confidence rosenzweig et al  2007  concluded that recent warming had strongly affected natural biological systems hundreds of studies have documented responses of   and  to the climate changes that have already occurred for example in the northern hemisphere species are almost uniformly moving their ranges northward and up in elevation in search of cooler temperatures humans are very likely causing changes in regional temperatures to which plants and animals are responding projected impacts on biological systems

2 levels substantially higher than in the past 650,000 years and global temperatures at least among the highest of those experienced in the past 740,000 years significant disruptions of ecosystems are projected to increase with future climate change examples of disruptions include disturbances such as fire drought pest  invasion of species storms and  events the stresses caused by climate change added to other stresses on ecological systems  e.g land conversion   and   threaten substantial damage to or complete loss of some unique ecosystems and  of some critically endangered species climate change has been estimated to be a major driver of  in cool  forests   systems  in the  and in  in other ecosystems  change may be a stronger driver of biodiversity loss at least in the near-term beyond the year 2050 climate change may be the major driver for biodiversity loss globally a literature assessment by fischlin et al  2007  included a quantitative estimate of the number of species at increased risk of extinction due to climate change with medium confidence it was projected that approximately 20 to 30 of plant and animal species assessed so far  in an unbiased   would likely be at increasingly high risk of extinction should global mean temperatures exceed a warming of 2 to 3c above pre-industrial temperature levels the uncertainties in this estimate however are large  for a rise of about 2c the percentage may be as low as 10 or for about 3c as high as 40 and depending on   all living  of an area the  and  considered as a unit  the range is between 1 and 80 as global average temperature exceeds  above pre-industrial levels model projections suggested that there could be significant extinctions  4070 of species that were assessed  around the globe assessing whether future changes in ecosystems will be beneficial or detrimental is largely based on how ecosystems are valued by human society for increases in global average temperature exceeding 1.5 to 2.5c  relative to global temperatures over the years 19801999  and in concomitant atmospheric co
2 concentrations projected changes in ecosystems will have predominantly negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems goods and  e.g water and food supply abrupt or irreversible changes
physical ecological and social systems may respond in an abrupt  or irregular way to climate change this is as opposed to a smooth or regular response a quantitative entity behaves  irregularly  when its  are   i.e not smooth  nondifferentiable unbounded wildly varying or otherwise ill-defined such behaviour is often termed   irregular behaviour in earth systems may give rise to certain thresholds which when crossed may lead to a large change in the system some singularities could potentially lead to severe impacts at regional or global scales examples of  large-scale  singularities are discussed in the articles on   and  it is possible that human-induced climate change could trigger large-scale singularities but the probabilities of triggering such events are for the most part poorly understood with low to medium confidence smith et al  2001  concluded that a rapid warming of more than 3c above 1990 levels would exceed thresholds that would lead to large-scale discontinuities in the climate system since the assessment by smith et al  2001  improved scientific understanding provides more guidance for two large-scale singularities  the role of  feedbacks in future climate change  discussed below in the section on biogeochemical cycles  and the melting of the  and  biogeochemical cycles

climate change may have an effect on the  in an interactive  feedback  process a feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process a positive feedback intensifies the original process and a negative feedback reduces it 78 models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive 792
using the a2 sres emissions scenario schneider et al  2007 789 found that this effect led to additional warming by the years 20902100  relative to the 19902000  of 0.11.5c this estimate was made with high confidence the climate projections made in the ipcc fourth assessment report summarized earlier of 1.16.4c account for this feedback effect on the other hand with medium confidence schneider et al  2007 789 commented that additional releases of ghgs were possible from permafrost peat lands wetlands and large stores of marine hydrates at high latitudes greenland and west antarctic ice sheets

the atlantic meridional overturning circulation  amoc  is an important component of the earth s climate system characterized by a northward flow of warm salty water in the upper layers of the  and a southward flow of colder water in the deep atlantic 5 the amoc is equivalently known as the   thc  potential impacts associated with moc changes include reduced warming or  in the case of abrupt change  absolute cooling of northern high-latitude areas near  and north-western europe an increased warming of  high-latitudes tropical drying as well as changes to  terrestrial vegetation oceanic co

irreversibilities
commitment to radiative forcing
emissions of ghgs are a potentially irreversible commitment to sustained  in the future the contribution of a ghg to radiative forcing depends on the gas s ability to trap   heat  radiation the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere and the length of time the gas resides in the atmosphere co
2 is the most important anthropogenic ghg while more than half of the co
2 emitted is currently removed from the atmosphere within a century some fraction  about 20  of emitted co
2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years consequently co
2 emitted today is potentially an irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing over thousands of years this commitment may not be truly irreversible should techniques be developed to remove co
2 or other ghgs directly from the atmosphere or to block sunlight to induce cooling techniques of this sort are referred to as  little is known about the effectiveness costs or potential  of geoengineering options some geoengineering options such as blocking sunlight would not prevent further  irreversible impacts
human-induced climate change may lead to irreversible impacts on physical biological and social systems there are a number of examples of climate change impacts that may be irreversible at least over the timescale of many human generations these include the large-scale singularities described above  changes in carbon cycle feedbacks the melting of the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets and changes to the amoc in biological systems the extinction of species would be an irreversible impact in social systems unique  may be lost due to climate change for example humans living on  islands face risks due to sea-level rise sea-surface warming and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events benefits of global warming
in some locations and industries global warming may increase productivity though the ipcc cautions that  estimates agree on the size of the impact  small relative to economic growth  and 17 of the 20 impact estimates shown in figure 10-1 are negative losses accelerate with greater warming and estimates diverge  the identified benefits are listed below co2 fertilisation effect
 is one of the substances which plants require to grow increasing its amount in the air contributes to 

improved agriculture in some high latitude regions 
increased growing season in  
increased productivity of  trees 
increased vegetation activity in high northern latitudes 
increased plankton biomass in the north pacific subtropical gyre 
recent increase in forest growth 
increased arctic tundra plant reproduction 

human health

winter deaths might decline as temperatures warm however this is disputed for at least some regions for example states  although excess winter deaths evidently do exist winter cold severity no longer predicts the numbers affected we conclude that no evidence exists that excess winter deaths in england and wales will fall if winters warm with climate change

scientific opinion
the   ipcc  has published several major assessments on the effects of global warming its most recent comprehensive impact assessment was published in 2014 publications describing the effects of climate change have also been produced by the following organizations 

  aaas 
a report by the  the  and 
uk avoid research programme
a report by the uk  and 
 climate change research centre


a report by molina et al  no date  states 

the overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change documents both current impacts with significant costs and extraordinary future risks to society and natural systems

nasa data and tools
nasa has released public data and tools to predict how temperature and rainfall patterns worldwide may change through to the year 2100 caused by increasing carbon dioxide in earths atmosphere the dataset shows projected changes worldwide on a regional level simulated by 21 climate models the data can be viewed on a daily timescale for individual cities and towns and may be used to conduct climate risk assessments to predict the local and global effects of weather dangers for example droughts floods heat waves and declines in agriculture productivity and help plan responses to global warming effects see also




footnotes
1 the tar and ar4 that are referred to in this article use specific and quantitative language to describe uncertainty this language is intended to provide an indication of the level of confidence that ipcc authors have about a particular finding the qualitative language used to describe uncertainty has a quantitative scale associated with it the quantitative values for qualitative terms are intended to ensure that confidence levels are interpreted correctly the is because qualitative statements e.g using the word  likely  can be interpreted differently in quantitative terms 44
confidence levels used in the tar 

very high   95 or greater
high   6795 medium   3367 low   533 very low   5 or less

confidence statements made in ar4 are listed below 

very high confidence  at least 9 out of 10 chance of being correct
high confidence  about 8 out of 10 chance      
medium confidence  about 5 out of 10 chance      
low confidence  about 2 out of 10 chance      
very low confidence  less than a 1 out of 10 chance      

ipcc  2012  uses the following terms   very low   low   medium   high  and  very high confidence  unlike the tar and ar4 the scale is qualitative rather than quantitative the quantitative values used by ipcc authors are  subjective  probabilities also known as  personalist  or   probabilities and reflect the expert judgement of ipcc authors in this formulation probability is not only a function of an event but also the state of information that is available to the person making the assessment in this framework assigned probabilities may change as more or different information becomes available the ipcc also uses another scale to describe the likelihood of a particular event occurring this is different from the confidence scales described above and it is possible to assign confidence values to statements of likelihood for example the judgement that an event is improbable  e.g rolling a  twice and getting a six both times  may be assigned a high level of scientific confidence also the probability that an event has an even chance of occurring  e.g a tossed  coming up heads  may also be assigned a high level of confidence notes
