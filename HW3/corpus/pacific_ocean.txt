the quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east pacific ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012 marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles the main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste the rivers then empty into the ocean often also bringing chemicals used as  in agriculture the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to  and the creation of a   also known as marine litter is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake sea ocean or waterway oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter in addition the pacific ocean has served as the crash site of satellites including   and  major ports and harbors
