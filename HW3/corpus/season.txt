axis tilt 
the seasons result from the earth s  being  with respect to its  by an angle of approximately 23.5   this tilt is also known as  obliquity of the   
regardless of the time of year the  and southern hemispheres always experience opposite seasons this is because during summer or winter one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun  see fig 1  than the other and this exposure alternates as the earth revolves in its orbit for approximately half of the year  from around march 20 to around september 22  the northern hemisphere tips toward the sun with the maximum amount occurring on about june 21 for the other half of the year the same happens but in the southern hemisphere instead of the northern with the maximum around december 21 the two instants when the sun is directly overhead at the equator are the equinoxes also at that moment both the  and the  of the earth are just on the  and hence day and night are equally divided between the northern and southern hemispheres around the march equinox the northern hemisphere will be experiencing spring as the hours of daylight increase and the southern hemisphere is experiencing autumn as daylight hours shorten the effect of axial tilt is observable as the change in  and  of the sun at   the  of the sun  during a  the low angle of sun during the winter months means that incoming rays of solar radiation are  so the light received is more indirect and of lower intensity between this effect and the shorter daylight hours the axial tilt of the earth accounts for most of the seasonal variation in climate in both hemispheres

elliptical earth orbit 
compared to axial tilt other factors contribute little to seasonal temperature changes the seasons are not the result of the variation in earth s distance to the sun because of its elliptical orbit in fact earth reaches   the point in its orbit closest to the sun  in january and it reaches   farthest point from the sun  in july so the slight contribution of orbital eccentricity opposes the temperature trends of the seasons in the northern hemisphere in general the effect of orbital eccentricity on earth s seasons is a 7 variation in sunlight received

 can influence temperatures but on earth this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors  research shows that the earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when farther from the sun this is because the northern hemisphere has more land than the southern and land warms more readily than sea any noticeable intensification of the southern hemisphere s winters and summers due to earth s elliptical orbit is mitigated by the abundance of water in the southern hemisphere maritime and hemispheric 
seasonal weather fluctuations  changes  also depend on factors such as proximity to  or other large bodies of water  in those oceans  enso and other oceanic cycles and prevailing

in the temperate and polar regions seasons are marked by changes in the amount of  which in turn often causes  of dormancy in plants and  in animals these effects vary with latitude and with proximity to bodies of water for example the south pole is in the middle of the continent of  and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans the north pole is in the  and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the water the result is that the south pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the north pole during the northern winter the cycle of seasons in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that in the other when it is summer in the northern hemisphere it is winter in the southern hemisphere and vice versa tropics 
in  and  regions there is little annual fluctuation of sunlight however there are seasonal shifts of a rainy global-scale low pressure belt called the  as a result the amount of  tends to vary more dramatically than the average temperature when the convergence zone is north of the equator the tropical areas of the northern hemisphere experience their wet season while the tropics south of the equator have their dry season this pattern reverses when the convergence zone migrates to a position south of the equator mid-latitude thermal lag 
in meteorological terms the summer  and winter solstice  or the maximum and minimum  respectively  do not fall in the middles of summer and winter the heights of these seasons occur up to seven weeks later because of seasonal lag seasons though are not always defined in meteorological terms in  reckoning by hours of daylight alone the solstices and equinoxes are in the middle of the respective seasons because of seasonal lag due to thermal absorption and release by the oceans regions with a continental climate which predominate in the northern hemisphere often consider these four dates to be the start of the seasons as in the diagram with the  considered seasonal midpoints the length of these seasons is not uniform because of the elliptical orbit of the earth and its  four-season calendar reckoning 
calendar-based reckoning defines the seasons in absolute rather than relative terms accordingly if floral activity is regularly observed during the coolest quarter of the year in a particular area it is still considered winter despite the traditional association of flowers with spring and summer additionally the seasons are considered to change on the same dates everywhere that uses a particular calendar method regardless of variations in climate from one area to another most calendar-based methods use a four-season model to identify the warmest and coldest seasons which are separated by two intermediate seasons

meteorological 




animation of seasonal differences especially  cover through the year


meteorological seasons are reckoned by temperature with summer being the hottest quarter of the year and winter the coldest quarter of the year in 1780 the societas meteorologica palatina  which became defunct in 1795  an early international organization for meteorology defined seasons as groupings of three whole months as identified by the gregorian calendar ever since professional meteorologists all over the world have used this definition therefore for temperate areas in the northern hemisphere spring begins on 1 march summer on 1 june autumn on 1 september and winter on 1 december for the southern hemisphere temperate zone spring begins on 1 september summer on 1 december autumn on 1 march and winter on 1 june in australasia the meteorological terms for seasons apply to the temperate zone that occupies all of     the south-eastern corner of  and the south-west of western australia and the south east  areas south of  




a tree in summer


in sweden and finland meteorologists use a non-calendar based  for the seasons based on the temperature spring begins when the daily averaged temperature permanently rises above 0c summer begins when the temperature permanently rises above  10c summer ends when the temperature permanently falls below  10c and winter begins when the temperature permanently falls below 0c  permanently  here means that the daily averaged temperature has remained above or below the limit for seven consecutive days this implies two things  first the seasons do not begin at fixed dates but must be determined by observation and are known only after the fact  and second a new season begins at different dates in different parts of the country in great britain the onset of spring used to be defined as when the maximum daily temperature reached 50f  10c  in a defined sequence of days this almost always occurred in march however with global warming this temperature is now not uncommon in the winter 
astronomical 

astronomical timing as the basis for designating the temperate seasons dates back at least to the julian calendar used by the ancient romans it continues to be used on many modern gregorian calendars worldwide although some countries like australia new zealand and russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning the precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the tropics of cancer and capricorn for the solstices and the times of the sun s transit over the equator for the  or a traditional date close to these times the following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of  of earth s elliptical orbit the orbital ellipse  with eccentricity exaggerated for effect  goes through each of the six earth images which are sequentially the   periapsisnearest point to the sun  on anywhere from 2 january to 5 january the point of march equinox on 19 20 or 21 march the point of june solstice on 20 or 21 june the   apoapsisfarthest point from the sun  on anywhere from 4 july to 7 july the september equinox on 22 or 23 september and the december solstice on 21 or 22 december 




note  distances are exaggerated and not to scale



these  astronomical  seasons are not of equal length because of the  of the orbit of the earth as discovered by  from the march equinox it currently takes 92.75 days until the june solstice then 93.65 days until the september equinox 89.85 days until the december solstice and finally 88.99 days until the march equinox variation due to calendar misalignment 
the times of the equinoxes and solstices are not fixed with respect to the modern gregorian calendar but fall about six hours later every year amounting to one full day in four years they are reset by the occurrence of a leap year the gregorian calendar is designed to keep the march equinox no later than 21 march as accurately as is practical also see   the calendar equinox  used in the calculation of easter  is 21 march the same date as in the easter tables current at the time of the council of nicaea in ad 325 the calendar is therefore framed to prevent the astronomical equinox wandering onto 22 march from nicaea to the date of the reform the years 500 600 700 900 1000 1100 1300 1400 and 1500 which would not have been leap years in the gregorian calendar amount to nine days but astronomers directed that ten days be removed currently the most common equinox and solstice dates are march 20 june 21 september 22 or 23 and december 21  the four-year average slowly shifts to earlier times as the century progresses this shift is a full day in about 128 years  compensated mainly by the century  leap year  rules of the gregorian calendar  and as 2000 was a leap year the current shift has been progressing since the beginning of the last century when equinoxes and solstices were relatively late this also means that in many years of the twentieth century the dates of march 21 june 22 september 23 and december 22 were much more common so older books teach  and older people may still remember  these dates note that all the times are given in   roughly speaking the time at  ignoring british summer time  people living farther to the east  asia and australia  whose local times are in advance will see the astronomical seasons apparently start later  for example in   utc 13  an equinox occurred on september 24 1999 a date which will not crop up again until 2103 on the other hand people living far to the west  america  whose clocks run behind utc may experience an equinox as early as march 19 change over time 
over thousands of years the earth s  and orbital eccentricity vary  see   the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars while the perihelion and aphelion move eastward thus ten thousand years from now earth s northern winter will occur at aphelion and northern summer at perihelion the severity of seasonal change  the average temperature difference between summer and winter in location  will also change over time because the earth s axial tilt fluctuates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees smaller irregularities in the times are caused by perturbations of the moon and the other planets

the annual cycle of insolation  sun energy shown in blue  with key points for seasons  middle    top  and   bottom  along with months  lower  and zodiac houses  upper  the cycle of temperature  shown in pink  is delayed by  

solar timing is based on insolation in which the solstices and equinoxes are seen as the midpoints of the seasons it was the method for reckoning seasons in medieval europe especially by the  and is still ceremonially observed in some east asian countries summer is defined as the quarter of the year with the greatest insolation and winter as the quarter with the least the solar seasons change at the cross-quarter days which are about 34 weeks earlier than the meteorological seasons and 67 weeks earlier than seasons starting at equinoxes and solstices thus the day of greatest insolation is designated  midsummer  as noted in  s play  which is set on the summer solstice on the celtic calendar the traditional first day of winter is 1 november   the celtic origin of   spring starts 1 february   the celtic origin of   summer begins 1 may   the celtic origin of   the first day of autumn is 1 august  celtic   the celtic dates corresponded to four  agricultural festivals the  forms the basis of other such systems in  its seasons are traditionally based on 24 periods known as  the four seasons chn   xi   qi   and dng   are universally translated as  spring   summer   autumn  and  winter  but actually begin much earlier with the solstices and equinoxes forming the midpoint of each season rather than their start astronomically the seasons are said to begin on lichun   lit standing spring  on about 4 february lixia   on about 6 may liqiu   on about 8 august and lidong   on about 7 november these dates were not part of the traditional lunar calendar however and moveable holidays such as  and the  are more closely associated with the seasons six-season calendar reckoning 
some calendars in south asia use a six-season method where the number of seasons between summer and winter can number from one to three the dates are fixed at even intervals of months in the  of tropical and subtropical india there are six seasons or  that are calendar-based in the sense of having fixed dates    spring  greeshma  summer       autumn  hemanta  early winter  and shishira  prevernal or late winter  the six seasons are ascribed to two months each of the twelve months in the hindu calendar the rough correspondences are 

the  is similar but differs in start and end times it has the following seasons or ritu 

the  follows a similar pattern of six seasons

polar day and night 
any point north of the  or south of the  will have one period in the summer when the sun does not set and one period in the winter when the sun does not rise at progressively higher latitudes the maximum periods of   and   are progressively longer for example at the military and weather station  located at 823005n and 622020w on the northern tip of    about 450  or 830km from the north pole  the sun begins to peek above the horizon for minutes per day at the end of february and each day it climbs higher and stays up longer  by 21 march the sun is up for over 12 hours on 6 april the sun rises at 0522  and remains above the horizon until it sets below the horizon again on 6 september at 0335 utc by october 13 the sun is above the horizon for only 1 hour 30 minutes and on october 14 it does not rise above the horizon at all and remains below the horizon until it rises again on 27 february first light comes in late january because the sky has  being a glow on the horizon for increasing hours each day for more than a month before the sun first appears with its disc above the horizon from mid-november to mid-january there is no twilight in the weeks surrounding 21 june in the northern polar region the sun is at its highest elevation appearing to circle the sky there without going below the horizon eventually it does go below the horizon for progressively longer periods each day until around the middle of october when it disappears for the last time until the following february for a few more weeks  day  is marked by decreasing periods of twilight eventually from mid-november to mid-january there is no twilight and it is continuously dark in mid january the first faint wash of twilight briefly touches the horizon  for just minutes per day  and then twilight increases in duration with increasing brightness each day until sunrise at end of february then on 6 april the sun remains above the horizon until mid october non-calendar-based reckoning 








seasonal changes regarding a tree over a year


ecologically speaking a season is a period of the year in which only certain types of floral and animal events happen  e.g  flowers bloomspring   hibernatewinter  so if we can observe a change in daily floral animal events the season is changing in this sense ecological seasons are defined in absolute terms unlike calendar-based methods in which the seasons are relative if specific conditions associated with a particular ecological season don t normally occur in a particular region then that area cannot be said to experience that season on a regular basis modern mid-latitude ecological 
six seasons can be distinguished which do not have fixed calendar-based dates like the meteorological and astronomical seasons  regions tend to experience the beginning of the hibernal season up to a month later than  conversely prevernal and vernal seasons begin up to a month earlier near oceanic and coastal areas for example prevernal  blooms typically appear as early as february in coastal areas of  the  but generally don t appear until march or april in locations like the  usa or parts of eastern  the actual dates for each season vary by climate region and can shift from one year to the next average dates listed here are for mild and cool temperate climate zones in the northern hemisphere 

prevernal  early or pre-spring  begins february  mild temperate  to march  cool temperate  deciduous tree buds begin to swell some types of migrating birds fly from winter to summer habitats vernal  spring  begins mid march  mild temperate  to late april  cool temperate  tree buds burst into leaves birds establish territories and begin mating and nesting estival  high summer  begins june in most temperate climates trees in full leaf birds hatch and raise offspring serotinal  late summer  generally begins mid to late august deciduous leaves begin to change color in higher latitude locations  above 45 north  young birds reach maturity and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration the traditional  harvest season  begins by early september autumnal  autumn  generally begins mid to late september tree leaves in full color then turn brown and fall to the ground birds migrate back to wintering areas hibernal  winter  begins december  mild temperate  november  cool temperate  deciduous trees are bare and fallen leaves begin to decay migrating birds settled in winter habitats 
tropical ecological 
in the tropics where seasonal dates also vary it is more common to speak of the   or wet or   season versus the  for example in  the dry season  november to april  is called  summer  and the rainy season  may to october  is called  winter  even though it is located in the northern hemisphere in some tropical areas a three-way division into hot rainy and cool season is used there is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight at different times of the year however many regions  such as the northern   are subject to   and wind cycles floral and animal activity variation near the equator depends more on wet dry cycles than seasonal temperature variations with different species flowering  or emerging from cocoons  at specific times before during or after the monsoon season thus the tropics are characterized by numerous  mini-seasons  within the larger seasonal blocks of time in the tropical parts of australia in the northern parts of   and the  wet and dry seasons are observed in addition to or in place of temperate season names indigenous ecological 
see also  
indigenous people in polar temperate and tropical climates of northern eurasia the americas africa oceania and australia have traditionally defined the seasons ecologically by observing the activity of the plants animals and weather around them each separate tribal group traditionally observes different seasons determined according to local criteria that can vary from the hibernation of polar bears on the arctic tundras to the growing seasons of plants in the tropical rainforests in australia some tribes have up to eight seasons in a year as do the sami people in scandinavia many indigenous people who no longer live directly off the land in traditional often nomadic styles now observe modern methods of seasonal reckoning according to what is customary in their particular country or region  official  designations 
as noted a variety of dates are used in different countries to mark the changes of seasons especially those that are calendar based these observances are often declared  official  within their respective jurisdictions by the local or national media even when the weather or climate is contradictory however they are mainly a matter of custom only and have not generally been proclaimed by governments north or south of the equator for civil purposes see also
