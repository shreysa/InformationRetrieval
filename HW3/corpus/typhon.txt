typhon      tuphn   also typhoeus    tupheus  typhaon   tuphan  or typhos   tuphs  was a monstrous serpentine giant and the most deadly creature in  according to  typhon was the son of  and  however one source has typhon as the son of  alone while another makes typhon the offspring of  typhon and his mate  were the progenitors of many famous monsters typhon attempted to overthrow  for the supremacy of the cosmos the two fought a cataclysmic battle which zeus finally won with the aid of his thunderbolts defeated typhon was cast into tartarus or buried underneath mount etna or the island of  typhon mythology is part of the greek succession myth which explained how zeus came to rule the gods typhon s story is also connected with that of python  the serpent killed by   and both stories probably derived from several near eastern antecedents typhon was  from c 500 bc  also identified with the egyptian god of destruction  in later accounts typhon was often confused with the

mythology
according to  s   c 8th  7th century bc  typhon was the son of   earth  and    when  had driven the  from heaven huge earth bore her youngest child typhoeus of the love of tartarus by the aid of golden   the mythographer   1st or 2nd century ad  adds that gaia bore typhon in anger at the gods for their destruction of her offspring the  numerous other sources mention typhon as being the offspring of gaia or simply  earth-born  with no mention of tartarus however according to the   6th century bc  typhon was the child of  alone hera angry at zeus for having given birth to  by himself prayed to gaia  and the titans to give her a son stronger than zeus then slapped the ground and became pregnant hera gave the infant typhon to the serpent  to raise and typhon grew up to become a great bane to mortals 



depiction by 


several sources locate typhon s birth and dwelling place in  and in particular the region in the vicinity of the ancient cilician coastal city of   modern  turkey  the poet   c 470 bc  calls typhon  cilician  and says that typhon was born in cilicia and nurtured in  the famous cilician cave  an apparent allusion to the  in turkey in    typhon is called the  dweller of the cilician caves  and both apollodorus and the poet   4th or 5th century ad  have typhon born in cilicia the b scholia to  2.783 preserving a possibly  tradition has typhon born in cilicia as the offspring of  gaia angry at the destruction of the giants slanders zeus to hera so hera goes to zeus  father cronus  whom zeus had overthrown  and cronus gives hera two eggs smeared with his own semen telling her to bury them and that from them would be born one who would overthrow zeus hera angry at zeus buries the eggs in cilicia  under arimon  but when typhon is born hera now reconciled with zeus informs him descriptions 
according to  typhon was  terrible outrageous and lawless  immensely powerful and on his shoulders were one hundred snake heads that emitted fire and every kind of noise 

strength was with his hands in all that he did and the feet of the strong god were untiring from his shoulders grew a hundred heads of a snake a fearful dragon with dark flickering tongues and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvellous heads flashed fire and fire burned from his heads as he glared and there were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of sound unspeakable  for at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood but at another the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud ungovernable fury  and at another the sound of a lion relentless of heart  and at another sounds like whelps wonderful to hear  and again at another he would hiss so that the high mountains re-echoed 
the  describes typhon as  fell  and  cruel  and neither like gods nor men three of  s poems have typhon as hundred-headed  as in hesiod  while apparently a fourth gives him only fifty heads but a hundred heads for typhon became standard a    c 540530 bc  depicts typhon as a winged humanoid from the waist up with two snake tails below  calls typhon  fire-breathing  for   2nd century bc  typhon was a monster of enormous strength and strange appearance with many heads hands and wings and with huge snake coils coming from his thighs apollodorus describes typhon as a huge winged monster whose head  brushed the stars  human in form above the waist with snake coils below and fire flashing from his eyes 

in size and strength he surpassed all the offspring of earth as far as the thighs he was of human shape and of such prodigious bulk that he out-topped all the mountains and his head often brushed the stars one of his hands reached out to the west and the other to the east and from them projected a hundred dragons  heads from the thighs downward he had huge coils of vipers which when drawn out reached to his very head and emitted a loud hissing his body was all winged  unkempt hair streamed on the wind from his head and cheeks  and fire flashed from his eyes 
the most elaborate description of typhon is found in  s  nonnus makes numerous references to typhon s serpentine nature giving him a  tangled army of snakes  snaky feet and hair according to nonnus typhon was a  poison-spitting viper  whose  every hair belched viper-poison  and typhon  spat out showers of poison from his throat  the mountain torrents were swollen as the monster showered fountains from the viperish bristles of his high head  and  the water-snakes of the monster s viperish feet crawl into the caverns underground spitting poison  following hesiod and others nonnus gives typhon many heads  though untotaled  but in addition to snake heads nonnus also gives typhon many other animal heads including leopards lions bulls boars bears cattle wolves and dogs which combine to make  the cries of all wild beasts together  and a  babel of screaming sounds  nonnus also gives typhon  legions of arms innumerable  and where nicander had only said that typhon had  many  hands and ovid had given typhon a hundred hands nonnus gives typhon two hundred offspring 
according to  s  typhon  was joined in love  to  a monstrous half-woman and half-snake who bore typhon  fierce offspring  first according to hesiod there was  the two-headed dog who guarded the cattle of  second  the multiheaded dog who guarded the gates of  and third the  the many-headed serpent who when one of its heads was cut off grew two more the theogony next mentions an ambiguous  she  which might refer to echidna as the mother of the   a fire-breathing beast that was part lion part goat and had a snake-headed tail  with typhon then being the father while mentioning cerberus and  other monsters  as being the offspring of echidna and typhon the mythographer   6th century bc  adds the  that ate the liver of  the mythographer   5th century bc  also names prometheus  eagle and adds   though pherecydes does not use this name  and the dragon that guarded the  in the   according to hesiod the offspring of ceto and phorcys  the lyric poet lasus of hermione  6th century bc  adds the sphinx later authors mostly retain these offspring of typhon by echidna while adding others  in addition to naming as their offspring orthrus the chimera  citing hesiod as his source  the caucasian eagle ladon and the sphinx also adds the nemean lion  no mother is given  and the  killed by the hero   unmentioned by hesiod    1st century bc  in his list of offspring of typhon  all by echidna  retains from the above  cerberus the chimera the sphinx the hydra and ladon and adds  gorgon   by which hyginus means the mother of  whereas hesiod s three  of which medusa was one were the daughters of ceto and phorcys  the  that guarded the  and  the  in hesiod the daughters of  and the   in one source are said to be the daughters of typhon the sea serpents which attacked the trojan priest  during the  were perhaps supposed to be the progeny of typhon and echidna according to hesiod the defeated typhon is the source of destructive storm winds battle with zeus 
typhon challenged  for rule of the cosmos the earliest mention of typhon and his only occurrence in  is a passing reference in the  to zeus striking the ground around where typhon lies defeated  s  gives us the first account of their battle according to hesiod without the quick action of zeus typhon would have  come to reign over mortals and immortals  in the theogony zeus and typhon meet in cataclysmic conflict 

 thundered hard and mightily  and the earth around resounded terribly and the wide heaven above and the sea and ocean s streams and the nether parts of the earth great olympus reeled beneath the divine feet of the king as he arose and earth groaned thereat and through the two of them heat took hold on the dark-blue sea through the thunder and lightning and through the fire from the monster and the scorching winds and blazing thunderbolt the whole earth seethed and sky and sea  and the long waves raged along the beaches round and about at the rush of the deathless gods  and there arose an endless shaking hades trembled where he rules over the dead below and the titans under tartarus who live with cronos because of the unending clamor and the fearful strife 
zeus with his thunderbolt easily overcomes typhon who is thrown down to earth in a fiery crash 

so when zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt he leaped from olympus and struck him and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him but when zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes typhoeus was hurled down a maimed wreck so that the huge earth groaned and flame shot forth from the thunderstricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount when he was smitten a great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapor and melted as tin melts when heated by men s art in channelled crucibles  or as iron which is hardest of all things is shortened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of hephaestus even so then the earth melted in the glow of the blazing fire 
defeated typhon is cast into  by an angry zeus   7th or 6th century bc  seemingly knew a different version of the story in which typhon enters zeus  palace while zeus is asleep but zeus awakes and kills typhon with a thunderbolt  apparently knew of a tradition which had the gods in order to escape from typhon transform themselves into animals and flee to egypt  calls typhon the  enemy of the gods  and says that he was defeated by zeus  thunderbolt in one poem pindar has typhon being held prisoner by zeus under etna and in another says that typhon  lies in dread tartarus  stretched out underground between mount etna and  in aeschylus  prometheus bound a  hissing  typhon his eyes flashing  withstood all the gods  but  the unsleeping bolt of zeus  struck him and  he was burnt to ashes and his strength blasted from him by the lightning bolt 
according to  during his battle with zeus typhon first flees to the  which begins to burn then to the volcanic island of pithecussae  modern   off the coast of cumae where he is buried under the island   3rd century bc  like pherecydes presents a multi-stage battle with typhon being struck by zeus  thunderbolt on mount  before fleeing to the mountains and plain of nysa and ending up  as already mentioned by the fifth-century bc greek historian   buried under  in egypt like pindar  has all the gods but zeus and  transform into animal forms and flee to egypt   became a hawk  an ibis  a fish  a cat  a goat  a fawn  an ox and  a mouse the geographer   c 20 ad  gives several locations which were associated with the battle according to strabo typhon was said to have cut the serpentine channel of the  which flowed beneath the  mount kasios  modern   while fleeing from zeus and some placed the battle at   burnt land  a volcanic plain on the upper  between the ancient kingdoms of   and  near   modern bozda  and  the ancient capital of lydia in the versions of the battle given by hesiod aeschylus and pindar zeus  defeat of typhon is straightforward however a more involved version of the battle is given by apollodorus no early source gives any reason for the conflict but apollodorus  account seemingly implies that typhon had been produced by gaia to avenge the destruction by zeus and the other gods of the giants a previous generation of offspring of gaia according to apollodorus typhon  hurling kindled rocks  attacked the gods  with hissings and shouts spouting a great jet of fire from his mouth  seeing this the gods transformed into animals and fled to egypt  as in pindar and nicander  however  zeus pelted typhon at a distance with thunderbolts and at close quarters struck him down with an adamantine sickle  wounded typhon fled to the syrian mount kasios where zeus  grappled  with him but typhon twining his snaky coils around zeus was able to wrest away the sickle and cut the sinews from zeus  hands and feet typhon carried the disabled zeus across the sea to the  in cilicia where he set the she-serpent  to guard over zeus and his severed sinews which typhon had hidden in a bearskin but  and   possibly another name for   stole the sinews and gave them back to zeus his strength restored zeus chased typhon to mount nysa where the  tricked typhon into eating  ephemeral fruits  which weakened him typhon then fled to  where he threw mountains at zeus which were turned back on him by zeus  thunderbolts and the mountain where typhon stood being drenched with typhon s blood became known as mount haemus  bloody mountain  typhon then fled to  where zeus threw  on top of typhon burying him and so finally defeated him   2nd century ad  says that pan helped zeus in the battle by tricking typhon to come out from his lair and into the open by the  promise of a banquet of fish  thus enabling zeus to defeat typhon with his thunderbolts nonnus s dionysiaca 
the longest and most involved version of the battle appears in  s   late 4th or early 5th century ad  zeus hides his thunderbolts in a cave so that he might seduce the maiden  and so produce  but smoke rising from the thunderbolts enables typhon under the guidance of gaia to locate zeus s weapons steal them and hide them in another cave immediately typhon extends  his clambering hands into the upper air  and begins a long and concerted attack upon the heavens then  leaving the air  he turns his attack upon the seas finally typhon attempts to wield zeus  thunderbolts but they  felt the hands of a novice and all their manly blaze was unmanned 
now zeus  sinews had somehow  nonnus does not say how or when  fallen to the ground during their battle and typhon had taken them also but zeus devises a plan with  and  to beguile typhon cadmus desguised as a shepherd enchants typhon by playing the panpipes and typhon entrusting the thuderbolts to gaia sets out to find the source of the music he hears finding cadmus he challenges him to a contest offering cadmus any goddess as wife excepting hera whom typhon has reserved for himself cadmus then tells typhon that if he liked the  little tune  of his pipes then he would love the music of his lyre  if only it could be strung with zeus  sinews so typhon retrieves the sinews and gives them to cadmus who hides them in another cave and again begins to play his bewitching pipes so that  typhoeus yielded his whole soul to cadmos for the melody to charm  with typhon distracted zeus takes back his thunderbolts cadmus stops playing and typhon released from his spell rushes back to his cave to discover the thunderbolts gone incensed typhon unleashes devastation upon the world  animals are devoured  typhon s many animal heads each eat animals of its own kind  rivers turned to dust seas made dry land and the land  laid waste  the day ends with typhon yet unchallenged and while the other gods  moved about the cloudless nile  zeus waits through the night for the coming dawn victory  reproaches  zeus urging him to  stand up as champion of your own children  dawn comes and typhon roars out a challenge to zeus and a cataclysmic battle for  the sceptre and throne of zeus  is joined typhon piles up mountains as battlements and with his  legions of arms innumerable  showers volley after volley of trees and rocks at zeus but all are destroyed or blown aside or dodged or thrown back at typhon typhon throws torrents of water at zeus  thunderbolts to quench them but zeus is able to cut off some of typhon s hands with  frozen volleys of air as by a knife  and hurling thunderbolts is able to burn more of typhon s  endless hands  and cut off some of his  countless heads  typhon is attacked by the four winds and  frozen volleys of jagged hailstones  gaia tries to aid her burnt and frozen son finally typhon falls and zeus shouts out a long stream of mocking taunts telling typhon that he is to be buried under sicily s hills with a  over him which will read  this is the barrow of typhoeus son of earth who once lashed the sky with stones and the fire of heaven burnt him up  burial and cause of volcanic activity
most accounts have the defeated typhon buried under either  in  or the volcanic island of  the largest of the  off the coast of  with typhon being the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes though hesiod has typhon simply cast into  by zeus some have read a reference to mount etna in hesiod s description of typhon s fall 

and flame shot forth from the thunderstricken lord in the dim rugged glens of the mount when he was smitten a great part of huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapor and melted as tin melts when heated by men s art in channelled crucibles  or as iron which is hardest of all things is shortened by glowing fire in mountain glens and melts in the divine earth through the strength of hephaestus even so then the earth melted in the glow of the blazing fire 
the first certain references to typhon buried under etna as well as being the cause of its eruptions occur in pindar 

son of cronus you who hold aetna the wind-swept weight on terrible hundred-headed typhon 

and 

among them is he who lies in dread tartarus that enemy of the gods typhon with his hundred heads once the famous cilician cave nurtured him but now the sea-girt cliffs above cumae and sicily too lie heavy on his shaggy chest and the pillar of the sky holds him down snow-covered aetna year-round nurse of bitter frost from whose inmost caves belch forth the purest streams of unapproachable fire in the daytime her rivers roll out a fiery flood of smoke while in the darkness of night the crimson flame hurls rocks down to the deep plain of the sea with a crashing roar that monster shoots up the most terrible jets of fire  it is a marvellous wonder to see and a marvel even to hear about when men are present such a creature is bound beneath the dark and leafy heights of aetna and beneath the plain and his bed scratches and goads the whole length of his back stretched out against it 
thus pindar has typhon in tartarus and buried under not just etna but under a vast volcanic region stretching from sicily to   in the vicinity of modern   a region which presumably also included  as well as ischia many subsequent accounts mention either etna or ischia in  typhon is imprisoned underneath etna while above him   hammers the molten ore  and in his rage the  charred  typhon causes  rivers of fire  to pour forth  has typhon buried under all of sicily with his left and right hands under  and  his feet under  and his head under etna  where he  vomits flames from his ferocious mouth  and  has typhon s head under etna and all of sicily shaken when typhon  struggles   has both typhon and  buried under the island of ischia   and  all calling the island  inarime  have typhon buried there strabo calling ischia  pithecussae  reports the  myth  that typhon lay buried there and that when he  turns his body the flames and the waters and sometimes even small islands containing boiling water spout forth 
in addition to typhon other mythological beings were also said to be buried under mount etna and the cause of its volcanic activity most notably the giant  was said to be entombed under etna the volcano s eruptions being the breath of enceladus and its tremors caused by the giant rolling over from side to side beneath the mountain also said to be buried under etna were the hundred-hander  and asteropus who was perhaps one of the  boeotia 
typhon s final resting place was apparently also said to be in  the   names a mountain near  typhaonium perhaps reflecting an early tradition which also had typhon buried under a  mountain and some apparently claimed that typhon was buried beneath a mountain in boeotia from which came exhaltations of fire  couch of typhoeus 
homer describes a place he calls the  couch  of typhoeus  which he locates in the land of the arimoi     where zeus lashes the land about typhoeus with his thunderbolts presumably this is the same land where according to hesiod typhon s mate echidna keeps guard  in arima      but neither homer nor hesiod say anything more about where these arimoi or this arima might be the question of whether an historical place was meant and its possible location has been since ancient times the subject of speculation and debate  discusses the question in some detail several locales    and the island of  all places associated with typhon are given by strabo as possible locations for homer s  arimoi   has his cilician typhon slain by zeus  among the arimoi  and the historian   4th century bc  located the arimoi and the arima mountains in cilicia near the  river the corycian cave and the sarpedon promomtory the b scholia to  2.783 mentioned above says typhon was born in cilicia  under arimon  and  mentions typhon s  bloodstained cave of arima  in cilicia just across the  from  in ancient syria was mount kasios  modern   and the  sites associated with typhon s battle with zeus and according to strabo the historian   c 2nd century bc  identified the arimoi with the  of syria alternatively according to strabo some placed the arimoi at catacecaumene while   5th century bc  added that  a certain arimus  ruled there strabo also tells us that for  some  homer s  couch of typhon  was located  in a wooded place in the fertile land of hyde  with hyde being another name for   or its acropolis  and that   2nd century bc  thought that the arimoi were most plausibly located  in the catacecaumene country in mysia  the 3rd-century bc poet  placed the lair of typhons  mate echidna in this region another place mentioned by strabo as being associated with arima is the island of  where according to  typhon had fled and in the area where pindar and others had said typhon was buried the connection to arima comes from the island s greek name pithecussae which derives from the greek word for monkey and according to strabo residents of the island said that  arimoi  was also the etruscan word for monkeys name 
typhon s name has a number of variants the earliest forms of typhoeus and typhaon occur prior to the 5th century bc homer uses typhoeus hesiod and the homeric hymn to apollo use both typhoeus and typhaon the later forms typhos and typhon occur from the 5th century bc onwards with typhon becoming the standard form by the end of that century though several possible derivations of the name typhon have been suggested the derivation remains uncertain consistent with hesiod s making storm winds typhon s offspring some have supposed that typhon was originally a wind-god and ancient sources associated him with the greek words tuphon tuphos meaning  whirlwind  other theories include derivation from a greek root meaning  smoke   consistent with typhon s identification with volcanoes  from an  meaning  abyss   making typhon a  serpent of the deep  and from sapn the  name for the  god  s holy mountain   the classical mount kasios  associated with the epithet  comparative mythology
the typhonomachy zeus  battle and defeat of typhon is just one part of a larger  succession myth  given in hesiod s theogony the hesiodic succession myth describes how  the original ruler of the cosmos hid his offspring away inside  but was overthrown by his  son  who castrated uranus and how in turn cronus who swallowed his children as they were born was himself overthrown by his son zeus whose mother had given cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes to swallow in place of zeus however zeus is then confronted with one final adversary typhon which he quickly defeats now clearly the supreme power in the cosmos zeus is elected king of gods zeus then establishes and secures his realm through the apportionment of various functions and responsibilities to the other gods and by means of marriage finally by swallowing his first wife  who was destined to produce a son stronger than himself zeus is able to put an end to the cycle of succession python 
typhon s story seems related to that of another monstrous offspring of gaia   the serpent killed by  at  suggesting a possible common origin besides the similarity of names their shared parentage and the fact that both were snaky monsters killed in single combat with an olympian god there are other connections between the stories surrounding typhon and those surrounding  although the delphic monster killed by  is usually said to be the male serpent python in the homeric hymn to apollo the earliest account of this story the god kills a nameless she-serpent   subsequently called  who had been typhon s foster-mother delphyne and echidna besides both being intimately connected to typhonone as mother the other as mateshare other similarities both were half-maid and half-snake a plague to men and associated with the corycian cave in cilicia python was also perhaps connected with a different  than the one in cilicia this one on the slopes of  above delphi and just as the corcian cave in cilicia was thought to be typhon and echidna s lair and associated with typhon s battle with zeus there is evidence to suggest that the corycian cave above delphi was supposed to be python s  or delphyne s  lair and associated with his  or her  battle with apollo near eastern influence 
from at least as early as pindar and possibly as early as homer and hesiod  with their references to the arimoi and arima  typhon s birth place and battle with zeus were associated with various near east locales in cilicia and syria including the corycian cave mount kasios and the orontes river besides this coincidence of place the hesiodic succession myth  including the typhonomachy  as well as other greek accounts of these myths exhibit other parallels with several  antecedents and it is generally held that the greek accounts are intimately connected with and influenced by these near eastern counterparts in particular the typhonomachy is generally thought to have been influenced by several near eastern monster-slaying myths mesopotamia 
three related god vs monster combat myths from  date from at least the early second-millennium bc or earlier these are the battles of the god ninurta with the monsters asag and anzu and the god marduk s battle with the monstrous tiamat ninurta vs asag 
 a late-third-millennium bc  poem tells the story of the battle between the  hero-god  and the terrible monster  like typhon asag was a monstrous hissing offspring of earth   who grew mighty and challenged the rule of ninurta who like zeus was a storm-god employing winds and floods as weapons as in hesiod s account of the typhonomachy during their battle both asag and ninurta set fire to the landscape and like apollodorus  typhon asag evidently won an initial victory before being finally overcome by ninurta ninurta vs anzu 




 with his thunderbolts battles the winged  palace relief  

the early second millennium bc  epic anzu tells the story of another combat of ninurta with a monstrous challenger his foe is the winged monster  another offspring of earth like hesiod s typhon anzu roared like a lion and was the source of destructive storm winds ninurta destroys anzu on a mountainside and is portrayed as lashing the ground where anzu lay with a rainstorm and floodwaters just as homer has zeus lash the land about typhon with his thundebolts marduk vs tiamat 
the early second-millenium bc  creation epic  tells the story of the battle of the babylonian supreme god  with  the sea personified like zeus marduk was a storm-god who employed wind and lightning as weapons and who before he can succeed to the kingship of the gods must defeat a huge and fearsome enemy in single combat this time the monster is female and may be related to the pythian dragoness  or typhon s mate echidna since like echidna tiamat was the mother of a brood of monsters mount kasios 
like the typhonomachy several near east myths tell of battles between a storm-god and a snaky monster associated with mount kasios the modern  these myths are usually considered to be the origins of the myth of zeuss battle with typhon baal sapon vs yam 
from the south side of the jebel aqra comes the tale of  and  the deified sea  like tiamat above  fragmentary  tablets dated to the fourteenth or thirteenth-century bc tell the story of the  storm-god baal sapons battle against the monstrous yam on mount sapuna the canaanite name for later greeks mount kasios baal defeats yam with two throwing clubs  thunderbolts  named expeller and chaser which fly like eagles from the storm-gods hands other tablets associate the defeat of the snaky yam with the slaying of a seven headed serpent  apparently corresponding to the biblical  tarhunna vs illuyanka 




 battles the serpent     

from the north side of the jebel aqra come  myths c 1250 bc which tell two versions of the storm-god s  tarhuntas  battle against the serpent  in both of these versions tarhunna suffers an initial defeat against illuyanka in one version tarhunna seeks help from the goddess  who lures illuyanka from his lair with a banquet thereby enabling tarhunna to surprise and kill illuyanka in the other version illuyanka steels the heart and eyes of the defeated god but tarhunnas son marries a daughter of illuyanka and is able to retrieve tarhunnas stolen body parts whereupon tarhunna kills illuyanka these stories particularly resemble details found in the accounts of the typhonomachy of apollodorus oppian and nonnus which though late accounts possible preserve much earlier ones  the storm-gods initial defeat  apollodorus nonnus  the loss of vital body parts  sinews  apollodorus nonnus  the help of allies  hermes and aegipan  apollodorus  cadmos and pan  nonnus  pan  oppian  the luring of the serpentine opponent from his lair through the trickery of a banquet  oppian or by music  nonnus  teshub vs hedammu and ullikummi 
another c 1250 bc hittite text derived from the  tells of the hurrian storm-god   with whom the hittite s tarhunna came to be identified  who lived on  the hurrian name for the jebel aqra and his battle with the sea-serpent hedammu again the storm-god is aided by a goddess sauska  equivalent to inaru  who this time seduces the monster with music  as in nonnus  drink and sex successfully luring the serpent from his lair in the sea just as the typhonomachy can be seen as a sequel to the titanomachy a different hittite text derived from the hurrians the song of ullikummi a kind of sequel to the hittite  kingship in heaven  succession myths of which the story of teshub and hedammu formed a part tells of a second monster this time made of stone named ullikummi that teshub must defeat in order to secure his rule set 
from apparently as early as   c 550 bc  c 476 bc  typhon was identified with  the egyptian god of destruction this syncretization with  can also be seen in the story apparently known as early as pindar of typhon chasing the gods to egypt and the gods transforming themselves into animals such a story arose perhaps as a way for the greeks to explain egypt s animal-shaped gods herodotus also identified typhon with set making him the second to last divine king of egypt herodotus says that typhon was deposed by   son  whom herodutus equates with   with osiris being equated with   and after his defeat by horus typhon was  supposed to have been hidden  in the    identified with modern   in egypt confused with the giants
