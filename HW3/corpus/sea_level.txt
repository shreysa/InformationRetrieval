mean sea level  msl   often shortened to sea level  is  level of the surface of one or more of  from which heights such as elevations may be measured msl is a type of  a standardised  reference point that is used for example as a  in  and  or in aviation as the  at which  is measured to  altitude and consequently aircraft  a common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a  at a particular location sea levels can be affected by many factors and are known to have varied greatly over  the careful measurement of variations in msl can offer insights into ongoing  and  has been widely quoted as evidence of ongoing  the term above sea level generally refers to   amsl

measurement 




sea level measurements from 23 long  records in geologically stable environments show a rise of around 200 millimetres  7.9in  during the 20th century  2 mm year  

precise determination of a  mean sea level  is difficult to achieve because of the many factors that affect sea level sea level varies quite a lot on several scales of time and space this is because the sea is in constant motion affected by the tides wind atmospheric pressure local gravitational differences temperature  and so forth the easiest way this may be calculated is by selecting a location and calculating the mean sea level at that point and use it as a  for example a period of 19 years of hourly level observations may be averaged and used to determine the mean sea level at some measurement point to an operator of a  msl means the  still water level the level of the sea with motions such as  averaged outaveraged over a period of time such that changes in sea level e.g due to the  also get averaged out one measures the values of msl in respect to the land hence a change in msl can result from a real change in sea level or from a change in the height of the land on which the tide gauge operates in the uk the   the 0 metres height on uk maps  is the mean sea level measured at  in cornwall between 1915 and 1921 prior to 1921 the datum was msl at the  in hong kong  mpd  is a surveying term meaning  metres above principal datum  and refers to height of 1.230m below the average sea level in france the margraphe in marseilles measures continuously the sea level since 1883 and offers the longest collapsed data about the sea level it is used for a part of continental europe and main part of africa as official sea level elsewhere in europe vertical elevation references  european vertical reference system  are made to the  elevation which dates back to the 1690s satellite altimeters have been making precise measurements of sea level since the launch of  in 1992 a joint mission of  and  topex poseidon was followed by  in 2001 and the  on the jason-2 satellite in 2008  height above mean sea level 
main article  
height above mean sea level  amsl  is the elevation  on the ground  or altitude  in the air  of an object relative to the average sea level datum it is also used in aviation where some heights are recorded and reported with respect to mean sea level  msl   contrast with   and in the  and  an alternative is to base height measurements on an  of the entire earth which is what systems such as  do in aviation the ellipsoid known as  84 is increasingly used to define heights  however differences up to 100 metres  328 feet  exist between this ellipsoid height and mean tidal height the alternative is to use abased vertical  such as  when referring to  features such as mountains on a  variations in elevation are shown by  the elevation of a mountain denotes the highest point or summit and is typically illustrated as a small circle on a topographic map with the amsl height shown in metres feet or both in the rare case that a location is below sea level the elevation amsl is negative for one such case see  difficulties in use

local 







to extend this definition far from the sea means comparing the local height of the mean sea surface with a  level  reference surface or geodetic datum called the geoid in a state of rest or absence of external forces the mean sea level would coincide with this geoid surface being an equipotential surface of the earth s  field in reality due to currents air pressure variations temperature and salinity variations etc this does not occur not even as a long-term average the location-dependent but persistent in time separation between mean sea level and the geoid is referred to as  stationary   it varies globally in a range of 2m historically adjustments were made to sea-level measurements to take into account the effects of the 235 lunar month  and the 223-month  on the tides dry land

several terms are used to describe the changing relationships between sea level and dry land when the term  relative  is used it means change relative to a fixed point in the sediment pile the term  eustatic  refers to global changes in sea level relative to a fixed point such as the centre of the earth for example as a result of melting ice-caps the term  steric  refers to global changes in sea level due to  and  variations the term  isostatic  refers to changes in the level of the land relative to a fixed point in the earth possibly due to thermal buoyancy or  effects  it implies no change in the volume of water in the oceans the melting of  at the end of  is one example of eustatic  the  of land due to the withdrawal of  is an isostatic cause of relative sea level rise  can track sea level by examining the rocks deposited along coasts that are very tectonically stable like the east coast of north america areas like volcanic islands are experiencing relative sea level rise as a result of isostatic cooling of the rock which causes the land to sink on other planets that lack a liquid ocean  can calculate a  mean altitude  by averaging the heights of all points on the surface this altitude sometimes referred to as a  sea level  serves equivalently as a reference for the height of planetary features  change 
not to be confused with    or  local and eustatic 




 between ocean  and 


local mean sea level  lmsl  is defined as the height of the sea with respect to a land benchmark averaged over a period of time  such as a month or a year  long enough that fluctuations caused by  and  are smoothed out one must adjust perceived changes in lmsl to account for vertical movements of the land which can be of the same order  mm yr  as  some land movements occur because of  adjustment of the  to the melting of  at the end of the  the weight of the ice sheet depresses the underlying land and when the ice melts away the  changes in ground-based ice volume also affect local and regional sea levels by the readjustment of the  and    and local ocean temperature changes can affect lmsl as well eustatic change  as opposed to local change  results in an alteration to the global sea levels due to changes in either the volume of water in the world s oceans or net changes in the volume of the  short term and periodic changes 




melting glaciers can cause a change in sea level


there are many factors which can produce short-term  a few minutes to 14 months  changes in sea level two major mechanisms are causing sea level to rise first shrinking land ice such as mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets is releasing water into the oceans second as ocean temperatures rise the warmer water expands 
recent changes 
main article  
further information    and 
for at least the last 100 years sea level has been rising at an average rate of about 1.8mm  0.1in  per year most of this rise can be attributed to the increase in temperature of the sea and the resulting slight  of the upper 500 metres  1,640 feet  of sea water additional contributions as much as one-quarter of the total come from water sources on land such as melting snow and  and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs aviation 
main article  
pilots can estimate height above sea level with an  set to a defined  generally the pressure used to set the altimeter is the barometric pressure that would exist at msl in the region being flown over this pressure is referred to as either  or  altimeter  and is transmitted to the pilot by radio from   atc  or an   atis  since the terrain elevation is also referenced to msl the pilot can estimate height above ground by subtracting the terrain altitude from the altimeter reading  are divided into boxes and the maximum terrain altitude from msl in each box is clearly indicated once above the transition altitude the altimeter is set to the   isa  pressure at msl which is 1013.25 hpa or 29.92 inhg see also
