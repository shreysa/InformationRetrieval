a firestorm is created as a result of the  as the heat of the original fire draws in more and more of the surrounding air this draft can be quickly increased if a low-level  exists over or near the fire as the updraft mushrooms strong inwardly-directed gusty winds develop around the fire supplying it with additional air this would seem to prevent the firestorm from spreading on the wind but the tremendous turbulence created may also cause the strong surface inflow winds to change direction erratically firestorms resulting from the  of  in the second world war were generally confined to the areas initially seeded with incendiary devices and the firestorm did not appreciably spread outward a firestorm may also develop into a  and induce true tornadoes  this occurred with the 2002 durango fire and probably with the much greater  the greater draft of a firestorm draws in greater quantities of  which significantly increases combustion thereby also substantially increasing the production of heat the intense heat of a firestorm manifests largely as radiated heat   radiation  which may ignite flammable material at a distance ahead of the fire itself  this also serves to expand the area and the intensity of the firestorm  violent erratic wind drafts suck movables into the fire and as is observed with all intense conflagrations radiated heat from the fire can melt  some metals and glass and turn street  into flammable hot liquid the very high temperatures ignite anything that might possibly burn until the firestorm runs low on fuel according to experts  a firestorm does not appreciably ignite material at a distance ahead of itself  more accurately the heat desiccates those materials and makes them more vulnerable to ignition by embers or firebrands increasing the rate of fire spotting during the formation of a firestorm many fires merge to form a single convective column of hot gases rising from the burning area and strong fire-induced radial  inwardly directed  winds are associated with the convective column thus the fire front is essentially stationary and the outward spread of fire is prevented by the in-rushing wind a firestorm is characterized by strong to gale-force winds blowing toward the fire everywhere around the fire perimeter an effect which is caused by the  of the rising column of hot gases over the intense mass fire drawing in cool air from the periphery these winds from the perimeter blow the  into the burning area and tend to cool the unignited fuel outside the fire area so that ignition of material outside the periphery by radiated heat and fire embers is more difficult thus limiting fire spread at hiroshima this inrushing to feed the fire is said to have prevented the firestorm perimeter from expanding and thus the firestorm was confined to the area of the city damaged by the blast

large   are distinct from firestorms if they have moving fire fronts which are driven by the ambient wind and do not develop their own wind system like true firestorms  this does not mean that a firestorm must be stationary  as with any other convective storm the circulation may follow surrounding pressure gradients and winds if those lead it onto fresh fuel sources  furthermore non-firestorm conflagrations can develop from a single ignition whereas firestorms have only been observed where large numbers of fires are burning simultaneously over a relatively large area with the important caveat that the density of simultaneously burning fires needs to be above a critical threshold for a firestorm to form  a notable example of large numbers of fires burning simultaneously over a large area without a firestorm developing was the  of 1991 where the distance between individual fires was too large  the high temperatures within the firestorm zone ignite most everything that might possibly burn until a tipping point is reached that is upon running low on fuel which occurs after the firestorm has consumed so much of the available fuel within the firestorm zone that the necessary fuel density required to keep the firestorm s wind system active drops below the threshold level at which time the firestorm breaks up into isolated  in australia the prevalence of  trees that have oil in their leaves results in forest fires that are noted for their extremely tall and intense flame front hence the bush fires appear more as a firestorm than a simple forest fire sometimes emission of combustible gases from swamps  e.g  has a similar effect for instance methane explosions enforced the peshtigo fire weather and climate effects 
firestorms will produce hot buoyant smoke clouds of primarily water vapor that will form  clouds as it enters the cooler upper atmosphere generating what is known as   fire clouds  or if large enough   fire storm  clouds for example the black rain that began to fall at  20 minutes after the  produced in total 510cm of black soot-filled rain in a 13 hour period moreover if the conditions are right a large pyrocumulus can grow into a pyrocumulonimbus and produce  which could potentially set off further fires apart from city and forest fires pyrocumulus clouds can also be produced by  due to the comparable amounts of hot buoyant material formed on a more continental and global extent away from the direct vicinity of the fire wildfire firestorms which produce  events have been found to  surprisingly frequently  generate minor   effects these are analogous to minor  with each mass addition of  additive in increasing the depth of the  winter  cooling from near-imperceptible to   levels city firestorms 
the same underlying combustion physics can also apply to man-made structures such as cities during war or natural disaster firestorms are thought to have been part of the mechanism of large urban fires such as accompanied the  and the  a genuine firestorm was involved in the  firestorms were also created by the  raids of world warii in cities like  and  of the  only hiroshima resulted in a firestorm in contrast experts suggest that due to the nature of modern u.s.city design and construction a firestorm is unlikely after a nuclear detonation 
firebombing 




 burning after aerial firebombing attack in 1944 notice that a firestorm event has yet to develop in this picture as single isolated fires are seen burning and not the single large mass fire that is the identifying characteristic of a firestorm 

 is a technique designed to damage a target generally an urban area through the use of fire caused by  rather than from the blast effect of large bombs such raids often employ both incendiary devices and high explosives the high explosive destroys roofs making it easier for the incendiary devices to penetrate the structures and cause fires the high explosives also disrupt the ability of  to douse the fires although incendiary bombs have been used to destroy buildings since the start of gunpowder warfare world warii saw the first use of  from the air to destroy the ability of the enemy to wage war   and many other british cities were firebombed during  most large german cities were extensively firebombed starting in 1942 and almost all large japanese cities were firebombed during the last six months of world warii as  the officer commanding  from 1942 through to the end of the war in europe pointed out in his post-war analysis although many attempts were made to create deliberate man-made firestorms during world warii few attempts succeeded 

 the germans again and again missed their chanceof setting our cities ablaze by a concentrated attack coventry was adequately concentrated in point of space but all the same there was little concentration in point of time and nothing like the fire tornadoes of hamburg or dresden ever occurred in this country but they did do us enough damage to teach us the principle of concentration the principle of starting so many fires at the same time that no fire fighting services however efficiently and quickly they were reinforced by the fire brigades of other towns could get them under control 
arthur harris 

according to physicist david hafemeister firestorms occurred after about 5 of all fire-bombing raids during world warii  but he does not explain if this is a percentage based on both  and  raids or combined allied raids or u.s.raids alone  in 2005 the american  stated in a report that three major firestorms resulted from allied conventional bombing campaigns during world warii  hamburg dresden and tokyo they do not include the comparatively minor firestorms at kassel darmstadt or even ube into their major firestorm category despite later quoting and corroborating glasstone and dolan and data collected from these smaller firestorms 

based on world war ii experience with mass fires resulting from air raids on germany and japan the minimum requirements for a firestorm to develop are considered by some authorities to be the following   1  at least 8 pounds of combustibles per square foot of fire area  40 kg per square meter   2  at least half of the structures in the area on fire simultaneously  3  a wind of less than 8 miles per hour at the time and  4  a minimum burning area of about half a square mile glasstone and dolan  1977  
21st century cities in comparison to world war ii cities 

unlike the highly combustible world war ii cities that firestormed from conventional and nuclear weapons fire experts suggest that due to the nature of modern u.s.city design and construction a firestorm is unlikely to occur even after a nuclear detonation the explanation for this is that  do not lend themselves to the formation of firestorms due to the  effect of the structures nor are firestorms likely in areas where modern buildings have totally collapsed with the exceptions of tokyo and hiroshima due to the nature of their densely packed  flimsy  wooden buildings in world war ii there is also a sizable difference between the fuel loading of world war ii cities that firestormed and that of modern cities where the quantity of combustibles per square meter in the fire area in the latter is below the necessary requirement for a firestorm to form  40kg m  therefore firestorms are not to be expected in modern u.s or canadian cities following a nuclear detonation nor are they expected to be likely in modern european cities similarly one reason for the lack of success in creating a true firestorm in the  was that the building density or builtupness factor in berlin was too low to support easy fire spread from building to building another reason was that much of the building construction was newer and better than in most of the old german city centers modern building practices in the berlin of world war ii led to more effective firewalls and fire-resistant construction mass firestorms never proved to be possible in berlin no matter how heavy the raid or what kinds of firebombs were dropped no true firestorm ever developed nuclear weapons in comparison to conventional weapons 
the incendiary effects of a  do not present any especially characteristic features in principle the same overall result with respect to destruction of life and property can be achieved by the use of   and  it has been estimated for example that the same fire ferocity and damage produced at hiroshima by one  from a single  could have instead been produced by about 1,200 tons 1.2 kilotons of incendiary bombs from 220 b-29s distributed over the city it may seem counterintuitive that the same amount of fire damage caused by a nuclear weapon could have instead been produced by smaller total yield of thousands of incendiary bombs  however world war ii experience supports this assertion for example although not a perfect clone of the city of hiroshima in 1945 in the conventional  the combined   raf  and   usaaf  dropped a total of 3441.3 tons  approximately 3.4   of   about half of which was incendiary bombs  on the night of 1314 february 1945 and this resulted in  more than  2.5 square miles  6.5km2  of the city being destroyed by fire and firestorm effects according to one authoritative source or approximately 8 square miles  21km2  by another in total about 4.5 kilotons of conventional ordnance was dropped on the city over a number of months during 1945 and this resulted in approximately 15 square miles  39km2  of the city being destroyed by blast and fire effects during the  on 910 march 1945 279 of the 334 b-29s dropped 1,665 tons of incendiary and high-explosive bombs on the city resulting in the destruction of over 10,000 acres of buildings  16 square miles  41km2  a quarter of the city in contrast to these raids when a single 16-kiloton nuclear bomb was dropped on hiroshima 4.5 square miles  12km2  of the city was destroyed by blast fire and firestorm effects similarly major cortez f enloe a surgeon in the usaaf who worked with the   ussbs  said that the  dropped on nagasaki did not do as much fire damage as the extended  






hiroshima after the bombing and firestorm no known aerial photography of the firestorm exists 








note the ambient wind blowing the fire s smoke plume inland the firebombing of tokyo on the night of 910 march 1945 was the single deadliest air raid of world war ii with a greater total area of fire damage and loss of life than either nuclear bombing as a single event due largely to the greater population density and fire conditions 279 b-29s dropped about 1,700 tons of ordnance on target 








hiroshima aftermath despite a true firestorm developing reinforced concrete buildings as in tokyo similarly remained standing signed by the  pilot  








this tokyo residential section was virtually destroyed all that remained standing were concrete buildings in this photograph 




american historian  also echoed this sentiment 

during november 1944 american b-29 s began their first  on tokyo and on 9 march 1945 wave upon wave dropped masses of small incendiaries containing an early version of  on the city s population....soon small fires spread connected grew into a vast firestorm that sucked the oxygen out of the lower atmosphere the bomb raid was a  success  for the americans  they killed 125,000 japanese in one attack the  bombed hamburg and dresden in the same manner and    and tokyo again on may 24....in fact the atomic bomb used against hiroshima was less lethal than massive fire bombing....only its technique was novelnothing more....there was another difficulty posed by mass conventional bombing and that was its very success a success that made the two modes of human destruction qualitatively identical in fact and in the minds of the   i was a little fearful    told    that before we could get ready the air force might have japan so thoroughly bombed out that the new weapon would not have a fair background to show its strength  to this the president  laughed and said he understood 

this break from the linear expectation of more fire damage to occur after greater explosive yield is dropped can be easily explained by two major factors first the order of blast and thermal events during a nuclear explosion is not ideal for the creation of fires in an incendiary bombing raid incendiary weapons followed after high-explosive blast weapons were dropped in a manner designed to create the greatest probability of fires from a  and incendiary weapons the so-called two-ton   also known as  blockbusters  were dropped first and were intended to rupture water mains as well as to blow off roofs doors and windows creating an air flow that would feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that would then follow and be dropped ideally into holes created by the prior blast weapons such into attic and roof spaces on the other hand nuclear weapons produce effects that are in the reverse order with thermal effects and  flash  occurring first which are then followed by the slower blast wave it is for this reason that conventional incendiary bombing raids are considered to be a great deal more efficient at causing mass fires than nuclear weapons of comparable yield it is likely this led the nuclear weapon effects experts   and  to state that the same fire damage suffered at hiroshima could have instead been produced by about 1 kiloton 1,000 tons of incendiary bombs the second factor explaining the non-intuitive break in the expected results of greater explosive yield producing greater city fire damage is that city fire damage is largely dependent not on the yield of the weapons used but on the conditions in and around the city itself with the fuel loading per square meter value of the city being one of the major factors a few hundred strategically placed incendiary devices would be sufficient to start a firestorm in a city if the conditions for a firestorm namely high fuel loading are already inherent to the city  see   the  in 1666 although not forming a firestorm due to the single point of ignition serves as an example that given a densely packed and predominately wooden and  building construction in the urban area a mass fire is conceivable from the mere incendiary power of no more than a domestic fireplace on the other hand the largest nuclear weapon conceivable will be incapable of igniting a city into a firestorm if the city s properties namely its fuel density are not conducive to one developing despite the disadvantage of nuclear weapons when compared to conventional weapons of lower or comparable yield in terms of effectiveness at starting fires for the reasons discussed above nuclear weapons also do not add any fuel to a city and fires are entirely dependent on what was contained in the city prior to bombing in direct contrast to the incendiary device effect of conventional raids one undeniable advantage of nuclear weapons over conventional weapons when it comes to creating fires is that nuclear weapons undoubtedly produce all their thermal and explosive effects in a very short period of time  that is to use  s terminology they are the epitome of an air raid guaranteed to be concentrated in  point in time  in contrast early in world war ii the ability to achieve conventional air raids concentrated in  point of time  depended largely upon the skill of pilots to remain in formation and their ability to hit the target whilst at times also being under heavy fire from  from the air defensives of the cities below nuclear weapons largely remove these uncertain variables therefore nuclear weapons reduce the question of whether a city will firestorm or not to a smaller number of variables to the point of becoming entirely reliant on the intrinsic properties of the city such as fuel loading and predictable atmospheric conditions such as wind speed in and around the city and less reliant on the unpredictable possibility of hundreds of bomber crews acting together successfully as a single unit see also
