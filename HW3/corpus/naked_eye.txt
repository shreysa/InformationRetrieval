the naked eye


naked eye also called bare eye or unaided eye is the practice of engaging in  unaided by a  or   such as a  or  vision corrected to normal  using  is considered  naked  in  the naked eye may be used to observe events that can be viewed without equipment such as an  the passage of a  or a  sometimes some asteroids can be seen including  sky lore and various tests demonstrate an impressive wealth of phenomena that can be seen with the unaided eye

naked eye in astronomy 




a photographic approximation of a naked eye view of the  from a small rural town  top  and a   bottom   dramatically reduces the visibility of  

the visibility of astronomical objects is strongly affected by  even a few hundred kilometers away from a metropolitan area where the sky can appear to be very dark it is still the residual light pollution that sets the limit on the visibility of faint objects for most people these are likely to be the best observing conditions within their reach under such  typical  dark sky conditions the naked eye can see stars with an  up to  6m under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent stars as faint as  8m might be visible the angular resolution of the naked eye is about 1  however some people have sharper vision than that there is anecdotal evidence that people had  the galilean  before telescopes were invented of similar magnitude  and  had most probably been seen but could not be recognized as planets because they appear so faint even at maximum brightness that their motion could not be detected uranus when discovered in 1781 was the first planet discovered using   a   rather than being spotted by the naked eye theoretically in a typical dark sky the  human eye would see the about 5,600 stars brighter than  6m while in perfect dark sky conditions about 45,000 stars brighter than  8m might be visible in practice the atmospheric  and dust reduces this number somewhat in the center of a city where the naked-eye limiting magnitude due to extreme amounts of light pollution can be  4m or less as few as 200 to 500 stars may be visible colors can be seen but this is limited by the fact that the eye uses  to view fainter stars the visibility of diffuse objects such as  and galaxies is much more strongly affected by light pollution than is that of planets and stars under typical dark conditions only a few such objects are visible these include the   the  the  the    the ptolemy cluster  near the tail of  and the  in  the  is a difficult  object and only visible at all if it is higher than 50 in the sky the globular clusters  in  and  in hercules are also visible with the naked eye under such conditions under really dark sky conditions however m33 is easy to see even in direct vision many other  are also visible under such conditions the most distant objects that have been seen by the naked eye are nearby bright galaxies such as    and   can be recognized as planets from  with the naked eye  mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn under typical dark sky conditions   magnitude  5.8  can be seen as well with averted vision the sun and the moonthe remaining noticeable naked-eye objects of the solar systemare sometimes added to make seven  planets  during daylight only the  and  are obvious naked eye objects but in many cases  can be spotted in daylight and in rarer cases  close to sunset and sunrise bright stars like  or even  can be spotted with the naked eye as long as one knows the exact position in which to look historically the zenith of naked-eye astronomy was the work of   15461601  he built an extensive observatory to make precise measurements of the heavens without any instruments for magnification in 1610  pointed a  towards the sky he immediately discovered the  and the  of  among other things meteor showers are better observed by naked eye than with binoculars such showers include the   1012 august  and the december  some 100  per night the  and the  are other popular objects visible to the naked eye space geodesy and navigation 
many other things can be estimated without an instrument if an arm is stretched the span of the hand corresponds to an angle of 18 to 20 the distance of a person just covered up by the outstretched thumbnail is about 100 meters the vertical can be estimated to about 2 and in the northern hemisphere observing the  and using a protractor can give the observer s geographic  up to 1 degree of accuracy the     and  measured all the basics of their respective time and calendar systems by naked eye

observing a nearby small object without a  or a  the size of the object depends on the viewing distance under normal lighting conditions  light source   1000 lumens at height 600700mm viewing angle   35 degrees  the angular size recognized by naked eye will be round 1 arc minute   1 60 degrees   0.0003 radians at a viewing distance of 16      400mm which is considered a normal reading distance in the usa the smallest object resolution will be   0.116mm for inspection purposes laboratories use a viewing distance of 200250mm  which gives the smallest size of the object recognizable to the naked eye of  0.058 0.072mm 55-75 micrometers  the  of a measurement ranges from 0.1 to 0.3mm and depends on the experience of the observer the latter figure is the usual positional accuracy of faint details in maps and technical plans environmental pollution
