overview 
the space shuttle was a partially reusable  vehicle capable of reaching  commissioned and operated by the us   nasa  from 1981 to 2011 it resulted from shuttle design studies conducted by nasa and the us air force in the 1960s and was first proposed for development as part of an ambitious second-generation   sts  of space vehicles to follow the  in a september 1969 report of a space task group headed by vice president  to president  nixon s post-apollo nasa budgeting withdrew support of all system components except the shuttle to which nasa applied the sts name the vehicle consisted of a  for orbit and re-entry fueled by expendable liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks with reusable strap-on solid booster rockets the  of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 all launched from the  florida the system was retired from service in 2011 after 135 missions with atlantis making the final launch of the three-decade shuttle program on july 8 2011 the program ended after atlantis landed at the kennedy space center on july 21 2011 major missions included launching numerous satellites and interplanetary probes conducting space science experiments and servicing and construction of space stations the first  vehicle named  was built for the initial  phase and lacked engines heat shielding and other equipment necessary for orbital flight a total of five operational orbiters were built and of these two were destroyed in accidents it was used for orbital space missions by nasa the  the  japan and germany the united states funded shuttle development and operations except for the spacelab modules used on  and sponsored by germany  was partially funded by japan

the formal design of what became the space shuttle began with the  phase a  contract design studies issued in the late 1960s conceptualization  before the  of the 1960s one of the places the concept of a spacecraft returning from space to a horizontal landing originated was within  in 1954 in the form of an  research experiment later named the  the naca proposal was submitted by  in 1958 the x-15 concept further developed into proposal to launch an x-15 into space and another   proposal named  as well as variety of aerospace plane concepts and studies  was selected to pilot both the x-15 and the x-20 though the x-20 was not built another spaceplane similar to the x-20 was built several years later and delivered to nasa in january 1966 called the   hl  indicated  horizontal landing  in the mid-1960s the  conducted classified  on next-generation space transportation systems and concluded that semi-reusable designs were the cheapest choice it proposed a development program with an immediate start on a  classi  vehicle with expendable boosters followed by slower development of a  classii  semi-reusable design and possible  classiii  fully reusable design later in 1967  held a one-day symposium at nasa headquarters to study the options eighty people attended and presented a wide variety of designs including earlier us air force designs such as the x-20 dyna-soar in 1968 nasa officially began work on what was then known as the integrated launch and re-entry vehicle  ilrv  at the same time nasa held a separate space shuttle main engine  ssme  competition nasa offices in  and  jointly issued a   rfp  for ilrv studies to design a spacecraft that could deliver a payload to orbit but also re-enter the atmosphere and fly back to earth for example one of the responses was for a two-stage design featuring a large booster and a small orbiter called the  one of several phase a shuttle designs after the aforementioned  phase a  studies b c and d phases progressively evaluated in-depth designs up to 1972 in the final design the bottom stage consisted of recoverable solid rocket boosters and the top stage used an expendable external tank in 1969 president  decided to  with space shuttle development a series of development programs and analysis refined the basic design prior to full development and testing in august 1973 the  proved that an unpowered spaceplane could re-enter earth s atmosphere for a horizontal landing across the atlantic european ministers met in belgium in 1973 to authorize western europe s manned orbital project and its main contribution to space shuttlethe  program spacelab would provide a multidisciplinary orbital space laboratory and additional space equipment for the shuttle description 




sts-1 on the launch pad december 1980


the space shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for  it carried different payloads to low earth orbit provided crew rotation and supplies for the   iss  and performed satellite servicing and repair the orbiter could also recover satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to earth each shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life although this was later extended the person in charge of designing the sts was  who had also overseen the   and  spacecraft designs the crucial factor in the size and shape of the shuttle orbiter was the requirement that it be able to accommodate the largest planned commercial and military satellites and have over 1,000 mile cross-range recovery range to meet the requirement for classified usaf missions for a once-around abort from a launch to a  the militarily specified 1,085nmi  2,009km  1,249mi  cross range requirement was one of the primary reasons for the shuttle s large wings compared to modern commercial designs with very minimal control surfaces and glide capability factors involved in opting for solid rockets and an expendable fuel tank included the desire of the pentagon to obtain a high-capacity payload vehicle for satellite deployment and the desire of the nixon administration to reduce the costs of  by developing a spacecraft with reusable components each space shuttle was a  composed of three main assemblies  the reusable ov the expendable et and the two reusable srbs only the ov entered orbit shortly after the tank and boosters are jettisoned the vehicle was launched vertically like a conventional rocket and the orbiter glided to a horizontal landing like an airplane after which it was refurbished for reuse the srbs parachuted to splashdown in the ocean where they were towed back to shore and refurbished for later shuttle missions

the main function of the space shuttle external tank was to supply the liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel to the main engines it was also the backbone of the launch vehicle providing attachment points for the two solid rocket boosters and the orbiter the external tank was the only part of the shuttle system that was not reused although the external tanks were always discarded it would have been possible to take them into orbit and re-use them  such as a  for incorporation into a space station  solid rocket boosters 
main article  
two solid rocket boosters  srbs  each provided 12,500kn  2,800,000lbf  of thrust at liftoff which was 83 of the total thrust at liftoff the srbs were jettisoned two minutes after launch at a height of about 46km  150,000ft  and then deployed parachutes and landed in the ocean to be recovered the srb cases were made of steel about inch  13mm  thick the solid rocket boosters were re-used many times  the casing used in  engine testing in 2009 consisted of motor cases that had been flown collectively on 48 shuttle missions including sts-1 astronauts who have flown on multiple spacecraft report that shuttle delivers a rougher ride than apollo or soyuz the additional vibration is caused by the solid rocket boosters as solid fuel does not burn as evenly as liquid fuel the vibration dampens down after the solid rocket boosters have been jettisoned

a major component of the space shuttle program was spacelab primarily contributed by a consortium of european countries and operated in conjunction with the united states and international partners supported by a modular system of pressurized modules pallets and systems spacelab missions executed on multidisciplinary science orbital logistics and international cooperation over 29 missions flew on subjects ranging from astronomy microgravity radar and life sciences to name a few spacelab hardware also supported missions such as hubble  hst  servicing and space station resupply sts-2 and sts-3 provided testing and the first full mission was spacelab-1   launched on november 28 1983 spacelab formally began in 1973 after a meeting in brussels belgium by european heads of state within the decade spacelab went into orbit and provided europe and the united states with an orbital workshop and hardware system international cooperation science and exploration were realized on spacelab flight systems 
the shuttle was one of the earliest craft to use a computerized  digital  this means no mechanical or hydraulic linkages connected the pilot s control stick to the control surfaces or reaction control system thrusters the control algorithm which used a classical   pid  approach was developed and maintained by   the shuttle s  digital  was composed of 4 control systems each addressing a different mission phase  ascent descent on-orbit and aborts  honeywell is also credited with the design and implementation of the shuttle s nose wheel steering control algorithm that allowed the orbiter to safely land at kennedy space center s shuttle runway 
a concern with using digital fly-by-wire systems on the shuttle was reliability considerable research went into the shuttle computer system the shuttle used five identical redundant ibm 32-bit general purpose computers  gpcs  model  constituting a type of  four computers ran specialized software called the primary avionics software system  pass  a fifth backup computer ran separate software called the backup flight system  bfs  collectively they were called the data processing system  dps

the design goal of the shuttle s dps was fail-operational fail-safe reliability after a single failure the shuttle could still continue the mission after two failures it could still land safely the four general-purpose computers operated essentially in lockstep checking each other if one computer provided a different result than the other three  i.e the one computer failed  the three functioning computers  voted  it out of the system this isolated it from vehicle control if a second computer of the three remaining failed the two functioning computers voted it out a very unlikely failure mode would have been where two of the computers produced result a and two produced result b  a two-two split  in this unlikely case one group of two was to be picked at random the backup flight system  bfs  was separately developed software running on the fifth computer used only if the entire four-computer primary system failed the bfs was created because although the four primary computers were hardware redundant they all ran the same software so a generic software problem could crash all of them embedded system  software was developed under totally different conditions from public commercial software  the number of code lines was tiny compared to a public commercial software product changes were only made infrequently and with extensive testing and many programming and test personnel worked on the small amount of computer code however in theory it could have still failed and the bfs existed for that contingency while the bfs could run in parallel with pass the bfs never engaged to take over control from pass during any shuttle mission the software for the shuttle computers was written in a high-level language called  somewhat similar to  it is specifically designed for a  embedded system environment the ibm ap-101 computers originally had about 424 kilobytes of  each the cpu could process about 400,000 instructions per second they had no hard disk drive and loaded software from magnetic tape cartridges in 1990 the original computers were replaced with an upgraded model ap-101s which had about 2.5 times the memory capacity  about 1 megabyte  and three times the processor speed  about 1.2million instructions per second  the memory was changed from magnetic core to semiconductor with battery backup early shuttle missions starting in november 1983 took along the  arguably one of the first laptop computers the grid was given the name spoc for shuttle portable onboard computer use on the shuttle required both hardware and software modifications which were incorporated into later versions of the commercial product it was used to monitor and display the shuttle s ground position path of the next two orbits show where the shuttle had line of sight communications with ground stations and determine points for location-specific observations of the earth the compass sold poorly as it cost at least us 8000 but it offered unmatched performance for its weight and size nasa was one of its main customers during its service life the shuttle s control system never experienced a failure many of the lessons learned have been used to design today s high speed control algorithms orbiter markings and insignia

the prototype orbiter enterprise originally had a  on the upper surface of the left wing and the letters  usa  in black on the right wing the name  enterprise  was painted in black on the payload bay doors just above the hinge and behind the crew module  on the aft end of the payload bay doors was the  in gray underneath the rear of the payload bay doors on the side of the fuselage just above the wing is the text  united states  in black with a flag of the united states ahead of it the first operational orbiter columbia originally had the same markings as enterprise although the letters  usa  on the right wing were slightly larger and spaced farther apart columbia also had black markings which enterprise lacked on its forward rcs module around the cockpit windows and on its vertical stabilizer and had distinctive black  chines  on the forward part of its upper wing surfaces which none of the other orbiters had challenger established a modified marking scheme for the shuttle fleet that was matched by discovery atlantis and endeavour the letters  usa  in black above an american flag were displayed on the left wing with the nasa  worm  logotype in gray centered above the name of the orbiter in black on the right wing the name of the orbiter was inscribed not on the payload bay doors but on the forward fuselage just below and behind the cockpit windows this would make the name visible when the shuttle was photographed in orbit with the doors open in 1983 enterprise had its wing markings changed to match challenger and the nasa  worm  logotype on the aft end of the payload bay doors was changed from gray to black some black markings were added to the nose cockpit windows and vertical tail to more closely resemble the flight vehicles but the name  enterprise  remained on the payload bay doors as there was never any need to open them columbia had its name moved to the forward fuselage to match the other flight vehicles after  during the 198688 hiatus when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the  but retained its original wing markings until its last overhaul  after   and its unique black wing  chines  for the remainder of its operational life beginning in 1998 the flight vehicles  markings were modified to incorporate the nasa  the  worm  logotype which the agency had phased out was removed from the payload bay doors and the  meatball  insignia was added aft of the  united states  text on the lower aft fuselage the  meatball  insignia was also displayed on the left wing with the american flag above the orbiter s name left-justified rather than centered on the right wing the three surviving flight vehicles discovery atlantis and endeavour still bear these markings as museum displays enterprise became the property of the  in 1985 and was no longer under nasa s control when these changes were made hence the prototype orbiter still has its 1983 markings and still has its name on the payload bay doors upgrades 




 was the first shuttle to fly with a  on   composite image 


the space shuttle was initially developed in the 1970s but received many upgrades and modifications afterward to improve performance reliability and safety internally the shuttle remained largely similar to the original design with the exception of the improved avionics computers in addition to the computer upgrades the original analog primary flight instruments were replaced with modern full-color flat-panel display screens called a  which is similar to those of contemporary airliners to facilitate construction of iss the internal airlocks of each orbiter except columbia were replaced with external docking systems to allow for a greater amount of cargo to be stored on the shuttle s mid-deck during station resupply missions the space shuttle main engines  ssmes  had several improvements to enhance reliability and power this explains phrases such as  main engines throttling up to 104 percent  this did not mean the engines were being run over a safe limit the 100 percent figure was the original specified power level during the lengthy development program  determined the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104 percent of the originally specified thrust nasa could have rescaled the output number saying in essence 104 percent is now 100 percent to clarify this would have required revising much previous documentation and software so the 104 percent number was retained ssme upgrades were denoted as  block numbers  such as block i block ii and block iia the upgrades improved engine reliability maintainability and performance the 109 thrust level was finally reached in flight hardware with the block ii engines in 2001 the normal maximum throttle was 104 percent with 106 percent or 109 percent used for mission aborts for the first two missions sts-1 and  the external tank was painted white to protect the insulation that covers much of the tank but improvements and testing showed that it was not required the weight saved by not painting the tank resulted in an increase in payload capability to orbit additional weight was saved by removing some of the internal  stringers  in the hydrogen tank that proved unnecessary the resulting  light-weight external tank  was first flown on sts-6  and used on the majority of shuttle missions  saw the first flight of the  super light-weight external tank  this version of the tank was made of the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy it weighed 3.4 metric tons  7,500lb  less than the last run of lightweight tanks allowing the shuttle to deliver heavy elements to iss s high inclination orbit as the shuttle was always operated with a crew each of these improvements was first flown on operational mission flights the solid rocket boosters underwent improvements as well design engineers added a third  seal to the joints between the segments after the 1986 space shuttle challenger disaster 



the three nozzles of the  with the two   oms  pods and the  above 

several other srb improvements were planned to improve performance and safety but never came to be these culminated in the considerably simpler lower cost probably safer and better-performing  these rockets entered production in the early to mid-1990s to support the space station but were later canceled to save money after the expenditure of  2.2billion the loss of the asrb program resulted in the development of the super lightweight external tank  slwt  which provided some of the increased payload capability while not providing any of the safety improvements in addition the us air force developed their own much lighter single-piece srb design using a filament-wound system but this too was canceled  was delayed in 1995 when  bored holes in the foam insulation of discovery s external tank since then nasa has installed commercial plastic owl decoys and inflatable owl balloons which had to be removed prior to launch the delicate nature of the foam insulation had been the cause of damage to the  the tile heat shield and heat wrap of the orbiter nasa remained confident that this damage while it was the primary cause of the space shuttle columbia disaster on february 1 2003 would not jeopardize the completion of the international space station  iss  in the projected time allotted a cargo-only unmanned variant of the shuttle was variously proposed and rejected since the 1980s it was called the  and would have traded re-usability for cargo capability with large potential savings from reusing technology developed for the space shuttle another proposal was to convert the payload bay into a passenger area with versions ranging from 30 to 74 seats three days in orbit and cost us 1.5million per seat on the first four shuttle missions astronauts wore modified us air force high-altitude full-pressure suits which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent from the fifth flight  until the loss of challenger one-piece light blue  flight suits and partial-pressure helmets were worn a less-bulky partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet was reinstated when shuttle flights resumed in 1988 the launch-entry suit ended its service life in late 1995 and was replaced by the full-pressure   aces  which resembled the  in design but retained the orange color of the launch-entry suit to extend the duration that orbiters could stay docked at the iss the   sspts  was installed the sspts allowed these orbiters to use power provided by the iss to preserve their consumables the sspts was first used successfully on  specifications

all space shuttle missions were launched from kennedy space center  ksc  the  included but were not limited to  precipitation temperatures cloud cover lightning forecast wind and humidity the shuttle was not launched under conditions where it could have been struck by  aircraft are often struck by lightning with no adverse effects because the electricity of the strike is dissipated through its conductive structure and the aircraft is not electrically  like most jet airliners the shuttle was mainly constructed of conductive aluminum which would normally shield and protect the internal systems however upon liftoff the shuttle sent out a long exhaust plume as it ascended and this plume could have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground the nasa anvil rule for a shuttle launch stated that an  could not appear within a distance of 10  the shuttle launch weather officer monitored conditions until the final decision to scrub a launch was announced in addition the weather conditions had to be acceptable at one of the transatlantic abort landing sites  one of several   to launch as well as the solid rocket booster recovery area while the shuttle might have safely endured a lightning strike a  so for safety  chose not to launch the shuttle if lightning was possible  npr8715.5  historically the shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from december to january  a year-end rollover or yero  its flight software designed in the 1970s was not designed for this and would require the orbiter s computers be reset through a change of year which could cause a glitch while in orbit in 2007 nasa engineers devised a solution so shuttle flights could cross the year-end boundary launch 
after the final hold in the countdown at t-minus 9 minutes the shuttle went through its final preparations for launch and the countdown was automatically controlled by the ground launch sequencer  gls  software at the launch control center which stopped the count if it sensed a critical problem with any of the shuttle s onboard systems the gls handed off the count to the shuttle s on-board computers at t minus 31 seconds in a process called auto sequence start at t-minus 16 seconds the massive sound suppression system  sps  began to drench the   mlp  and srb trenches with 300,000 us gallons  1,100m3  of water to protect the orbiter from damage by  energy and rocket exhaust reflected from the flame trench and mlp during lift off at t-minus 10 seconds hydrogen igniters were activated under each engine bell to quell the stagnant gas inside the cones before ignition failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase the main engine turbopumps also began charging the combustion chambers with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at this time the computers reciprocated this action by allowing the redundant computer systems to begin the firing phase 



space shuttle main engine ignition


the three main engines  ssmes  started at t-6.6 seconds the main engines ignited sequentially via the shuttle s general purpose computers  gpcs  at 120 millisecond intervals all three ssmes were required to reach 90 rated thrust within three seconds otherwise the onboard computers would initiate an  if all three engines indicated nominal performance by t-3 seconds they were commanded to gimbal to liftoff configuration and the command would be issued to arm the srbs for ignition at t-0 between t-6.6 seconds and t-3 seconds while the ssmes were firing but the srbs were still bolted to the pad the offset thrust caused the entire launch stack  boosters tank and orbiter  to pitch down 650mm  25.5in  measured at the tip of the external tank the three second delay after confirmation of ssme operation was to allow the stack to return to nearly vertical at t-0 seconds the 8  holding the srbs to the pad were detonated the ssmes were commanded to 100 throttle and the srbs were ignited by t 0.23 seconds the srbs built up enough thrust for liftoff to commence and reached maximum chamber pressure by t 0.6 seconds the  s  assumed control of the flight once the srbs had cleared the launch tower shortly after liftoff the shuttle s main engines were throttled up to 104.5 and the vehicle began a combined roll pitch and yaw maneuver that placed it onto the correct heading  azimuth  for the planned orbital inclination and in a heads down attitude with wings level the shuttle flew upside down during the ascent phase this orientation allowed a trim angle of attack that was favorable for aerodynamic loads during the region of high dynamic pressure resulting in a net positive load factor as well as providing the flight crew with a view of the horizon as a visual reference the vehicle climbed in a progressively flattening arc accelerating as the mass of the srbs and main tank decreased to achieve low orbit requires much more horizontal than vertical acceleration this was not visually obvious since the vehicle rose vertically and was out of sight for most of the horizontal acceleration the near circular orbital velocity at the 380 kilometers  236mi  altitude of the international space station is 27,650km h  17,180mph  roughly equivalent to mach 23 at sea level as the international space station orbits at an inclination of 51.6 degrees missions going there must set orbital inclination to the same value in order to rendezvous with the station around 30 seconds into ascent the ssmes were throttled downusually to 72 though this variedto reduce the maximum aerodynamic forces acting on the shuttle at a point called  additionally the propellant grain design of the srbs caused their thrust to drop by about 30 by 50 seconds into ascent once the orbiter s guidance verified that max q would be within shuttle structural limits the main engines were throttled back up to 104.5  this throttling down and back up was called the  thrust bucket  to maximize performance the throttle level and timing of the thrust bucket was shaped to bring the shuttle as close to aerodynamic limits as possible

at around t 126 seconds  released the srbs and small separation rockets pushed them laterally away from the vehicle the srbs parachuted back to the ocean to be reused the shuttle then began accelerating to orbit on the main engines acceleration at this point would typically fall to9  and the vehicle would take on a somewhat nose-up angle to the horizon it used the main engines to gain and then maintain altitude while it accelerated horizontally towards orbit at about five and three-quarter minutes into ascent the orbiter s direct communication links with the ground began to fade at which point it rolled heads up to reroute its communication links to the  system at about seven and a half minutes into ascent the mass of the vehicle was low enough that the engines had to be throttled back to limit vehicle acceleration to 3 g  29.4m s or 96.5ft s equivalent to accelerating from zero to 105.9km h  65.8mph  in a second  the shuttle would maintain this acceleration for the next minute and main engine cut-off  meco  occurred at about eight and a half minutes after launch the main engines were shut down before complete depletion of propellant as running dry would have destroyed the engines the oxygen supply was terminated before the hydrogen supply as the ssmes reacted unfavorably to other shutdown modes  liquid oxygen has a tendency to react violently and supports combustion when it encounters hot engine metal  a few seconds after meco the external tank was released by firing pyrotechnic fasteners at this point the shuttle and external tank were on a slightly suborbital trajectory coasting up towards  once at apogee about half an hour after meco the shuttle s   oms  engines were fired to raise its  and achieve orbit while the external tank fell back into the atmosphere and burned up over the indian ocean or the pacific ocean depending on launch profile the sealing action of the tank plumbing and lack of pressure relief systems on the external tank helped it break up in the lower atmosphere after the foam burned away during re-entry the heat caused a pressure buildup in the remaining liquid oxygen and hydrogen until the tank exploded this ensured that any pieces that fell back to earth were small

the shuttle was monitored throughout its ascent for short range tracking  10 seconds before liftoff through 57 seconds after  medium range  7 seconds before liftoff through 110 seconds after  and long range  7 seconds before liftoff through 165 seconds after  short range cameras included 22 16mm cameras on the mobile launch platform and 8 16mm on the fixed service structure 4 high speed fixed cameras located on the perimeter of the launch complex plus an additional 42 fixed cameras with 16mm motion picture film medium range cameras included remotely operated tracking cameras at the launch complex plus 6 sites along the immediate coast north and south of the launch pad each with 800mm lens and high speed cameras running 100 frames per second these cameras ran for only 410 seconds due to limitations in the amount of film available long range cameras included those mounted on the external tank srbs and orbiter itself which streamed live video back to the ground providing valuable information about any debris falling during ascent long range tracking cameras with 400-inch film and 200-inch video lenses were operated by a photographer at  as well as 9 other sites from 38 miles north at the  to 23 miles south to   pafb  and additional mobile optical tracking camera was stationed on merritt island during launches a total of 10 hd cameras were used both for ascent information for engineers and broadcast feeds to networks such as  and  the number of cameras significantly increased and numerous existing cameras were upgraded at the recommendation of the  to provide better information about the debris during launch debris was also tracked using a pair of  continuous pulse doppler x-band radars one on board the srb recovery ship  positioned north east of the launch pad and on a ship positioned south of the launch pad additionally during the first 2 flights following the loss of columbia and her crew a pair of nasa  reconnaissance aircraft equipped with hd video and infrared flew at 60,000 feet  18,000m  to provide additional views of the launch ascent kennedy space center also invested nearly  3million in improvements to the digital video analysis systems in support of debris tracking in orbit 
once in orbit the shuttle usually flew at an altitude of 320km  170nmi  and occasionally as high as 650km  350nmi  in the 1980s and 1990s many flights involved space science missions on the nasa esa spacelab or launching various types of satellites and science probes by the 1990s and 2000s the focus shifted more to servicing the space station with fewer satellite launches most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks although longer missions were possible with the  add-on or when attached to a space station 
re-entry and landing 

almost the entire space shuttle re-entry procedure except for lowering the landing gear and deploying the air data probes was normally performed under computer control however the re-entry could be flown entirely manually if an emergency arose the approach and landing phase could be controlled by the autopilot but was usually hand flown

the vehicle began re-entry by firing the orbital maneuvering system engines while flying upside down backside first in the opposite direction to orbital motion for approximately three minutes which reduced the shuttle s velocity by about 200mph  322km h  the resultant slowing of the shuttle lowered its orbital  down into the upper atmosphere the shuttle then flipped over by pushing its nose down  which was actually  up  relative to the earth because it was flying upside down  this oms firing was done roughly halfway around the globe from the landing site the vehicle started encountering more significant air density in the lower thermosphere at about 400,000ft  120km  at around  25 8,200m s  30,000km h  18,000mph  the vehicle was controlled by a combination of  and control surfaces to fly at a 40-degree nose-up attitude producing high drag not only to slow it down to landing speed but also to reduce reentry heating as the vehicle encountered progressively denser air it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft in a straight line its 40-degree nose-up attitude would cause the descent angle to flatten-out or even rise the vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep s-shaped banking turns each lasting several minutes at up to 70 degrees of bank while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack in this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards this occurred during the  hottest  phase of re-entry when the heat-shield glowed red and the g-forces were at their highest by the end of the last turn the transition to aircraft was almost complete the vehicle leveled its wings lowered its nose into a shallow dive and began its approach to the landing site

the orbiter s maximum   varies considerably with speed ranging from 1 1 at  speeds 2 1 at supersonic speeds and reaching 4.5 1 at subsonic speeds during approach and landing in the lower atmosphere the orbiter flies much like a conventional glider except for a much higher descent rate over 50m s  180km h  110mph  or 9,800 fpm at approximately mach 3 two air data probes located on the left and right sides of the orbiter s forward lower fuselage are deployed to sense air pressure related to the vehicle s movement in the atmosphere 
final approach and landing phase






 space shuttle endeavour landing video 2009


when the approach and landing phase began the orbiter was at a 3,000m  9,800ft  altitude 12km  7.5mi  from the runway the pilots applied aerodynamic braking to help slow down the vehicle the orbiter s speed was reduced from 682 to 346km h  424 to 215mph  approximately at touch-down  compared to 260km h or 160mph for a jet airliner  the landing gear was deployed while the orbiter was flying at 430km h  270mph  to assist the speed brakes a 12m  39ft  drag chute was deployed either after main gear or nose gear touchdown  depending on selected chute deploy mode  at about 343km h  213mph  the chute was jettisoned once the orbiter slowed to 110km h  68.4mph

nasa preferred space shuttle landings to be at  if weather conditions made landing there unfavorable the shuttle could delay its landing until conditions are favorable touch down at edwards air force base california or use one of the multiple alternate landing sites around the world a landing at any site other than kennedy space center meant that after touchdown the shuttle must be mated to the shuttle carrier aircraft and returned to  space shuttle columbia   once landed at the    this was viewed as a last resort as nasa scientists believed that the sand could potentially damage the shuttle s exterior there were many  that were never used risk contributors

atlantis orbiter s final welcome home 2011


nasa retired the space shuttle in 2011 after 30 years of service the shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a  space truck  which would among other things be used to build a united states space station in  in the early 1990s when the us space station evolved into the international space station project which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed the retirement of the space shuttle was delayed several times until 2011 serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned discovery was the first of nasa s three remaining operational space shuttles to be retired the final space shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010 but the program was later extended to july 2011 when michael suffredini of the iss program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the international space station the shuttle s final mission consisted of just four astronautschristopher ferguson  commander  douglas hurley  pilot  sandra magnus  mission specialist 1  and rex walheim  mission specialist 2  they conducted the 135th and last space shuttle mission on board atlantis which launched on july 8 2011 and landed safely at the kennedy space center on july 21 2011 at 5 57 am edt  09 57 utc  distribution of orbiters and other hardware

nasa announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the space shuttle program each museum or institution is responsible for covering the us 28.8 million cost of preparing and transporting each vehicle for display twenty museums from across the country submitted proposals for receiving one of the retired orbiters nasa also made  tiles available to schools and universities for less than us 25 each about 7,000 tiles were available on a  basis limited to one per institution orbiters on display 
on april 12 2011 nasa announced selection of locations for the remaining shuttle orbiters

endeavour at los angeles international airport



endeavour was delivered to the  in los angeles california on october 14 2012 it arrived at los angeles international airport on september 21 2012 concluding a two-day cross country journey atop the shuttle carrier aircraft after stops at ellington field in houston biggs army airfield in el paso and the dryden flight research facility at edwards air force base california enterprise  atmospheric test orbiter  was on display at the national air and space museum s udvar-hazy center but was moved to new york city s  in mid-2012 
in august 2011 the   oig  published a  review of nasa s selection of display locations for the space shuttle orbiters  the review had four main findings 

 nasa s decisions regarding orbiter placement were the result of an agency-created process that emphasized above all other considerations locating the orbiters in places where the most people would have the opportunity to view them 
 the team made several errors during its evaluation process including one that would have resulted in a numerical  tie  among the intrepid the kennedy visitor complex and the national museum of the u.s air force  air force museum  in dayton ohio 
there is  no evidence that the teams recommendation or the administrator s decision were tainted by political influence or any other improper consideration 
 some of the choices nasa made during the selection process  specifically its decision to manage aspects of the selection as if it were a competitive procurement and to delay announcement of its placement decisions until april 2011  more than 2 years after it first solicited information from interested entities may intensify challenges to the agency and the selectees as they work to complete the process of placing the orbiters in their new homes 

the nasa oig had three recommendations saying nasa should 

 expeditiously review recipients  financial logistical and curatorial display plans to ensure they are feasible and consistent with the agency s educational goals and processing and delivery schedules 
 ensure that recipient payments are closely coordinated with processing schedules do not impede nasa s ability to efficiently prepare the orbiters for museum display and provide sufficient funds in advance of the work to be performed  and 
 work closely with the recipient organizations to minimize the possibility of delays in the delivery schedule that could increase the agency s costs or impact other nasa missions and priorities 

in september 2011 the ceo and two board members of seattle s museum of flight met with nasa administrator  pointing out  significant errors in deciding where to put its four retiring space shuttles  the errors alleged include inaccurate information on museum of flight s attendance and international visitor statistics as well as the readiness of the  s exhibit site orbiter replicas on display
