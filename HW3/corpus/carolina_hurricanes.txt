franchise history 
new england hartford whalers  19711997 
main article  
the  were established in november 1971 when the   wha  awarded a franchise to begin play in   for the first two years of their existence the club played their home games at the  and  with the increasing difficulty of scheduling games at boston garden  owned by the nhl rival   the owners decided to move the team to  beginning with the  while waiting for the completion of a new arena in hartford the whalers played the first part of the season at  in  on january 11 1975 the team played its first game in front of a sellout crowd at the  and would maintain its home there through 1997 as one of the most stable wha teams the whalers along with the   and  were admitted to the nhl when the rival leagues merged in  however under pressure from the extant nhl team in the  area the boston bruins the whalers were compelled to rename the team the  the whalers were never as successful in the nhl as they had been in the wha recording only three winning seasons they peaked in the mid-to-late 1980s winning their only playoff series in  over the nordiques before bowing out in the second round to the  taking the habs to overtime of game 7 in the process the  the club secured the regular-season  title only to fall to the nordiques in six games in the first round of the playoffs in  the whalers made the playoffs for the final time but were bounced in the first round in seven games by the canadiens the organization retains many whaler connections among its off-ice personnel  in addition to many members of executive management and the coaching staff broadcasters   and   at the time a minor-league player  and equipment managers  skip cunningham and bob gorman all made the move to north carolina with the team finally the old goal horn from the hartford civic center remains in use at pnc arena move to north carolina  19972001 
the whalers were plagued for most of their existence by limited marketability hartford was the smallest american market in the league and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for new york city and boston teams it did not help matters that the hartford civic center was one of the smallest arenas in the league seating just over 15,000 people for hockey the whalers  off-ice problems were magnified when the start of the 1990s triggered a spike in player salaries 



in may 1997 franchise owner  announced that the team would move to north carolina 

despite assurances made when he purchased the team in 1994 that the whalers would remain in hartford at least through 1998 in march 1997 owner  announced that the team would move elsewhere after the  because of the team s inability to negotiate a satisfactory construction and lease package for a new arena in hartford on may 6 1997 karmanos announced that the whalers would move to the  area of  and the new   esa  in  due to the relatively short time frame for the move karmanos himself thought of and decided upon the new name for the club the carolina hurricanes rather than holding a contest as is sometimes done later that summer the team dropped the whalers  colors of blue green and silver for a new black-and-red scheme matching the colors of the  with whose men s basketball team they would share the arena in raleigh the hurricanes inherited the whalers  place in the  unfortunately for the team the esa would not be complete for two more years the only arena in the triangle area with an ice plant was 45-year-old   at 5,100 seats it was completely inadequate even for temporary use the hurricanes were thus forced to play home games in  90 minutes west of raleigh for their first two seasons after the move however the team would be based in raleigh and practice in nearby effectively saddling the hurricanes with 82 road games for the next two years this choice was disastrous for the franchise s attendance and reputation with a capacity of over 21,000 people for hockey the  was the highest-capacity arena in the nhl however triangle-area fans balked at making the 80-mile drive down  to greensboro likewise fans from the  mostly refused to support a lame-duck team that had displaced the popular  minor-league franchise as a result while the opening game drew a sellout  and is still the largest home crowd in franchise history  most games in greensboro attracted crowds of 10,000 or fewer the crowds looked even smaller than that in the cavernous environment furthermore only 29 out of 82 games were televised  over-the-air and cable combined  and radio play-by-play coverage on  was often pre-empted by wolfpack basketball  for whose broadcasts wptf was the flagship station  leaving these games totally unavailable to those who did not have a ticket with by far the smallest season-ticket base in the nhl and attendance figures routinely well below the league average  ran a story titled  natural disaster  and  anchors mocked the  green acres  of empty seats  in a 2006 interview karmanos admitted that  as it turns out  was probably a mistake  under the circumstances the hurricanes managed to stay competitive but still finished last in the northeast division with 74 points nine points out of the playoffs for  the hurricanes curtained off most of the upper deck lowering the coliseum s listed capacity to about 12,000 attendance continued to lag  most games attracted crowds of well under 10,000 on the ice however the  canes were now out of the doldrums  led by the return of longtime whalers captain   s 30 goals and   178  minutes they tallied their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1992 they also won the new  by eight points only their second division title as an nhl team  following the 1987 adams division title as the whalers  however tragedy struck hours after the team s first-round loss to the bruins when   was thrown from his pickup truck and killed in a single-vehicle drunk-driving accident despite their move to the brand-new esa the hurricanes played lackluster hockey in  failing to make the playoffs in  however they claimed the eighth seed nosing out the boston bruins and landed a first-round match-up with the defending champions the  although the devils eliminated the hurricanes in six games the series is seen as the real  arrival  of hockey in the triangle down 30 in the series the hurricanes extended it to a sixth game thereby becoming only the tenth team in nhl history to do so game 6 in raleigh featured their best playoff crowd that year as well as their loudest despite the 51 loss carolina was given a standing ovation by their home crowd as the game ended erasing some of the doubts that the city would not warm up to the team stanley cup finals and slow starts  20012006 
the hurricanes made national waves for the first time in the   they survived a late charge from the  to win the division but expectations were low entering the first round against the defending  champion new jersey devils however  and  were solid in goal and the hurricanes won two games in overtime as they defeated the devils in six games their second-round matchup was against the  who were riding a wave of emotion after their captain  s return from cancer treatment in the third period of game 4 in  down 21 in the series and 30 in the game carolina would tie the game and then win on  s overtime goal the game became known to hurricanes fans as the  miracle at   carolina won the next two games by a combined 133 margin over a dejected habs club to take the series in the eastern conference finals carolina met the heavily-favored  in game 6 in  the leafs   tied the game with 22 seconds remaining to send it to overtime where carolina s  would score to send the franchise to their first  finals appearance during this series several hurricanes fan traditions drew hockey-wide media attention for the first time  fans met the team at  on the return from every road trip and echoedseason habits honed for games  by hosting massive  before each home game a relative novelty in the cold-weather-centric nhl inside the building the  s  lauded the rbc center as  the loudest building in the nhl  praise that would be echoed in 2006 in the  carolina would face the  thought to be the prohibitive favorite all year though the  canes stunned the wings in game 1 when  scored in the first minute of overtime detroit stormed back to win the next four games game 3 in raleigh featured a triple-overtime thriller eventually won by detroit s  the oldest player to score a last-round goal

the hurricanes looked poised to pick up where they left off in  but never recovered from a 10-loss january and finished dead last in the league with 61 points after a similarly slow start to the   who had been the team s coach since midway through their next-to-last season in hartford was fired and replaced with former  bench boss  under laviolette weekes remained tough but the offense was suspect  center  led the team with a mere 19 goals and 26 assists for 45 points many of the new fans attracted to the team  and to hockey itself  during the 2002 playoff run lost interest and attendance declined one of the few positive results of these losing years however was the team s drafting of future star  in  stanley cup champions 
the outcome of the  led to the shrinking of the payroll to  26million the hurricanes however turned out to be one of the nhl s biggest surprises turning in the best season in the franchise s 34-year history they finished the regular season with a 52228 record and 112 points shattering the previous franchise records of 94 points  in the wha  set by the 197273 whalers and 93 points  in the nhl  set in  it was the first time ever that the franchise had passed the 50-win and 100-point plateaus the 112-point figure was good for fourth overall in the league easily their highest overall finish as an nhl team  tied with the third-overall  in points but with one fewer win than the stars  and second in the east  one point behind the   the hurricanes also ran away with their third southeast division title finishing 20 points ahead of the  attendance increased from 200304 averaging just under 15,600 per game and the team made a profit for the first time since the move from hartford in the playoffs after losing the first two games of the conference quarterfinal series against the  laviolette lifted goalkeeper   who had been struggling to regain his form after playing through a bout of intestinal flu  in favor of rookie  the hurricanes went on to win both games in montreal tying up the playoff series and turning the momentum around winning the series on a game 6 overtime goal by  carolina then faced the  in the conference semi-finals which proved surprisingly one-sided as the hurricanes beat the devils in five games stillman struck again once again scoring the series-winning goal in the eastern conference finals the hurricanes faced the  who had finished just one spot behind the hurricanes in the overall standings the contentious series saw both coaches   and laviolette  taking public verbal shots at each other s team but in the deciding game 7 the hurricanes rallied with three goals in the third to win by a score of 42  scored the game winner as the hurricanes reached the stanley cup finals for the second time in team history 



the hurricanes celebrate following their  victory in the  

the  were against the  the first time in nhl history that two former wha franchises had played against one another in the finals the hurricanes rallied from a 30 deficit in game 1 to win 54 after rod brind amour scored with 30 seconds left in game 2 the hurricanes shelled the oilers 50 to take a two-game lead the oilers won game 3 in  21 as  scored the game-winning goal with 2 47 left to play carolina rebounded in game 4 with a 21 victory and came home with a chance to win the cup on home ice however game 5 saw the oilers come back with a stunning 43 overtime win on a shorthanded breakaway by  in game 6 in edmonton carolina was soundly defeated 40  the only bright point for the hurricanes was the return of forward  from a broken neck that had sidelined him since march in game 7 before the second-largest home crowd in franchise history  18,978  the hurricanes won 31 sealing the hurricanes  first stanley cup championship in franchise history ward was honored with the  for the playoffs   becoming just the fourth rookie to be honored with the award several hurricanes raised the cup for the first time in their long nhl careers  rod brind amour and  had both played over 15 years without winning the cup while   the last remaining hartford whaler on the hurricanes  roster  had waited 18 seasons the hurricanes stanley cup championship marked the first professional major league sports title for a team from north carolina as well they were the first nhl team to win the stanley cup despite losing at least nine playoff games in that year  the 2011  the 2014  and the 2017  are the only other teams to have accomplished the feat post-championship slump  2006present 
the hurricanes were unable to follow up their success losing four players to free agency in the offseason and 222-man games to injury during  the team struggled throughout the regular season and once eliminated in the last game the hurricanes finished third in the southeast and 11th overall in the eastern conference this finish made them the first champions since the 193839  to have failed to qualify for the playoffs both the seasons before and after their championship season and the third champion overall to not defend its title after both the black hawks and the 1995 new jersey devils in  carolina again missed out as  stormed back to take the division title on the last day of the season leaving the hurricanes second in the division and ninth overall in the conference and making the  canes only the second club in nhl history to miss the playoffs for two seasons running after a cup triumph
