design and development 
on august 21 1998 a phase 1 aerosonde nicknamed   after the ancient  of good fortune completed a 2,031 mile  3,270km  flight across the  this was the first crossing of the atlantic ocean by a   at the time it was also the smallest aircraft ever to cross the atlantic  the smallest aircraft record was subsequently broken by the  uav  launched from a roof rack of a moving car due to its lack of undercarriage laima flew from   to benbecula an island off the coast of  in 26hours 45minutes in stormy weather using approximately 1.5 u.s gallons  1.25 imperial gallons or 5.7 litres  of gasoline  petrol  other than for take-off and landing the flight was autonomous without external control at an altitude of 5,500ft  1,680meters  aerosondes have also been the first unmanned aircraft to penetrate tropical cyclones with an initial mission in 2001 followed by eye penetrations in 2005 operational history 
on 5 march 2012 the   socom  awarded aai a contract to provide the aerosonde-g for their mid-endurance uas ii program the catapult-launched air vehicle has a takeoff weight 39 or 55lb  18 or 25kg  depending on engine type with endurance of over 10 hours and an electro-optic infrared and laser-pointer payload the aerosonde has been employed by socom and u.s   navair  under the designation mq-19 under service provision contracts a typical system comprises four air vehicles and two ground control stations that are accommodated in tents or tailored to fit in most vehicles the system can also include remote video terminals for individual users to uplink new navigation waypoints and sensor commands to and receive sensor imagery and video from the vehicle from a ruggedized  device originally the aerosonde suffered from engine-reliability issues but textron says it has rectified those issues by november 2015  was performing aerosonde operations in  eight or nine  countries for its users including the   and socom as well as for commercial users consisting of a customer in the oil and gas industry instead of buying hardware customers pay for  sensor hours  and the company decides how many aircraft are produced to meet requirements 4,000 fee-for-service hours were being performed monthly and the aerosonde had exceeded 110,000 flight hours in service variants
