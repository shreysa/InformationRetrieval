crew
on 31 july 2010 the expedition 24 crew was awoken by an alarm on the station the alarm was caused by a cooling pump that had failed and caused a  to trip and cut power to some of the international space station  iss  astronauts tracy caldwell dyson and doug wheelock performed some steps to assist ground controllers in re-powering some of the station components such as two main power buses and one  after the steps had been completed   told the crew they could go back to bed as all the work required by the crew on the iss was complete a short time later another alarm sounded and awoke the crew when the ground attempted to restart the pump module docking ring 
a failure in the docking ring on the mini-research module 2  mrm2   caused a delay in the planned landing of the  spacecraft soyuz tma-18 was originally planned to undock and land on 24 september 2010 but instead undocked less than 24 hours later on 25 september 2010 the failure is believed to be due to a faulty indication from a micro-switch on the hatch between the soyuz and mrm2 a drive gear which is related to the docking mechanism was also found to have two broken teeth and is believed to be related to the problem as well spacewalks
