on october14 and october15 the  associated with the hurricane s precursor dropped heavy rainfall on bermuda amounting to 76mm  3.0in  however as a tropical cyclone michael remained far from the island impact outside newfoundland was generally light however rainfall was greater in some areas of nova scotia than in newfoundland where precipitation reached 95.7mm  3.77in  over  light rain was also reported in   and  effects from the storm in the united states were minimal limited to light rainfall in the state of maine which totaled less than 51mm  2.0in  see also
