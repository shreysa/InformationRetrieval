an atmospheric sounding is a measurement of vertical distribution of physical properties of the  column such as    and   thus deriving   liquid water content  concentration pollution and other properties such measurements are performed in a variety of ways including  and  observations the most common in situ sounding is a  which usually is a  but can also be a  remote sensing soundings generally use passive  and   

airborne instruments
surface stations
earth-observing satellite instruments such as  and 
observation of atmospheres on different planets such as the  on the

direct methods 
sensors that measure atmospheric constituents directly such as thermometers barometers and humidity sensors can be sent aloft on balloons rockets or  they can also be carried on the outer hulls of ships and aircraft or even mounted on towers in this case all that is needed to capture the measurements are storage devices and or  indirect methods 
the more challenging case involves sensors primarily satellite-mounted such as  optical sensors   and  as well as  since these cannot measure the quantity of interest such as temperature pressure humidity etc directly by understanding emission and absorption processes we can figure out what the instrument is looking at between the layers of atmosphere while this type of instrument can also be operated from ground stations or vehiclesoptical methods can also be used inside in situ instrumentssatellite instruments are particularly important because of their extensive regular coverage the  instruments on three  and two  satellites for instance can sample the entire globe at better than one degree resolution in less than a day we can distinguish between two broad classes of sensor  active such as  that have their own source and passive that only detect what is already there there can be a variety of sources for a passive instrument including scattered radiation light emitted directly from the sun moon or starsboth more appropriate in the visual or ultra-violet rangeas well light emitted from warm objects which is more appropriate in the microwave and infrared viewing geometry 
a limb sounder looks at the edge of the atmosphere where it is visible above the earth it does this in one of two ways  either it tracks the sun moon a star or another transmitting satellite through the limb as the source gets  behind the earth or it looks towards empty space collecting radiation that is scattered from one of these sources in contrast alooking atmospheric sounder looks down through the atmosphere at the surface the  instrument operates in all three of these modes atmospheric inverse problem
the following applies mainly to passive sensors but has some applicability to active sensors typically there is a vector of values of the quantity to be retrieved  called the state vector and a vector of measurements  the state vector could be temperatures ozone number densities humidities etc the measurement vector is typically counts radiances or brightness temperatures from a radiometer or similar detector but could include any other quantity germain to the problem the forward model maps the state vector to the measurement vector 



usually the mapping  is known from physical first principles but this may not always be the case instead it may only be known  by matching actual measurements with actual states satellite and many other  instruments do not measure the relevant physical properties that is the state but rather the amount of radiation emitted in a particular direction at a particular frequency it is usually easy to go from the state space to the measurement spacefor instance with  or but not the other way around therefore we need some method of   or of finding the inverse model  methods of solution 
if the problem is  we can use some type of matrix inverse methodoften the problem is  or  so we will need to  it  good simple methods include the  or  if the problem is weakly nonlinear an iterative method such  may be appropriate sometimes the physics is too complicated to model accurately or the forward model too slow to be used effectively in the inverse method in this case  or  methods such as     etc can be used to form an inverse model based on a collection of ordered pairs of samples mapping the state space to the measurement space that is  these can be generated either from modelse.g state vectors from dynamical models and measurement vectors from radiative transfer or similar forward modelsor from direct empirical measurement other times when a statistical method might be more appropriate include highly  problems list of methods
