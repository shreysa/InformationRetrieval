numerical integration of a differential-difference equation with a decreasing time-lag systems in which variable time-lags are present are of common occurrence in biology variable flow rates are a common cause of these variable lags at present no extensive body of knowledge exists concerning the effects which these variable lags can cause shown here is a method of reducing some differential-difference equations to ordinary differential equations which can then be studied numerically with ease subsequent study will deal with situations in which multiple-lags and lags dependent on the solution itself are present cacm April, 1965 Bellman, R.
