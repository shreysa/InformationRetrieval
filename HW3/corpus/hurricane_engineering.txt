hurricane engineering is a specialist sub-discipline of  that encompasses planning analysis design response and recovery of civil engineering systems and infrastructure for  hazards hurricane engineering is a relatively new and emerging discipline within the field of civil engineering it is an integration of many recognized branches of engineering such as    and  with other recognized sciences and planning functions such as     and preparedness hazard mitigation and hazard vulnerability analysis hurricane engineering aims to minimize risks to human safety the natural and built environment and business processes as a result of the tremendous threats to life safety and economic disruptions caused by the  and  hurricane seasons governmental organizations such as the united states  have recognized the need to better understand hurricane threats and further establish this discipline in september 2006 the  released recommendations to the  calling for major new investments in hurricane science and engineering accredited university engineering programs such as the  civil engineering department and  department of civil engineering and geological sciences are establishing programs to better understand these catastrophic storms and their interaction with the environment the lsu hurricane center has begun to offer hurricane engineering courses with the focus of educating students on the unique threats caused by hurricanes in the northwest pacific where the term for strong tropical cyclones is typhoon instead of hurricane the concept of typhoon engineering which is very similar to hurricane engineering is being proposed the past two decades have witnessed exponential growth in damage due to hurricanes and the situation continues to deteriorate the most vulnerable areas coastal counties along the gulf and atlantic seaboards are experiencing greater population growth and development than anyplace else in the country if the trend of rapidly increasing losses caused by hurricanes is to be reversed a whole new philosophy of understanding planning and preparedness is required the hurricane engineering curriculum is the result of a multidisciplinary project aimed at giving engineering students a comprehensive understanding of the hazards associated with hurricanes 

extreme winds
windborne debris
