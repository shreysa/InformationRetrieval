a fire whirl with flames in the vortex


a fire whirl  also commonly known as a fire devil or  in many cases  erroneously as a fire tornado firenado or fire twister  is a  induced by a  and often made up of flame or ash they usually start with a whirl of wind or smoke fire whirls may occur when intense rising heat and turbulent wind conditions combine to form whirling  of air these eddies can contract into alike  that sucks in burning debris and combustible gases fire whirls are sometimes colloquially called fire tornadoes but are not usually classifiable as tornadoes as the vortex in most cases does not extend from the surface to cloud base also even in such cases even those fire whirls are not classic tornadoes in that their  derives from surface  and heat-induced lifting rather than a tornadic  aloft the literal fire tornado is a rare phenomenon much more powerful and destructive than the a typical fire whirl in which the  generates a  cloud that then  when this tornado forms in or enters the fire zone it fans flames enormously draws flame and burning debris into itself and scatters burning debris over a wide area

formation 
a fire whirl consists of a burning core and a rotating pocket of air a fire whirl can reach up to 2,000f  1,090c  often fire whirls are created when a wildfire or firestorm creates its own wind which can turn into a vortex of fire this causes the tall and skinny appearance of a fire whirl s core most of the largest fire whirls are spawned from  they form when a warm  and convergence from the wildfire are present they are usually 10-50 meters tall a few meters wide and last only a few minutes however some can be more than a kilometer tall contain  over 160 km h and persist for more than 20 minutes fire whirls can uproot trees up to 15 metres  49ft  tall these can also aid the  spotting  ability of wildfires to propagate and start new fires as they lift burning materials such as tree bark these burning embers can be blown away from the fireground by the stronger winds aloft examples 




another fire whirl


an extreme example of a fire tornado is the  in japan which ignited a large city-sized  and produced a gigantic fire whirl that killed 38,000 people in fifteen minutes in the hifukusho-ato region of  another example is the numerous large fire whirls  some tornadic  that developed after  struck an oil storage facility near   on 7 april 1926 several of which produced significant structural damage well away from the fire killing two many whirlwinds were produced by the four-day-long firestorm coincident with conditions that produced severe  in which the larger fire whirls carried debris 5 kilometers away a fire whirl of reportedly uncommon size for new zealand wildfires formed on day three of the  in  pilots estimated the fire column to be 100 metres  330ft  high classification 
there are currently three known types of fire whirls 

type 1  stable and centered over burning area type 2  stable or transient downwind of burning area type 3  steady or transient centered over an open area adjacent to an asymmetric burning area with wind 
there is evidence suggesting that the fire whirl in the hifukusho-ato area during the great kanto earthquake of 1923 was of type 3 references
