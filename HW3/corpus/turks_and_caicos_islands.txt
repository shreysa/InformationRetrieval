however in the mid-2000s the issue of independence for the islands was again raised in april 2006 pnp premier  reaffirmed that his party saw independence from britain as the  ultimate goal  for the islands but not at the present time in 2008 opponents of misick accused him of moving toward independence for the islands to dodge a commission of inquiry which examined reports of corruption by the misick administration administrative divisions

in 2008 after members of the british parliament conducting a routine review of the administration received several reports of high-level official corruption in the turks and caicos then-governor  announced the appointment of a commission of enquiry into corruption the same year premier  himself became the focus of a criminal investigation after a woman identified by news outlets as an american citizen residing in puerto rico accused him of sexually assaulting her although he strongly denies the charge on monday 16 march 2009 the uk threatened to suspend self-government in the islands and transfer power to the new governor  over  on 18 march 2009 on the advice of her uk ministers  issued an  giving the governor the power to suspend those parts of the 2006 constitution that deal with ministerial government and the  and to exercise the powers of government himself the order which would also establish an advisory council and consultative forum in place of the house of assembly would come into force on a date to be announced by the governor and remain in force for two years unless extended or revoked on 23 march 2009 after the enquiry found evidence of  high probability of systemic corruption or other serious dishonesty  misick resigned as premier to make way for a new unified government politicians were accused of selling crown land for personal gain and misusing public funds the following day  was sworn in as his replacement misick denied all charges and referred to the british government s debate on whether to remove the territory s sovereignty as  tantamount to being re-colonised it is a backwards step completely contrary to the whole movement of history 
suspension and reactions 
on 14 august 2009 after misick s last appeals failed the governor on the instructions of the  imposed direct rule on the turks and caicos islands by authority of the 18 march 2009  issued by the queen the islands  administration was suspended for up to two years with possible extensions and power was transferred to the governor with the united kingdom also stationing a supply vessel in between turks and caicos   said of the decision to impose rule  this is a serious constitutional step which the uk government has not taken lightly but these measures are essential in order to restore good governance and sound financial management 
the move was met with vehement opposition by the former turks and caicos government with misick s successor williams calling it a   and stating that  our country is being invaded and re by the united kingdom dismantling a duly elected government and legislature and replacing it with a one-man  akin to that of the old red china all in the name of good governance  despite this the civilian populace was reported to be largely welcoming of the enforced rule the british government stated that they intended to keep true to their word that the country would regain home rule in two years or less and foreign office minister chris bryant said that elections would be held in 2011  or sooner  governor wetherell stated that he would aim to  make a clean break from the mistakes of the past  and create  a durable path towards good governance sound financial management and sustainable development  wetherell added   in the meantime we must all learn to foster a quality of public spirit listen to all those who have the long-term interests of these islands at heart and safeguard the fundamental assets of the territory for future generations our guiding principles will be those of transparency accountability and responsibility i believe that most people in the turks and caicos will welcome these changes
