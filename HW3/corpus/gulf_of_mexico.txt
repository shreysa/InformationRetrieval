geology 




 in the gulf of mexico


the consensus among geologists who have studied the geology of the gulf of mexico is that prior to the late  the gulf of mexico did not exist before the late triassic the area now occupied by the gulf of mexico consisted of dry land which included continental crust that now underlies  within the middle of the large supercontinent of  this land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central mexico through the  in west  and the  of  and to  where it linked directly to the  it was created by the collision of continental plates that formed pangea as interpreted by roy van arsdale and randel t cox this mountain range was breached in late  times by the formation of the  geologists and other earth scientists agree in general that the present gulf of mexico basin originated in late triassic time as the result of  within pangea the rifting was associated with zones of weakness within pangea including sutures where the  south american and african plates collided to create it first there was a late triassic-early  phase of rifting during which  formed and filled with continental  second as rifting progressed through early and middle jurassic time continental crust was stretched and thinned this thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust which is half the typical thickness 35  of normal continental crust it was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the pacific ocean across central mexico and later eastward to the atlantic ocean this flooded the subsiding basin created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the gulf of mexico while the gulf of mexico was a restricted basin the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of  and associated   initially during the late jurassic continued rifting widened the gulf of mexico and progressed to the point that  and formation of  occurred at this point sufficient circulation with the atlantic ocean was established that the deposition of louann salt ceased during the late jurassic through early cretaceous the basin occupied by the gulf of mexico experienced a period of cooling and subsidence of the crust underlying it the subsidence was the result of a combination of crustal stretching cooling and loading initially the combination of crustal stretching and cooling caused about 57km of tectonic subsidence of the central thin transitional and oceanic crust because subsidence occurred faster than sediment could fill it the gulf of mexico expanded and deepened later loading of the crust within the gulf of mexico and adjacent coastal plain by the accumulation of kilometers of sediments during the rest of the  and all of the  further depressed the underlying crust to its current position about 1020km below sea level particularly during the cenozoic thick  built out the continental shelf along the northwestern and northern margins of the gulf of mexico to the east the stable  was not covered by the sea until the latest jurassic or the beginning of cretaceous time the yucatn platform was emergent until the mid-cretaceous after both platforms were submerged the formation of  and  has characterized the geologic history of these two stable areas most of the basin was rimmed during the early cretaceous by carbonate platforms and its western flank was involved during the latest cretaceous and early  periods in a compressive deformation episode the  which created the  of eastern mexico in 2002 geologist michael stanton published a speculative essay suggesting an  for the gulf of mexico at the close of the  which could have caused the  however gulf coast geologists do not regard this hypothesis as having any credibility instead they overwhelmingly accept plate tectonics not an asteroid impact as having created the gulf of mexico as illustrated by papers authored by kevin mickus and others this hypothesis is not to be confused with the  a large impact crater on the coast of the gulf of mexico on the yucatn peninsula today the gulf of mexico has the following 7 main areas 

 which contains the  and can be further divided into the continental rise the  and the   which extends from a point east of the  near  to the eastern side of   which extends along the coast from apalachee bay to the  and includes the florida keys and   which extends from the  in the east to the  in the west and includes   which is an isthmian  extending from the western edge of campeche bank to the offshore regions just east of the port of   which is located between veracruz to the south and the  to the north  which extends from alabama to the rio grande

the major environmental threats to the gulf are  and  there are frequent   algae blooms that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore this has especially been plaguing the southwest and southern florida coast from the florida keys to north of  the gulf contains a   that runs east-west along the texas-louisiana coastline in july 2008 researchers reported that between 1985 and 2008 the area roughly doubled in size and now stretches from near  to near  it is now about 8,000 square miles  21,000km2  nearly the record poor agricultural practices in the northern portion of the gulf of mexico have led to a tremendous increase of  and  in neighboring marine ecosystems which has resulted in  blooms and a lack of available oxygen occurrences of  and estrogen suppression were observed as a result an october 2007 study of the  found a disproportioned sex ratio of 61 males to 39 females in hypoxic gulf sites this was compared with a 52 to 48 male-female ratio found in reference sites showing an impairment of reproductive output for fish populations inhabiting hypoxic coastal zones there are 27,000 abandoned oil and gas wells beneath the gulf these have generally not been checked for potential environmental problems ixtoc i explosion and oil spill
