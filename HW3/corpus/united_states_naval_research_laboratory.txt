history
artifacts found on the nrl campus such as  and ceramic shards show that the site had been inhabited since the late   granted the tract of land including the present nrl campus to william middleton in 1663 it became part of the  in 1791 and was purchased by thomas grafton addison in 1795 who named the area  and built a mansion on the highlands to the east zachariah berry purchased the land in 1827 who rented it out for various purposes including a  at  the mansion was demolished during the civil war to build  in 1873 the land was purchased by the federal government as the bellevue annex to the  and several buildings were constructed including the commandant s house  quarters a  which is still in use today foundation 




nrl in 1923 the first year of its existence showing the first five buildings on its campus


the naval research laboratory came into existence from an idea that originated from  in a may 1915 editorial piece in the new york times magazine edison wrote   the government should maintain a great research laboratory in this could be developed...all the technique of military and  progression without any vast expense  this statement addressed concerns about world war i in the united states edison then agreed to serve as the head of the naval consulting board that consisted of civilians who had achieved expertise the focus of the naval consulting board was as advisor to the u.s navy pertaining to science and technology the board brought forward a plan to create a modern facility for the navy in 1916 congress allocated  1.5million for implementation however construction was delayed until 1920 because of the war and internal disagreements within the board the u.s naval research laboratory the first modern research institution created within the united states navy began operations at 1100 on 2 july 1923 the laboratory s two original divisions  radio and sound  performed research in the fields of high-frequency radio and underwater sound propagation they produced communications equipment direction-finding devices sonar sets and perhaps most significant of all the first practical  equipment built in the united states they performed basic research participating for example in the discovery and early exploration of the  moreover the nrl was able to work gradually toward its goal of becoming a broadly based research facility by the beginning of  five new divisions had been added  physical optics chemistry metallurgy mechanics and electricity and internal communications world war ii years and growth 




nrl in 1944 after significant wartime growth


total employment at the nrl jumped from 396 in 1941 to 4400 in 1946 expenditures from  1.7million to  13.7million the number of buildings from 23 to 67 and the number of projects from 200 to about 900 during world war ii scientific activities necessarily were concentrated almost entirely on applied research new electronics equipment  radio    was developed countermeasures were devised new lubricants were produced as were antifouling paints luminous identification tapes and a sea marker to help save survivors of disasters at sea a thermal diffusion process was conceived and used to supply some of the u-235 isotope needed for one of the first atomic bombs also many new devices that developed from booming wartime industry were type tested and then certified as reliable for the fleet after wwii 




nrl in 2001


as a result of the scientific accomplishments of the wwii the united states emerged into the postwar era determined to consolidate its wartime gains in science and technology and to preserve the working relationship between its armed forces and the scientific community while the navy was establishing the   onr  as a liaison with and supporter of basic and applied scientific research the navy encouraged nrl to broaden its scope since it was the navy department s corporate research laboratory nrl was placed under the administrative oversight of onr after onr was created nrl s commanding officer reports to the navy s chief of naval research  cnr  the chief of naval research leads the office of naval research which primarily is located in the ballston area of arlington virginia the reorganization also caused a parallel shift of the laboratory s emphasis to one of long-range basic and applied research in the full range of the physical sciences however rapid expansion during the war had left nrl improperly structured to address long-term navy requirements one major task  neither easily nor rapidly accomplished  was that of reshaping and coordinating research this was achieved by transforming a group of largely autonomous scientific divisions into a unified institution with a clear mission and a fully coordinated research program the first attempt at reorganization vested power in an executive committee composed of all the division superintendents this committee was impracticably large so in 1949 a civilian director of research was named and given full authority over the program positions for associate directors were added in 1954 modern era 
in 1992 the previously separate naval oceanographic and atmospheric research laboratory  noarl  with centers in bay st louis mississippi and monterey california was merged into nrl since then nrl is also the lead navy center for research in oceanographic and atmospheric sciences with special strengths in physical oceanography marine geosciences ocean acoustics marine meteorology and remote oceanic and atmospheric sensing see also
