on february 1 2003 the  disintegrated upon   killing all seven crew members the disaster was the second fatal accident in the  after  which  and killed the seven-member crew 73 seconds after liftoff in 1986 during the launch of  columbia s 28th mission a piece of foam insulation broke off from the  and struck the left wing of the  a few previous shuttle launches had seen damage ranging from minor to major from foam shedding but some engineers suspected that the damage to columbia was more serious  managers limited the investigation reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed when columbia re-entered the  the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart after the disaster space shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years as they had been after the  construction of the   iss  was put on hold  the station relied entirely on the russian  for resupply for 29 months until shuttle flights resumed with  and 41 months for crew rotation until  several technical and organizational changes were made including adding a thorough on-orbit inspection to determine how well the shuttle s  had endured the ascent and keeping a designated rescue mission ready in case irreparable damage was found except for  to repair the  subsequent shuttle missions were flown only to the iss so that the crew could use it as a haven in case damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry

the shuttle s  is covered in  foam intended to prevent ice from forming when the tank is full of  and  such ice could damage the shuttle if shed during lift-off mission  was the 113th space shuttle launch planned to begin on january 11 2001 the mission was delayed 18times and eventually launched on january 16 2003 following   the columbia accident investigation board determined that this delay had nothing to do with the catastrophic failure 
about 82seconds after launch from  s lc-39-a a suitcase-sized piece of foam broke off from the external tank  et  striking columbia s left wing   rcc  panels as demonstrated by ground experiments conducted by the columbia accident investigation board this likely created a 6-to-10-inch  15 to 25cm  diameter hole allowing hot gases to enter the wing when columbia later re-entered the atmosphere at the time of the foam strike the orbiter was at an altitude of about 66,000 feet  20km  12.5mi  traveling at mach2.46  1,626 miles per hour or 727 meters per second  the left bipod foam ramp is an approximately three-foot  one-meter  long aerodynamic component made entirely of foam the foam not normally considered to be a structural material is required to bear some aerodynamic loads because of these special requirements the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a senior technician the bipod ramp  having left and right sides  was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the bipod attachment points at the external tank but it was proven unnecessary in the wake of the accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after sts-107  another foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to eliminate it as a foam debris source after analysis and tests proved this change safe  bipod ramp insulation had been observed falling off in whole or in part on four previous flights    1983    1990    1992  and most recently   just two launches before sts-107  all affected shuttle missions completed successfully nasa management came to refer to this phenomenon as  foam shedding  as with the  erosion problems that ultimately doomed the  nasa management became accustomed to these phenomena when no serious consequences resulted from these earlier episodes this phenomenon was termed  normalization of deviance  by sociologist  in her book on the  as it happened sts-112 had been the first flight with the  et cam  a video feed mounted on the et for the purpose of giving greater insight to the foam shedding problem during that launch a chunk of foam broke away from the et bipod ramp and hit the srb-et attach ring near the bottom of the left  causing a dent four inches wide and three inches deep in it after sts-112 nasa leaders analyzed the situation and decided to press ahead under the justification that  he et is safe to fly with no new concerns  and no added risk  of further foam strikes video taken during lift-off of sts-107 was routinely reviewed two hours later and revealed nothing unusual the following day higher-resolution film that had been processed overnight revealed the foam debris striking the left wing potentially damaging the thermal protection on the space shuttle at the time the exact location where the foam struck the wing could not be determined due to the low resolution of the tracking camera footage meanwhile nasa s judgment about the risks was revisited  chair of the mission management team  mmt  said  rationale was lousy then and still is  ham and shuttle program manager  had both been present at the october 31 2002 meeting where the decision to continue with launches was made post-disaster analysis revealed that two previous shuttle launches   and   also had bipod ramp foam loss that went undetected in addition protuberance air load  pal  ramp foam had also shed pieces and there were also spot losses from large-area foams flight risk management 
in a risk-management scenario similar to the challenger disaster nasa management failed to recognize the relevance of engineering concerns for safety and suggestions for imaging to inspect possible damage and failed to respond to engineers  requests about the status of astronaut inspection of the left wing engineers made three separate requests for   dod  imaging of the shuttle in orbit to determine damage more precisely while the images were not guaranteed to show the damage the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination nasa management did not honor the requests and in some cases intervened to stop the dod from assisting the caib recommended subsequent shuttle flights be imaged while in orbit using ground-based or space-based dod assets details of the dod s unfulfilled participation with columbia remain secret  retired nasa official  stated in 2012 that  activity regarding other national assets and agencies remains classified and i cannot comment on that aspect of the columbia tragedy  throughout the risk assessment process senior nasa managers were influenced by their belief that nothing could be done even if damage were detected this affected their stance on investigation urgency thoroughness and possible contingency actions they decided to conduct a parametric  what-if  scenario study more suited to determine risk probabilities of future events instead of inspecting and assessing the actual damage the investigation report in particular singled out nasa manager  for exhibiting this attitude in 2013 hale recalled that director of mission operations jon c harpold told him before columbia s destruction 

you know there is nothing we can do about damage to the tps  if it has been damaged it s probably better not to know i think the crew would rather not know don t you think it would be better for them to have a happy successful flight and die unexpectedly during entry than to stay on orbit knowing that there was nothing to be done until the air ran out 

much of the risk assessment hinged on damage predictions to the thermal protection system these fall into two categories  damage to the silica tile on the wing lower surface and damage to the   rcc  leading-edge panels the tps includes a third category of components thermal insulating blankets but damage predictions are not typically performed on them damage assessments on the thermal blankets can be performed after an anomaly has been observed and this has been done at least once after the return to flight following columbia s loss before the flight nasa believed that the rcc was very durable  who worked on tile-damage scenarios and repair methods early in his astronaut career said in 2004 that 

never did we talk about  because we all thought that it was impenetrable  i spent fourteen years in the space program flying thinking that i had this huge mass that was about five or six inches thick on the leading edge of the wing and to find after columbia that it was fractions of an inch thick and that it wasn t as strong as the fiberglass on your  that was an eye-opener and i think for all of us  the best minds that i know of in and outside of nasa never envisioned that as a failure mode 
damage-prediction software was used to evaluate possible tile and rcc damage the tool for predicting tile damage was known as  crater  described by several nasa representatives in press briefings as not actually a software program but rather a statistical spreadsheet of observed past flight events and effects the  crater  tool predicted severe penetration of multiple tiles by the impact if it struck the tps tile area but nasa engineers downplayed this it had been shown that the model overstated damage from small projectiles and engineers believed that the model would also overstate damage from larger spray-on foam insulation  sofi  impacts the program used to predict rcc damage was based on small ice impacts the size of cigarette butts not larger sofi impacts as the ice impacts were the only recognized threats to rcc panels up to that point under one of 15 predicted sofi impact paths the software predicted an ice impact would completely penetrate the rcc panel engineers downplayed this too believing that impacts of the less dense sofi material would result in less damage than ice impacts in an e-mail exchange nasa managers questioned whether the density of the sofi could be used as justification for reducing predicted damage despite engineering concerns about the energy imparted by the sofi material nasa managers ultimately accepted the rationale to reduce predicted damage of the rcc panels from possible complete penetration to slight damage to the panel s thin coating ultimately the nasa mission management team felt there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the strike was an unsafe situation so they declared the debris strike a  turnaround  issue  not of highest importance  and denied the requests for the  images on january 23 flight director steve stich sent an e-mail to columbia informing commander husband and pilot mccool of the foam strike while unequivocally dismissing any concerns about entry safety 
during ascent at approximately 80 seconds photo analysis shows that some debris from the area of they et bipod attach point came loose and subsequently impacted the orbiter left wing in the area of transition from chine to main wing creating a shower of smaller particles the impact appears to be totally on the lower surface and no particles are seen to traverse over the upper surface of the wing experts have reviewed the high speed photography and there is no concern for rcc or tile damage we have seen this same phenomenon on several other flights and there is absolutely no concern for entry 
edward tufte an expert in information design and presentation remarked on poor modes of communication during the assessment made on the ground before columbia s reentry nasa and boeing favored microsoft powerpoint for conveying information powerpoint uses multi-level bullet points and orients towards single-page-of-information groupings this is not ideal for complex scientific and engineering reports and may have caused recipients to draw incorrect conclusions in particular the slide format may have emphasized optimistic options and glossed over the more accurate pessimistic viewpoints re-entry timeline 
columbia was scheduled to land at 9 16a.m est 
2 30a.m est february 1 2003  the entry  began duty in the mission control center  known today as the   

the flight control team had not been working on any issues or problems related to the planned de-orbit and re-entry of columbia in particular the team had indicated no concerns about the debris that hit the left wing during ascent and treated the re-entry like any other the team worked through the de-orbit preparation checklist and re-entry checklist procedures weather forecasters with the help of pilots in the  evaluated landing-site weather conditions at the kennedy space center 

8 00  mission control center entry flight director  polled the mission control room for a go no-go decision for the de-orbit burn 

all weather observations and forecasts were within guidelines set by the flight rules and all systems were normal 

8 10  the capsule communicator  capcom  told the crew that they were go for de-orbit burn 8 15 30  ei-1719  husband and mccool executed the de-orbit burn using columbias two orbital maneuvering system engines 

the orbiter was upside down and tail-first over the  at an altitude of 175 miles  282km  and speed of 17,500 miles per hour  7.8km s  when the burn was executed a 2-minute 38-second de-orbit burn during the 255th orbit slowed the orbiter to begin its re-entry into the atmosphere the burn proceeded normally putting the crew under about one-tenth gravity husband then turned columbia right side up facing forward with the nose pitched up

as columbia descended the heat of reentry caused wing leading-edge temperatures to rise steadily reaching an estimated 2,500f  1,370c  during the next six minutes  as former space shuttle program manager wayne hale said in a press briefing about 90 of this heating is the result of compression of the atmospheric gas caused by the orbiter s supersonic flight rather than the result of friction 





columbia at about 8 57 debris is visible coming from the left wing  bottom  the image was taken at  at  


8 48 39  ei 270  a sensor on the left wing leading edge spar showed strains higher than those seen on previous columbia re-entries 

this was recorded only on the modular auxiliary data system which is similar in concept to a  and was not sent to ground controllers or shown to the crew 

8 49 32  ei 323  columbia executed a planned roll to the right speed   24.5 

columbia began a banking turn to manage lift and therefore limit the orbiter s rate of descent and heating 

8 50 53  ei 404  columbia entered a 10-minute period of peak heating during which the thermal stresses were at their maximum speed  mach 24.1  altitude  243,000 feet  74km  46.0mi  8 52 00  ei 471  columbia was about 300 miles  480km  west of the  coastline 

the wing leading-edge temperatures usually reached 2,650f  1,450c  at this point 

8 53 26  ei 557  columbia crossed the california coast west of  speed  mach 23  altitude  231,600 feet  70.6km  43.86mi

the orbiter s wing leading edge typically reached more than 2,800f  1,540c  at this point 

8 53 46  ei 577  various people on the ground saw signs of debris being shed speed  mach 22.8  altitude  230,200 feet  70.2km  43.60mi  

the superheated air surrounding the orbiter suddenly brightened causing a streak in the orbiter s luminescent trail that was quite noticeable in the pre-dawn skies over the west coast observers witnessed four similar events during the following 23seconds dialogue on some of the amateur footage indicates the observers were aware of the abnormality of what they were filming 

8 54 24  ei 615  the maintenance mechanical and crew systems  mmacs  officer told the flight director that four hydraulic sensors in the left wing were indicating  off-scale low  in mission control re-entry had been proceeding normally up to this point 

 off-scale low  is a reading that falls below the minimum capability of the sensor and it usually indicates that the sensor has stopped functioning due to internal or external factors not that the quantity it measures is actually below the sensor s minimum response value 

8 54 25  ei 616  columbia crossed from california into  airspace speed  mach 22.5  altitude  227,400 feet  69.3km  43.07mi  

witnesses observed a bright flash at this point and 18 similar events in the next four minutes 

8 55 00  ei 651  nearly 11 minutes after columbia re-entered the atmosphere wing leading-edge temperatures normally reached nearly 3,000f  1,650c  8 55 32  ei 683  columbia crossed from nevada into  speed  mach 21.8  altitude  223,400 feet  68.1km  42.31mi  8 55 52  ei 703  columbia crossed from utah into  8 56 30  ei 741  columbia began a roll reversal turning from right to left over arizona 8 56 45  ei 756  columbia crossed from arizona to  speed  mach 20.9  altitude  219,000 feet  67km  41.5mi  8 57 24  ei 795  columbia passed just north of  8 58 00  ei 831  at this point wing leading-edge temperatures typically decreased to 2,880f  1,580c  8 58 20  ei 851  columbia crossed from new mexico into texas speed  mach 19.5  altitude  209,800 feet  63.9km  39.73mi  

at about this time the orbiter shed a thermal protection system tile the most westerly piece of debris that has been recovered searchers found the tile in a field in  just northwest of  

8 59 15  ei 906  mmacs told the flight director that pressure readings had been lost on both left main landing-gear tires the flight director then instructed the capsule communicator  capcom  to let the crew know that mission control saw the messages and was evaluating the indications and added that the flight control team did not understand the crew s last transmission 8 59 32  ei 923  a broken response from the mission commander was recorded   roger uh bu   cut off in mid-word    it was the last communication from the crew and the last  signal received in mission control 8 59 37  ei 928  hydraulic pressure which is required to move the flight control surfaces was lost at about 8 59 37 at that time the master alarm would have sounded for the loss of hydraulics and the shuttle would have begun to lose control starting to roll and yaw uncontrollably and the crew would have become aware of the serious problem 9 00 18  ei 969  videos and eyewitness reports by observers on the ground in and near  indicated that the orbiter had disintegrated overhead continued to break up into smaller pieces and left multiple ion trails as it continued eastward in mission control while the loss of signal was a cause for concern there was no sign of any serious problem before the orbiter broke up at 9 00 18 the columbia cabin pressure was nominal and the crew was capable of conscious actions although the crew module remained mostly intact through the breakup it was damaged enough that it lost pressure at a rate fast enough to incapacitate the crew within seconds and was completely depressurized no later than 9 00 53 9 00 57  ei 1008  the crew module intact to this point was seen breaking into small subcomponents it disappeared from view at 9 01 10 the crew if not already dead were killed no later than this point 9 05  residents of north central texas particularly near  reported a loud boom a small concussion wave smoke trails and debris in the clear skies above the counties east of dallas 9 12 39  ei 1710  after hearing of reports of the shuttle being seen to break apart entry flight director leroy cain declared a contingency  events leading to loss of the vehicle  and alerted search-and-rescue teams in the debris area he called on the  to  lock the doors  meaning no one would be permitted to enter or leave until everything needed for investigation of the accident had been secured two minutes later mission control put contingency procedures into effect 
crew survivability aspects 
in 2008 nasa released a detailed report on survivability aspects of the columbia reentry the crew would have had less than a minute between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization the structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin although they had no way of knowing that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin all evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of columbia as it began to spin out of control but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration the crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds afterwards the cabin spun around at high rpm which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail they were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets which were not designed to provide any head protection even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death after cabin disintegration the astronauts  bodies were released into the upper atmosphere and battered by extreme aerodynamic forces  close to 14,000 mph  and temperatures the remains of the crew then fell some 200,000 feet to earth where they were also subjected to burning from aerodynamic heating the official nasa report omitted some of the more graphic details on the recovery of the remains however witnesses reported various gruesome finds such as a human heart and parts of femur bones all evidence indicated that crew error was in no way responsible for the disintegration of the orbiter and they had acted correctly and according to procedure at the first indication of trouble although some of the crew were not wearing gloves or helmets during reentry and some were not properly restrained in their seats doing these things would have added nothing to their survival chances other than perhaps keeping them alive and conscious another 30 or so seconds presidential response

mock-up of a  leading edge made with anpanel taken from  simulation of known and possible conditions of the foam impact on  s final launch showed  of rcc 

nasa space shuttle program manager  reported that  the first indication was loss of temperature sensors and hydraulic systems on the left wing they were followed seconds and minutes later by several other problems including loss of tire pressure indications on the left main gear and then indications of excessive structural heating  analysis of 31 seconds of telemetry data which had initially been filtered out because of data corruption within it showed the shuttle fighting to maintain its orientation eventually using maximum thrust from its reaction control system jets the investigation focused on the foam strike from the very beginning incidents of debris strikes from ice and foam causing damage during take-off were already well known and had damaged orbiters most noticeably during   and  after the loss of columbia nasa concluded that mistakes during installation were the likely cause of foam loss and retrained employees at  in louisiana to apply foam without defects tile damage had also been traced to ablating insulating material from the  fuel tank in the past the composition of the foam insulation had been changed in 1997 to exclude the use of  a chemical that is suspected to cause   while nasa was exempted from legislation phasing out cfcs the agency chose to change the foam nonetheless sts-107 used an older  lightweight tank   a design that was succeeded by the  superlightweight tank  both being upgrades from the original space shuttle external tank  where the foam was sprayed on to the larger cylindrical surfaces using the newer freon-free foam however the bipod ramps were manufactured from bx-250 foam which was excluded from the epa regulations and did use the original freon formula the composition change did not contribute to the accident in any case the original formulation had shown frequent foam losses as discussed earlier in this article columbia accident investigation board 
main article  
following protocols established after the  of  an independent investigating board was created immediately after the accident the columbia accident investigation board or caib was chaired by retired us navy admiral  and consisted of expert military and civilian analysts who investigated the accident in detail columbia s  was found near  on march 19 2003 unlike commercial jet aircraft the space shuttles did not have flight data recorders intended for after-crash analysis instead the vehicle data were transmitted in real time to the ground via  since columbia was the first shuttle it had a special flight data oex  orbiter experiments  recorder designed to help engineers better understand vehicle performance during the first test flights after the initial shuttle test-flights were completed the recorder was never removed from columbia and it was still functioning on the crashed flight it recorded many hundreds of parameters and contained very extensive logs of structural and other data which allowed the caib to reconstruct many of the events during the process leading to breakup investigators could often use the loss of signals from sensors on the wing to track how the damage progressed this was correlated with forensic debris analysis conducted at  and other tests to obtain a final conclusion about the probable course of events beginning on may 30 2003 foam impact tests were performed by  they used a compressed air gun to fire a foam block of similar size and mass to that which struck columbia at the same estimated speed to represent the leading edge of columbia s left wing  panels from nasa stock along with the actual leading-edge panels from  which were fiberglass were mounted to a simulating structural metal frame at the beginning of testing the likely impact site was estimated to be between rcc panel 6 and 9 inclusive over many days dozens of the foam blocks were shot at the wing leading edge model at various angles these produced only cracks or surface damage to the rcc panels during june further analysis of information from columbia s flight data recorder narrowed the probable impact site to one single panel  rcc wing panel 8 on july 7 in a final round of testing a block fired at the side of an rcc panel 8 created a hole 16 by 16.7 inches  41 by 42cm  in that protective rcc panel the tests demonstrated that a foam impact of the type columbia sustained could seriously breach the thermal protection system on the wing leading edge conclusions 
on august 26 2003 the caib issued its report on the accident the report confirmed the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in the leading edge of the left wing caused by insulating foam shed during launch the report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident the report was highly critical of nasa s decision-making and risk-assessment processes it concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions an example was the position of shuttle program manager where one individual was responsible for achieving safe timely launches and acceptable costs which are often conflicting goals the caib report found that nasa had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences one of those was the conflict between a  stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight the board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture on december 30 2008 nasa released a further report entitled columbia crew survival investigation report produced by a second commission the spacecraft crew survival integrated investigation team  scsiit  nasa had commissioned this group  to perform a comprehensive analysis of the accident focusing on factors and events affecting crew survival and to develop recommendations for improving crew survival for all future human space flight vehicles  the report concluded that   the columbia depressurization event occurred so rapidly that the crew members were incapacitated within seconds before they could configure the suit for full protection from loss of cabin pressure although circulatory systems functioned for a brief time the effects of the depressurization were severe enough that the crew could not have regained consciousness this event was lethal to the crew 
the report also concluded 

the crew did not have time to prepare themselves some crew members were not wearing their safety gloves and one crew member was not wearing a helmet new policies gave the crew more time to prepare for descent the crew s safety harnesses malfunctioned during the violent descent the harnesses on the three remaining shuttles were upgraded after the accident 
the key recommendations of the report included that future spacecraft crew survival systems should not rely on manual activation to protect the crew possible emergency procedures 
one question of special importance was whether nasa could have saved the astronauts had they known of the danger this would have to involve either rescue or repair  docking at the  for use as a haven while awaiting rescue  or to use the  to systematically ferry the crew to safety  would have been impossible due to the different  of the vehicles the caib determined that a rescue mission though risky might have been possible provided nasa management had taken action soon enough normally a rescue mission is not possible due to the time required to prepare a shuttle for launch and the limited consumables  power water air  of an orbiting shuttle however atlantis was well along in processing for a planned march 1 launch on  and columbia carried an unusually large quantity of consumables due to an  package the caib determined that this would have allowed columbia to stay in orbit until flight day 30  february 15  nasa investigators determined that atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a february 10 launch hence if nothing went wrong there was a five-day overlap for a possible rescue as mission control could deorbit an empty shuttle but could not control the orbiter s reentry and landing it would likely have sent columbia into the pacific ocean  nasa later developed the  system to permit mission control to land a shuttle nasa investigators determined that on-orbit repair by the shuttle astronauts was possible but overall considered  high risk  primarily due to the uncertain resiliency of the repair using available materials and the anticipated high risk of doing additional damage to the orbiter columbia did not carry the  or remote manipulator system which would normally be used for camera inspection or transporting a spacewalking astronaut to the wing therefore an unusual emergency   eva  would have been required while there was no astronaut eva training for maneuvering to the wing astronauts are always prepared for a similarly difficult emergency eva to close the external tank umbilical doors located on the orbiter underside which is necessary for reentry similar methods could have reached the shuttle left wing for inspection or repair for the repair the caib determined that the astronauts would have to use tools and small pieces of titanium or other metal scavenged from the crew cabin these metals would help protect the wing structure and would be held in place during re-entry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in the cold of space the ice and metal would help restore wing leading edge geometry preventing a turbulent airflow over the wing and therefore keeping heating and burn-through levels low enough for the crew to survive re-entry and bail out before landing the caib could not determine whether a patched-up left wing would have survived even a modified re-entry and concluded that the rescue option would have had a considerably higher chance of bringing columbia s crew back alive memorials

after the shuttle s breakup there were some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved but no evidence of that has ever surfaced security surrounding the launch and landing of the space shuttle had been increased because the crew included the first israeli astronaut the  launch facility like all sensitive government areas had increased security after the  purple streak image
