theories concerning infrequency of occurrence 
until april 1991 it was thought that tropical cyclones did not develop within the south atlantic very strong vertical wind shear in the  is considered a deterrent the  drops one to two degrees south of the equator not far enough from the equator for the  to aid development water temperatures in the tropics of the southern atlantic are cooler than those in the tropical north atlantic during april 1991 these assertions were proven false when the united states  reported that a tropical cyclone had developed over the eastern south atlantic in subsequent years a few systems were suspected to have the characteristics needed to be classified as a tropical cyclone including in march 1994 and january 2004 during march 2004 an  formally transitioned into a tropical cyclone and made landfall on brazil after becoming a category 2 hurricane on the  while the system was threatening the brazilian state of  a newspaper used the headline  furaco catarina  which was originally presumed to mean  furaco  hurricane  threatening  santa  catarina  the state  after international presses started monitoring the system  hurricane catarina  has formally been adopted at the sixth wmo international workshop on tropical cyclones  iwtc-vi  in 2006 it was questioned if any subtropical or tropical cyclones had developed within the south atlantic before catarina it was noted that suspect systems had developed in january 1970 march 1994 january 2004 march 2004 may 2004 february 2006 and march 2006 it was also suggested that an effort should be made to locate any possible systems using satellite imagery and synoptic data  however it was noted that this effort may be hindered by the lack of any geostationary imagery over the basin before 1966 a study was subsequently performed and published during 2012 which concluded that there had been 63 subtropical cyclones in the southern atlantic between 1957 and 2007 during january 2009 a subtropical storm developed in the basin and in march 2010 a tropical storm developed which was named anita by the brazilian public and private weather services in 2011 the  started to assign  to tropical and subtropical cyclones that develop within its area of responsibility to the west of 20w when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 65km h  40mph  known storms and impacts

a low pressure area formed over the  on april 9 the next day it moved offshore northern  with a curved cloud pattern it moved westward over an area of warm waters and caused minor damages on  while the circulation became better defined according to the united states  the system was probably either a tropical depression or a tropical storm at its peak intensity on april 14 the system rapidly dissipated as it was absorbed into a large  
hurricane catarina 

main article  
hurricane catarina was an extraordinarily rare tropical cyclone forming in the southern  in march 2004 just after becoming a hurricane it hit the southern coast of  in the state of  on the evening of march 28 with winds estimated near 155 kilometres per hour  96mph  making it a category 2-equivalent on the  the cyclone killed 3 to 10 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in brazil at the time the brazilians were taken completely by surprise and were initially skeptical that an actual tropical cyclone could have formed in the south atlantic eventually however they were convinced and adopted the previously-unofficial name  catarina  for the storm after santa catarina state this event is considered by some  to be a nearly once-in-a-lifetime occurrence 
tropical storm anita 

on march8 2010 a previously extratropical cyclone developed tropical characteristics and was classified as a subtropical cyclone off the coast of southern brazil the following day the  began monitoring the system as a system of interest under the designation of 90q the  also began monitoring the system as low sl90 during the afternoon of march 9 the system had attained an intensity of 55km h  35mph  and a  of 1000hpa  mbar  it was declared a tropical storm on march 10 and became extratropical late on march 12 anita s  was estimated at 2.0525 by the florida state university there was no damage associated to the storm except high sea in the coasts of rio grande do sul and santa catarina post mortem the cyclone was given the name  anita  by private and public weather centers in southern brazil 
subtropical storm arani 

early on march 14 2011 the navy hydrographic center  smm  in coordination with the national institute of meteorology were monitoring an organizing area of  near the southeast coast of brazil later that day a  developed just east of   and by 1200 the system organized into a  located about 140km  90mi  east of  guided by a  and a weak  to its north the system moved slowly southeastward over an area of warm waters intensifying into subtropical cyclone arani on march 15 as named by the brazilian navy hydrographic center the storm was classified as subtropical as the convection was east of the center on march 16 arani began experiencing 25 knots of wind shear because another frontal system bumped it from behind before it developed into a subtropical cyclone arani produced torrential rains over portions of southeastern  resulting in flash flooding and landslides significant damage was reported in portions of  though specifics are unknown increased swells along the coast prompted ocean travel warnings 
subtropical storm bapo 

during february 5 2015 a subtropical depression developed about 105mi  170km  to the southeast of   over the next day low-level  decreased around the system as it moved south-eastwards away from the brazilian coast and intensified further the system was named bapo by the brazilian navy hydrography center during february 6 after it had intensified into a subtropical storm over the next couple of days the system continued to move south-eastwards before it transitioned into an  during february 8 
subtropical storm cari 

on march 10 2015 the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy began issuing warnings of subtropical depression 3 during early afternoon while cptec already assigned the name cari for the storm at 0000 utc on march 11 the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy upgraded cari to a subtropical storm also assigning a name to it on march 12 the brazilian hydrographic center downgraded cari to a subtropical depression while the cptec stated that the storm became a  hybrid cyclone  during early afternoon of march 13 the brazilian navy declared that cari became a remnant low cari brought heavy rainfall flooding and landslides to eastern cities of  and  states rain totals from 100mm to 180mm were observed associated with the storms and wind topped 75km h  45mph  in  a navy buoy registered a 20-ft wave off the coast of santa catarina 
subtropical storm deni 

a subtropical depression formed southwest of  on november 15 2016 it intensified into a subtropical storm and received the name deni on november 16 moving south-southeastwards deni soon became extratropical shortly before 00 00 utc on november 17 
subtropical storm ea 

an extratropical cyclone entered the ocean from  early on december 4 2016 later it intensified quickly and then transitioned into a subtropical storm shortly before 22 00   00 00 utc on december 5  with the name ea assigned by the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy ea started to decay on december 5 and weakened into a subtropical depression at around 00 00 utc on december 6

modis visible satellite imagery a possible january 2004 tropical cyclone


according to a presentation at the sixth wmo international workshop on tropical cyclones  iwtc-vi  satellite imagery from january 1970 showed that a system with an eyewall had developed behind a cold front and that the system needed further analysis to determine if it was tropical or subtropical on march 27 1974 a weak area of low pressure that had originated over the amazon river started to intensify further over the next 48 hours the system quickly developed further and was classified as subtropical as it developed a banding structure and deep convection near its warm core on march 29 a north-westerly flow encroached on the systems environment which caused the system to rapidly move towards 40s and the cold waters that were present to the south of 40s in march 1994 a system that was thought to be weaker than catarina was spawned but was located over cool and open waters 20042009 
during 2004 the large-scale conditions over the south atlantic were more conducive than usual for subtropical or tropical systems with 4 systems noted the first possible tropical cyclone developed within a trough of low pressure to the southeast of salvador brazil on january 18 the system subsequently displayed a small central dense overcast and was suspected to be at the peak of its development as either a tropical depression or a tropical storm during the next day the system was subsequently affected by some strong shear before it moved inland and weakened along the coast of brazil before it was last noted during january 21 within brazil the system caused heavy rain and flooding with a state of emergency declared in  after the river overflowed and burst its banks which flooded homes destroyed crops and caused parts of the highway to collapse however it was noted that not all of the heavy rain and impacts were attributable to the system as a large monsoon low covered much of brazil at the time the second system was a possible hybrid cyclone that developed near south-eastern brazil between march 1516 hurricane catarina was the third system while the fourth system had a well-defined eye like structure and formed off the coast of brazil during on march 15 2004 



modis visible satellite image of a possible february 2006 tropical storm


on february 22 2006 a baroclinic cyclone intensified quickly and was estimated to have peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 65mph  100km h  after radar data showed that the system had developed an eye and banding however there were questions about how tropical the system was as it did not separate from the westerlies or the baroclinic zone it was in between march 1117 2006 a system with a warm core developed and moved southwards along the south atlantic zone two subtropical cyclones affected both  and  state in  on january 28 2009 a cold-core mid to upper-level  in phase with a low-level warm-core  formed a  and moved eastward into the  the storm produced rainfall in 24 hours of 300mm or more in some locations of   uruguay  and southern rio grande do sul the weather station owned by metsul weather center in  southern brazil recorded 278.2mm in a 24-hour period fourteen deaths and thousands of evacuees are attributed to the storm with an emergency declared in four cities it lasted until february 1 when the cyclone became extratropical 20102016 




subtropical storm in november 2010


on november 16 2010 a cold-core mid to upper-level  in phase with a low-level warm-core  formed a  state in  and moved southeastward into the  where it slightly deepened the system brought locally heavy rains in southern brazil and northeast of uruguay that exceeded 200 millimeters in a few hours in some locations of southern rio grande do sul northwest of pelotas damages and flooding were observed in cerrito so loureno do sul and pedro osrio baado de pajas departament of cerro largo in uruguay recorded 240mm of rain the subtropical cyclone then became a weak trough on november 19 according to the cptec between december 23 2013 and january 24 2015 the center for weather forecast and climatic studies  cptec  and navy hydrography center monitored four subtropical depressions to the south of  the first one lasted until  2013 two subtropical depressions formed in 2014  one in late-february 2014 and the other in late-march 2014 a fourth one formed in late january 2015 on january 5 2016 the hydrographic center of the brazilian navy issued warnings on a subtropical depression that formed east of   on the next day the system strengthened into a tropical depression and other agencies considered it as an invest designating it as 90q  however on january 7 the tropical depression dissipated storm names 
the following names are published by the  and used for named storms that form in the area west of  and south of equator in the south atlantic ocean since 2011 arani is confirmed to be used again in the future after its next nine names are all used but it is unclear if those names will be also rotated 
listed by month 
there have over 25 recorded tropical and subtropical cyclones in the south atlantic ocean since 1974 like most southern hemisphere cyclone seasons all storms have formed from november to april
