the main ways water vapour is added to the air are  wind convergence into areas of upward motion precipitation or virga falling from above daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land transpiration from plants cool or dry air moving over warmer water and lifting air over mountains formation

convective precipitation


 or showery precipitation occurs from convective clouds e.g  or  it falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent most precipitation in the  appears to be convective  however it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs  and  indicate convection in mid-latitudes convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as   and warm fronts orographic effects

orographic precipitation


orographic precipitation occurs on the  side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge resulting in  cooling and condensation in mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds  for example the   a more moist  usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the  or downwind side moisture is removed by orographic lift leaving drier air  see   on the descending and generally warming leeward side where a  is observed in   on the island of kauai is notable for its extreme rainfall as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on earth with 12,000 millimetres  460in  storm systems affect the state with heavy rains between october and march local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography divisible into windward  koolau  and leeward  kona  regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains windward sides face the east to northeast  and receive much more rainfall  leeward sides are drier and sunnier with less rain and less cloud cover in south america the  mountain range blocks pacific moisture that arrives in that continent resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western argentina the  range creates the same effect in north america forming the  and  similarly in asia the  create an obstacle to monsoons which leads to extremely high precipitation on the southern side and lower precipitation levels on the northern side snow

standard rain gauge


the standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge which can be found in 100mm  4in  plastic and 200mm  8in  metal varieties the inner cylinder is filled by 25mm  1in  of rain with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25mm  0.01in  resolution while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25mm  0.01in  markings after the inner cylinder is filled the amount inside it is discarded then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty these gauges are used in the winter by removing the funnel and inner cylinder and allowing snow and freezing rain to collect inside the outer cylinder some add anti-freeze to their gauge so they do not have to melt the snow or ice that falls into the gauge once the snowfall ice is finished accumulating or as 300mm  12in  is approached one can either bring it inside to melt or use lukewarm water to fill the inner cylinder with in order to melt the frozen precipitation in the outer cylinder keeping track of the warm fluid added which is subsequently subtracted from the overall total once all the ice snow is melted other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge  the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile  the tipping bucket rain gauge and the weighing rain gauge the wedge and tipping bucket gauges will have problems with snow attempts to compensate for snow ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited success since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above freezing weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow but again the funnel needs to be removed before the event begins for those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with any of the above rain gauges can be made at home with enough know-how when a precipitation measurement is made various networks exist across the united states and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the internet such as  or globe if a network is not available in the area where one lives the nearest local weather office will likely be interested in the measurement hydrometeor definition 
a concept used in precipitation measurement is the hydrometeor bits of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors formations due to condensation such as clouds  fog and mist are composed of hydrometeors all precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition including virga which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground particles blown from the earth s surface by wind such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray are also hydrometeors satellite estimates 
although surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation there are many areas in which their use is not feasible this includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas in other cases social technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations as a result the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations satellite sensors work by remotely sensing precipitationrecording various parts of the  that theory and practice show are related to the occurrence and intensity of precipitation the sensors are almost exclusively passive recording what they see similar to a camera in contrast to active sensors     that send out a signal and detect its impact on the area being observed satellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories thermal infrared   sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops due to the typical structure of the atmosphere cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes further cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds various mathematical schemes or algorithms use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the ir data the second category of sensor channels is in the  part of the electromagnetic spectrum the frequencies in use range from about 10 gigahertz to a few hundred ghz channels up to about 37ghz primarily provide information on the liquid hydrometeors  rain and drizzle  in the lower parts of clouds with larger amounts of liquid emitting higher amounts of microwave radiant energy channels above 37ghz display emission signals but are dominated by the action of solid hydrometeors  snow graupel etc  to scatter microwave radiant energy satellites such as the   trmm  and the   gpm  mission employ microwave sensors to form precipitation estimates additional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels additional ir channels water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals however most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources 
satellite data sets 
the ir estimates have rather low skill at short time and space scales but are available very frequently  15 minutes or more often  from satellites in  earth orbit ir works best in cases of deep vigorous convectionsuch as the tropicsand becomes progressively less useful in areas where stratiform  layered  precipitation dominates especially in mid and high-latitude regions the more-direct physical connection between hydrometeors and microwave channels gives the microwave estimates greater skill on short time and space scales than is true for ir however microwave sensors fly only on low earth orbit satellites and there are few enough of them that the average time between observations exceeds three hours this several-hour interval is insufficient to adequately document precipitation because of the transient nature of most precipitation systems as well as the inability of a single satellite to appropriately capture the typical daily cycle of precipitation at a given location since the late 1990s several algorithms have been developed to combine precipitation data from multiple satellites  sensors seeking to emphasize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets the goal is to provide  best  estimates of precipitation on a uniform time space grid usually for as much of the globe as possible in some cases the long-term homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized which is the  standard in other cases the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite estimate which is the high resolution precipitation product approach in either case of course the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable one key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates the difficulties in using gauge data are that 1  their availability is limited as noted above and 2  the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission assembly processing and quality control thus precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates as a result while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the  true  precipitation they are generally not suited for real or near-real-time applications the work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different formats time space grids periods of record and regions of coverage input datasets and analysis procedures as well as many different forms of dataset version designators in many cases one of the modern multi-satellite data sets is the best choice for general use return period
