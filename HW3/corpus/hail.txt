a large hailstone about 6cm  2.4in  in diameter



hail is a form of solid  it is distinct from   american sleet  though the two are often confused it consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice each of which is called a hailstone ice pellets  american sleet  falls generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface temperatures unlike other forms of  such as  which is made of  and  which are smaller and  hailstones usually measure between 5 millimetres  0.2in  and 15 centimetres  6in  in diameter the  reporting code for hail 5mm  0.20in  or greater is gr while smaller hailstones and graupel are coded gs hail is possible within most  as it is produced by  and within 2 nautical miles  3.7km  of the parent storm hail formation requires environments of strong upward motion of air with the parent thunderstorm  similar to   and lowered heights of the freezing level in the  hail forms near the  while in the  it tends to be confined to high  there are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms using  and  imagery hailstones generally fall at higher speeds as they grow in size though complicating factors such as melting friction with air wind and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent through  severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a damaging size as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures and most commonly farmers  crops

definition 
any thunderstorm which produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres  0.20in  or more hailstones can grow to 15 centimetres  6in  and weigh more than 0.5 kilograms  1.1lb  unlike ice pellets hailstones are layered and can be irregular and clumped together hail is composed of transparent ice or alternating layers of transparent and translucent ice at least 1 millimetre  0.039in  thick which are deposited upon the hailstone as it travels through the cloud suspended aloft by air with strong upward motion until its weight overcomes the  and falls to the ground although the diameter of hail is varied in the united states the average observation of damaging hail is between 2.5cm  1in  andsized  1.75in  stones larger than 2cm  0.80in  are usually considered large enough to cause damage the  issues severe thunderstorm warnings when hail that size or above is expected the us  has a 2.5cm  1in  or greater in diameter threshold effective january 2010 an increase over the previous threshold ofinch hail other countries have different thresholds according local sensitivity to hail  for instance grape growing areas could be adversely impacted by smaller hailstones hailstones can be very large or very small depending on how strong the updraft is  weaker hailstorms produce smaller hailstones than stronger hailstorms  such as   formation 
hail forms in strong  clouds particularly those with intense  high liquid water content great vertical extent large water droplets and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0c  32f  these types of strong updrafts can also indicate the presence of a tornado the growth rate is maximized where air is near a temperature of 13c  9f

like other precipitation in cumulonimbus clouds hail begins as water droplets as the droplets rise and the temperature goes below freezing they become   and will freeze on contact with  a cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure this means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers alternating with layers that are thin white and opaque former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted this up and down motion was thought to be responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone new research based on theory as well as field study has shown this is not necessarily true the storm s  with upwardly directed wind speeds as high as 110 miles per hour  180km h  blows the forming hailstones up the cloud as the hailstone ascends it passes into areas of the cloud where the concentration of humidity and supercooled water droplets varies the hailstones growth rate changes depending on the variation in humidity and supercooled water droplets that it encounters the accretion rate of these water droplets is another factor in the hailstones growth when the hailstone moves into an area with a high concentration of water droplets it captures the latter and acquires a translucent layer should the hailstone move into an area where mostly water vapour is available it acquires a layer of opaque white ice furthermore the hailstones speed depends on its position in the clouds updraft and its mass this determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the hailstone the accretion rate of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstone depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the hailstone itself this means that generally the larger hailstones will form some distance from the stronger updraft where they can pass more time growing as the hailstone grows it releases  which keeps its exterior in a liquid phase because it undergoes  wet growth  the outer layer is sticky  i.e more adhesive  so a single hailstone may grow by collision with other smaller hailstones forming a larger entity with an irregular shape the hailstone will keep rising in the thunderstorm until its mass can no longer be supported by the updraft this may take at least 30 minutes based on the force of the updrafts in the hail-producing thunderstorm whose top is usually greater than 10km high it then falls toward the ground while continuing to grow based on the same processes until it leaves the cloud it will later begin to melt as it passes into air above freezing temperature thus a unique trajectory in the thunderstorm is sufficient to explain the layer-like structure of the hailstone the only case in which multiple trajectories can be discussed is in a multicellular thunderstorm where the hailstone may be ejected from the top of the  mother  cell and captured in the updraft of a more intense  daughter  cell this however is an exceptional case factors favoring hail 
hail is most common within continental interiors of the mid-latitudes as hail formation is considerably more likely when the freezing level is below the altitude of 11,000 feet  3,400m   of dry air into strong thunderstorms over continents can increase the frequency of hail by promoting evaporational cooling which lowers the freezing level of thunderstorm clouds giving hail a larger volume to grow in accordingly hail is less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater altitude hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations hail growth becomes vanishingly small when air temperatures fall below 30c  22f  as supercooled water droplets become rare at these temperatures around thunderstorms hail is most likely within the cloud at elevations above 20,000 feet  6,100m  between 10,000 feet  3,000m  and 20,000 feet  6,100m  60percent of hail is still within the thunderstorm though 40percent now lies within the clear air under the anvil below 10,000 feet  3,000m  hail is equally distributed in and around a thunderstorm to a distance of 2 nautical miles  3.7km  climatology 
hail occurs most frequently within continental interiors at mid-latitudes and is less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes hail is also much more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards  known as   thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely the higher elevations also result in there being less time available for hail to melt before reaching the ground one of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern  which reported one of the highest hail-related death tolls on record in 1888  also experiences significant hailstorms central europe and southern australia also experience a lot of hailstorms popular regions for hailstorms are southern and western  northern and eastern  and southern and eastern  in south-eastern europe  and  experience frequent occurrences of hail in  hail is most common in the area where   and  meet known as  hail alley  hail in this region occurs between the months of march and october during the afternoon and evening hours with the bulk of the occurrences from may through september  is north america s most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season to the north of this area and also just downwind of the rocky mountains is the  region of  which also experiences an increased incidence of significant hail events short-term detection

 is a very useful tool to detect the presence of hail-producing thunderstorms however radar data has to be complemented by a knowledge of current atmospheric conditions which can allow one to determine if the current atmosphere is conducive to hail development modern radar scans many angles around the site reflectivity values at multiple angles above ground level in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels summing reflectivities in the  or vil gives the  in the cloud research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm is related to the evolution of vil vil divided by the vertical extent of the storm called vil density has a relationship with hail size although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate traditionally hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground certain patterns of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well the  is an example this is the result of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar the energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path forming a cone of weaker reflectivities more recently the  properties of weather radar returns have been analyzed to differentiate between hail and heavy rain the use of differential reflectivity   in combination with horizontal reflectivity   has led to a variety of hail classification algorithms visible satellite imagery is beginning to be used to detect hail but false alarm rates remain high using this method size and terminal velocity 




hailstones ranging in size from few millimetres to over a centimetre in diameter

the size of hailstones is best determined by measuring their diameter with a ruler in the absence of a ruler hailstone size is often visually estimated by comparing its size to that of known objects such as coins using the objects such as hen s eggs peas and marbles for comparing hailstone sizes is imprecise due to their varied dimensions the uk organisation  also scales for both hailstones and hailstorms when observed at an   code is used within a  which relates to the size of the hailstone within metar code gr is used to indicate larger hail of a diameter of at least 0.25 inches  6.4mm  gr is derived from the french word grle smaller-sized hail as well as snow pellets use the coding of gs which is short for the french word grsil

hail records 
 large rocks of ice that are not associated with thunderstorms are not officially recognized by the  as  hail  which are aggregations of ice associated with thunderstorms and therefore records of extreme characteristics of megacryometeors are not given as hail records

 of hail or the speed at which hail is falling when it strikes the ground varies it is estimated that a hailstone of 1 centimetre  0.39in  in diameter falls at a rate of 9 metres per second  20mph  while stones the size of 8 centimetres  3.1in  in diameter fall at a rate of 48 metres per second  110mph  hailstone velocity is dependent on the size of the stone friction with air it is falling through the motion of  it is falling through collisions with raindrops or other hailstones and melting as the stones fall through a warmer  as hail stones are not perfect spheres it is difficult to calculate their speed accurately hazards

hail can cause serious damage notably to  aircraft skylights glass-roofed structures  and most commonly farmers   hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen such as leaks or cracks it is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings hail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft when hailstones exceed 0.5 inches  13mm  in diameter planes can be seriously damaged within seconds the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering  and  wheat corn soybeans and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage hail is one of canada s most expensive hazards rarely massive hailstones have been known to cause  or fatal head  hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history one of the earliest known incidents occurred around the 9th century in    where 200 to 600 nomads seem to have died of injuries from hail the size of cricket balls the largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the  fell on july 23 2010 in   it measured 8 inches  20cm  in diameter and 18.62 inches  47.3cm  in circumference weighing in at 1.93 pounds  0.88kg  this broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7inches diameter and 18.74inches circumference  still the greatest circumference hailstone  which fell in  in the united states on june 22 2003 as well as the record for weight set by a hailstone of 1.67 pounds  0.76kg  that fell in  in 1970 accumulations 




accumulated hail after a storm in 


narrow zones where hail accumulates on the ground in association with thunderstorm activity are known as hail streaks or hail swaths which can be detectable by satellite after the storms pass by hailstorms normally last from a few minutes up to 15 minutes in duration accumulating hail storms can blanket the ground with over 2 inches  5.1cm  of hail cause thousands to lose power and bring down many trees flash flooding and mudslides within areas of steep terrain can be a concern with accumulating hail depths of up to 18in  0.46m  have been reported a landscape covered in accumulated hail generally resembles one covered in accumulated snow and any significant accumulation of hail has the same restrictive effects as snow accumulation albeit over a smaller area on transport and infrastructure accumulated hail can also cause flooding by blocking drains and hail can be carried in the floodwater turning into a snow-like slush which is deposited at lower elevations on somewhat rare occasions a thunderstorm can become stationary or nearly so while prolifically producing hail and significant depths of accumulation do occur  this tends to happen in mountainous areas such as the july 29 2010 case of a foot of hail accumulation in  colorado on june 5 2015 hail up to four feet deep fell on one city block in  the hailstones described as between the size of bumble bees and ping pong balls were accompanied by rain and high winds the hail fell in only the one area leaving the surrounding area untouched it fell for one and a half hours between 10 p.m and 11 30p.m a meteorologist for the national weather service in boulder said  it s a very interesting phenomenon we saw the storm stall it produced copious amounts of hail in one small area it s a meteorological thing  tractors used to clear the area filled more than 30 dump-truck loads of hail research focused on four individual days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches  15cm  of hail in 30 minutes on the colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather radar and lightning characteristics suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence a fundamental problem in continuing research in this area is that unlike hail diameter hail depth is not commonly reported the lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods a cooperative effort between the university of colorado and the national weather service is in progress the joint project s goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths suppression and prevention
