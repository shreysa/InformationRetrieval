an anomaly in space-time characteristics of certain programs running in a paging machine the running time of programs in a paging machine generally increases as the store in which programs are constrained to run decreases Experiments, however have revealed cases in which the reverse is true a decrease in the size of the store is accompanied by a decrease in running time an informal discussion of the anomalous behavior is given and for the case of the fifo replacement algorithm a formal treatment is presented cacm June, 1969 Belady, L.
