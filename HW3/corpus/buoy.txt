  used to mark dive sites for the boat safety cover of scuba divers so that the divers can descend to the dive site more easily in conditions of low visibility or  and more safely do  on their ascent  or   a navigational buoy which marks the entrance to a channel or a nearby landfall
  emergency wreck buoys provide a clear and unambiguous means of marking new wrecks this buoy is used as a temporary response typically for the first 2472 hours this buoy is coloured in an equal number of blue and yellow vertical stripes and is fitted with an alternating blue and yellow flashing light this has come about due to the collisions which occurred in the dover straits in 2002 when vessels struck the new wreck of the   buoy
mooring buoys  used to keep one end of a  cable or chain on the water s surface so that  or boats can tie on to it
tripping buoys  used to keep one end of a  tripping line  on the water s surface so that a stuck  can more easily be freed
  equipped to measure weather parameters such as air temperature barometric pressure wind speed and direction and to report these data via satellite radio links such as the purpose-built  or commercial  networks to meteorological centres for use in forecasting and climate study may be anchored  moored buoys  or allowed to drift  drifting buoys  in the open ocean currents position is calculated by the satellite weather buoys are sometimes referred to as  buoys or  and may be marked on charts as  superbuoys 
  anchored buoys that can detect sudden changes in undersea water pressure are used as part of  in the  and indian oceans   a tall thin buoy that floats upright in the water e.g  profiling buoy  specialized models which adjust buoyancy so that they will sink at a controlled rate to 2,000 metres below the surface while measuring sea temperatures and salinity after a time typically 10 days the buoy returns to the surface transmits its data via satellite and then sinks again see  ice marking buoys  used for marking ice holes in frozen lakes and rivers so that snowmobiles do not drive over the holes marker buoys  used in  particularly  is a light-emitting or smoke-emitting or both marker using some kind of  to provide the  and  it is commonly a 3-inch  76mm  diameter device about 20inches  500mm  long that is set off by contact with seawater and floats on the surface some markers extinguish after a set period and others are made to sink lobster trap buoys  brightly colored buoys used for the marking of lobster trap locations so the person  can find their lobster traps each lobster fisherman has his or her own color markings or registration numbers so they know which ones are theirs they are only allowed to haul their own traps and must display their buoy color or license number on their boat so law enforcement officials know what they should be hauling the buoys are brightly colored with highly visible numbers so they can be seen under conditions when there is poor visibility like    etc   used to measure the movement of the water surface as a wave train the wave train is analysed to determine statistics like the  and period and wave direction target buoy  used to simulate target  like small boat  in live fire exercise by naval and coastal forces usually targeted by weapons  medium size  like hmg s rapid fire cannons  20 or so mm  autocannons  bigger ones up to 40 and 57mm  and also anti-tank rockets wreck buoy  a buoy to mark a wrecked ship to warn other ships to keep away because of unseen hazards   sldmb   a 70 scale coastal ocean dynamics experiment  code davis-style oceanographic surface drifter with drogue vanes between 30 and 100cm deep this particular surface drifter is designed specifically for deployment from a  vessel or airframe for search and rescue since the sldmb has a very small surface area above the ocean surface and a high underwater surface area there is very little  in response to the direct forcing of winds and waves the space buoy is a common element in science fiction that refers to a stationary object in  that provides navigation data or warnings about that particular area buoy racing is the most prevalent form of
