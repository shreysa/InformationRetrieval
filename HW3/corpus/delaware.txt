new sweden  encounter between swedish colonists and the natives of delaware 

the  were the first europeans to settle in present-day delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at  near the site of  in 1631 within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with  in 1638  a  trading post and colony was established at   now in   by  at the head of a group of swedes  and dutch the colony of new sweden lasted for 17 years in 1651 the dutch reinvigorated by the leadership of  established a fort at present-day  and in 1655 they conquered the new sweden colony annexing it into the dutch  only nine years later in 1664 the dutch were conquered by a fleet of english ships by sir robert carr under the direction of  fighting off a prior claim by   the duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to  in 1682 penn strongly desired access to the sea for his  and leased what then came to be known as the  lower counties on the delaware  from the duke penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one general assembly in 1682 however by 1704 the province of pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the lower counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own one at  and the other at new castle penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person governor for their province of pennsylvania and their territory of the lower counties the fact that delaware and pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique from 1703 to 1738 new york and new jersey shared a governor massachusetts and new hampshire also shared a governor for some time dependent in early years on indentured labor delaware imported more slaves as the number of english  decreased with better economic conditions in england the colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop although english immigrants continued to arrive american revolution
like the other middle colonies the lower counties on the delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with  the citizenry had a good relationship with the proprietary government and generally were allowed more independence of action in their colonial assembly than in other colonies merchants at the port of wilmington had trading ties with the british so it was that new castle lawyer  denounced the  in the strongest terms and kent county native  became the  penman of the revolution  anticipating the declaration of independence  leaders thomas mckean and  convinced the colonial assembly to declare itself separated from british and pennsylvania rule on june 15 1776 the person best representing delaware s majority  could not bring himself to vote for a declaration of independence only the dramatic overnight ride of caesar rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast delaware s vote for independence initially led by  delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the  known as the  delaware blues  and nicknamed the    in august 1777  led a british army through delaware on his way to a victory at the  and capture of the city of philadelphia the only real engagement on delaware soil was the  fought on september 3 1777 at  in new castle county following the battle of brandywine wilmington was occupied by the british and   was taken prisoner the british remained in control of the delaware river for much of the rest of the war disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active  portion of the population particularly in sussex county because the british promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines following the  statesmen from delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central united states with equal representation for each state slavery and race

many colonial settlers came to delaware from maryland and virginia which had been experiencing a population boom the economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation most of the english colonists arrived as  under contracts to work as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african  or laborers was fluid and the working classes often lived closely together most of the free african-american families in delaware before the revolution had migrated from maryland to find more affordable land they were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved servant or free african or african-american men as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened at the end of the colonial period the number of enslaved people in delaware began to decline shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for slaves  labor local  and  encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the american revolution and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons by 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in delaware were free when john dickinson freed his slaves in 1777 he was delaware s largest slave owner with 37 slaves by 1860 the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice by the  on the verge of the  91.7 of the black population were free  1,798 were slaves as compared to 19,829  free colored persons  the independent black denomination was chartered by freed slave  in 1813 as the   this followed the 1793 establishment of the african methodist episcopal church in philadelphia which had ties to the methodist episcopal church until 1816 spencer built a church in wilmington for the new denomination this was renamed the  more commonly known as the  begun by spencer in 1814 the annual gathering of the  still draws people together in a religious and cultural festival the oldest such cultural festival in the nation delaware voted against secession on january 3 1861 and so remained in the union while most delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state some served in companies on the confederate side in  and  regiments delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled delaware essentially freed the few slaves that were still in bondage shortly after the civil war but rejected the   and  amendments to the constitution  the 13th amendment was rejected on february 8 1865 the 14th amendment was rejected on february 8 1867 and the 15th amendment was rejected on march 18 1869 delaware officially ratified the 13th 14th and 15th amendments on february 12 1901 demographics
