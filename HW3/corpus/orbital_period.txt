the orbital period is the time a given  takes to complete one  around another object and applies in  usually to  or  orbiting the   orbiting planets  orbiting other  or  for objects in the  this is often referred to as the sidereal period determined by a 360 revolution of one celestial body around another e.g the earth orbiting the sun the name sidereal is added as it implies that the object returns to the same position relative to the   when describing orbits of binary stars the orbital period is usually referred to as just the period for example  has a sidereal period of 11.86 years while the main binary star  ab has a period of about 79.91 years another important orbital period definition can refer to the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the earth s surface an example is the so-called synodic period applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location for example when any planet returns between its consecutive observed  with or  to the sun for example  has a synodic period of 398.8 days from earth  thus jupiter s opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months periods in astronomy are conveniently expressed in various units of time often in hours days or years they can be also defined under different specific astronomical definitions that are mostly caused by small complex eternal gravitational influences by other celestial objects such variations also include the true placement of the centre of gravity between two astronomical bodies    by other planets or bodies   etc most are investigated by detailed complex astronomical theories using  using precise positional observations of celestial objects via

other periods related to the orbital period 
there are many  related to the orbits of objects each of which are often used in the various fields of  and  examples of some of the common ones include 

the sidereal period is the amount of time that it takes an object to make a full orbit relative to the  this is the orbital period in an inertial  non-rotating   the synodic period is the amount of time that it takes for an object to reappear at the same point in relation to two or more other objects  e.g the  s phase and its position relative to the  and  repeats every 29.5 day synodic period longer than its 27.3 day orbit around the earth due to the motion of the earth about the sun  the time between two successive  or  is also an example of the synodic period for the planets in the solar system the synodic period  with respect to earth  differs from the sidereal period due to the earth s orbiting around the sun the draconitic period or draconic period is the time that elapses between two passages of the object through its  the point of its orbit where it crosses the  from the southern to the northern hemisphere this period differs from the sidereal period because both the orbital plane of the object and the plane of the ecliptic precess with respect to the fixed stars so their intersection the  also precesses with respect to the fixed stars although the plane of the ecliptic is often held fixed at the position it occupied at a specific  the orbital plane of the object still precesses causing the draconitic period to differ from the sidereal period the anomalistic period is the time that elapses between two passages of an object at its   in the case of the planets in the  called the   the point of its closest approach to the attracting body it differs from the sidereal period because the object s  typically advances slowly also the earth s tropical period  or simply its  year  is the time that elapses between two alignments of its axis of rotation with the sun also viewed as two passages of the object at  zero one earth year has a slightly shorter interval than the solar orbit  sidereal period  because the inclined axis and equatorial plane slowly   rotate with respect to the stars  realigning with the sun before the orbit completes the earth s precession cycle completes in about 25,770 years 



the semi-major axis  a  and semi-minor axis  b  of an ellipse


according to  the orbital period t  in seconds  of two bodies orbiting each other in a circular or  is 



where 

a is the orbit s  in meters
   gm is the  in m3 s2

g is the  m is the mass of the more massive body 


for all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same regardless of eccentricity inversely for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to pulse a given orbital period 



where 

a is the orbit s semi-major axis in meters g is the gravitational constant m is the mass of the more massive body t is the orbital period in seconds 
for instance for completing an orbit every 24 around a mass of 100 a small body has to orbit at a distance of 1.08 from its  orbital period as a function of central body s density 
when a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density   in kg m3  the above equation simplifies to  since m  v  4 3a3 



so for the earth as the central body  or any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density about 5,515kg m3  we get 

t   1.41 hours

and for a body made of water  1,000kg m3 

t   3.30 hours

thus as an alternative for using a very small number like g the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material like water  the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes conversely this can be used as a kind of  universal   if we have a unit of mass a unit of length and a unit of density two bodies orbiting each other 
in  when both orbiting bodies  masses have to be taken into account the orbital period t can be calculated as follows 



where 

a is the sum of the  of the ellipses in which the centers of the bodies move or equivalently the semi-major axis of the ellipse in which one body moves in the frame of reference with the other body at the origin  which is equal to their constant separation for circular orbits  m1   m2 is the sum of the masses of the two bodies g is the  
note that the orbital period is independent of size  for a scale model it would be the same when densities are the same  see also   
in a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory the motion is not periodic and the duration of the full trajectory is infinite synodic period 
there are observable characteristics of two bodies which orbit a third body in different orbits and thus have different orbital periods this is known as their synodic period  it is the time between  and since it is observable from either the first or the second body the two synodic periods will be different depending from which celestial body you are observing an example of this related period description is the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the earth s surface the so-called synodic period applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location for example when any planet returns between its consecutive observed  with or  to the sun for example  has a synodic period of 398.8 days from earth  thus jupiter s opposition occurs once roughly every 13 months if the orbital periods of the two bodies around the third are called p1 and p2 so that p1 p2 their synodic period is given by 
table of synodic periods in the solar system relative to earth 

in the case of a planet s  the synodic period usually means the sun-synodic period namely the time it takes the moon to complete its illumination phases completing the solar phases for an astronomer on the planet s surface the earth s motion does not determine this value for other planets because an earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question for example  s synodic period is 1.2648days 0.18 longer than deimos s sidereal period of 1.2624d
