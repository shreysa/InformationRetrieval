an efficient data structure for the simulation event set recently algorithms have been presented for the realization of event scheduling routines suitable for general purpose discrete event simulation systems several exhibited a performance superior to that of commonly used simple linked list algorithms in this paper a new event scheduling algorithm is presented which improves on two aspects of the best of the previously published algorithms First, the new algorithms performance is quite insensitive to skewed distributions and second its worst-case complexity is o n where n is the number of events in the set Furthermore, tests conducted to estimate the average complexity showed it to be nearly independent of n cacm August, 1977 Franta, W.
