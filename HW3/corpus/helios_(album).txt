upon its release helios received generally mixed reviews from music critics kevin catchpole from  gave the album six out of ten discs commenting that  the disappointing thing is how slight moments of innovation appear for fleeting seconds only then disappear into the ether it suggests a band that is capable of so much more if only it wanted to try  andy argyrakis of  rated the album three stars out of five remarking how the release contains  plenty of uplifting and contemplative lyrics  yet their  signature piano pop surfaces on occasion there seems to be a gravitation toward gang-styled choruses and massive electronic beats which sometimes succeed but periodically appear too derivative of today s top 40 
james christopher monger from  gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars indicating how that  helios begins innocuously enough with  hold my hand  a straight-up anthem generator-spawned arm-waver that pairs a safe circular entirely familiar chord progression with a melody that returns the favor  a description that applies to most if not all of the ten songs that follow  before unleashing the album s first single  love don t die  a digitized boot-stomper that leans hard on the   side of the fray spectrum flirtations with disco  give it away  and purecloned electro-pop  hurricane  follow but the fray never sound as comfortable as they do when they re dishing out relatively generic yet undeniably impassioned slabs of    andinspired open-highway treacle like  our last days  and  wherever this goes
