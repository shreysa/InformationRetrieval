minimal event-node network of project precedence relations a procedure for constructing a minimal event-node network to represent a set of precedence relations without parallel activities is presented a minimal event-node network is an event-node network in which both the number of nodes and the number of arcs are the minima to preserve the given precedence relations counterexamples are given to show that the algorithm presented by A. C. Fisher, J. S. Liebman, and G. L. nemhauser 1968 produces event-node networks which are not minimal since our procedure includes the set-covering problem the time required may grow exponentially with the number of given activities cacm May, 1973 Corneil, D.
