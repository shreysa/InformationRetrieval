earth s atmosphere has no definite boundary slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space three-quarters of the atmosphere s mass is contained within the first 11km  6.8mi  of the surface this lowest layer is called the troposphere energy from the sun heats this layer and the surface below causing expansion of the air this lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler higher-density air the result is  that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy the primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the  in the equatorial region below 30 latitude and the  in the mid-latitudes between 30 and 60  are also important factors in determining climate particularly the  that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm humid air this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes this  is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods precipitation patterns vary widely ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter atmospheric circulation topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region the amount of solar energy reaching earth s surface decreases with increasing latitude at higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere as a result the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4c  0.7f  per degree of latitude from the equator earth s surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate ranging from the equator to the polar regions these are the   or equatorial    and  climates this latitudinal rule has several anomalies 

proximity to oceans moderates the climate for example the  has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of  the  enables this moderating effect the windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side in the northern hemisphere the prevailing wind is west-to-east and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts this is seen in eastern north america and western europe where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean in the southern hemisphere the prevailing wind is east-to-west and the eastern coasts are milder the distance from the earth to the sun varies the earth is closest to the sun  at   in january which is summer in the southern hemisphere it is furthest away  at   in july which is summer in the northern hemisphere and only 93.55 of the solar radiation from the sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion despite this there are larger land masses in the northern hemisphere which are easier to heat than the seas consequently summers are 2.3c  4f  warmer in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere under similar conditions the climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density 
the commonly used  system has five broad groups      and cold   which are further divided into more specific subtypes the kppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation the highest air temperature ever measured on earth was 56.7c  134.1f  in  in  in 1913 the lowest air temperature ever directly measured on earth was 89.2c  128.6f  at  in 1983 but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as 94.7c  138.5f  in  these temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on earth upper atmosphere




this view from orbit shows the  partially obscured by earth s atmosphere 

above the troposphere the atmosphere is usually divided into the   and  each layer has a different  defining the rate of change in temperature with height beyond these the  thins out into the  where the geomagnetic fields interact with the  within the stratosphere is the ozone layer a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on earth the  defined as 100km above earth s surface is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and  thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth s gravity this causes a slow but steady  because unfixed  has a low  it can achieve  more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth s atmosphere and surface from an initially  state to its current  one photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth in the current oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape instead most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere gravitational field

the axial tilt of the earth is approximately 23.439281 with the axis of its orbit plane always pointing towards the  due to earth s axial tilt the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year this causes the seasonal change in climate with  in the  occurring when the  is facing the sun and  taking place when the  in the  faces the sun during the summer the day lasts longer and the sun climbs higher in the sky in winter the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter in northern temperate latitudes the sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice and sets north of true west reversing in the winter the sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west above the  an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year up to six months at the north pole itself a  in the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed with the  oriented opposite the direction of the north pole six months later this pole will experience a  a day of 24 hours again reversing with the south pole by astronomical convention the four seasons can be determined by the the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the sunand the  when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the sun are perpendicular in the northern hemisphere  currently occurs around 21 december   is near 21 june  is around 20 march and  is about 22 or 23 september in the southern hemisphere the situation is reversed with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped the angle of earth s axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time its axial tilt does undergo   a slight irregular motion with a main period of 18.6years the orientation  rather than the angle  of earth s axis also changes over time  around in a complete circle over each 25,800year cycle  this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a  both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the sun and the moon on earth s equatorial bulge the poles also migrate a few meters across earth s surface this  has multiple cyclical components which collectively are termed  in addition to an annual component to this motion there is a 14-month cycle called the  earth s rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation in modern times earth s  occurs around 3 january and its  around 4 july these dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors which follow cyclical patterns known as  the changing earthsun distance causes an increase of about 6.9 in solar energy reaching earth at perihelion relative to aphelion because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun at about the same time that earth reaches the closest approach to the sun the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the sun than does the northern over the course of a year this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere a study from 2016 suggested that  tilted all  planets including earth s by about 6 degrees habitability
