history 
wikisource s early  20032005  history included several changes of name and location   and the move to language subdomains in 2005 early history 
the original concept for wikisource was as storage for useful or important historical texts these texts were intended to support  articles by providing primary evidence and original source texts and as an archive in its own right the collection was initially focused on important historical and cultural material distinguishing it from other digital archives such as project gutenberg 



the original wikisource logo


the project was originally called project sourceberg during its planning stages  a play on words for   in 2001 there was a dispute on wikipedia regarding the addition of primary source material leading to  over their inclusion or deletion project sourceberg was suggested as a solution to this in describing the proposed project user the cunctator said  it would be to project gutenberg what wikipedia is to   soon clarifying the statement with  we don t want to try to duplicate project gutenberg s efforts  rather we want to complement them perhaps project sourceberg can mainly work as an interface for easily linking from wikipedia to a project gutenberg file and as an interface for people to easily submit new work to pg  initial comments were sceptical with  questioning the need for the project writing  the hard question i guess is why we are reinventing the wheel when project gutenberg already exists  we d want to complement project gutenberg--how exactly  and  adding  like larry i m interested that we think it over to see what we can add to project gutenberg it seems unlikely that primary sources should in general be editable by anyone  i mean shakespeare is shakespeare unlike our commentary on his work which is whatever we want it to be 
the project began its activity at ps.wikipedia.org the contributors understood the  ps  subdomain to mean either  primary sources  or project sourceberg however this resulted in project sourceberg occupying the subdomain of the   the  of the  is  ps  project sourceberg officially launched on november 24 2003 when it received its own temporary url at sources.wikipedia.org and all texts and discussions hosted on ps.wikipedia.org were moved to the temporary address a vote on the project s name changed it to wikisource on december 6 2003 despite the change in name the project did not move to its permanent url  at   until july 23 2004 
logo and slogan 
since wikisource was initially called  project sourceberg  its first logo was a picture of an  two votes conducted to choose a successor were inconclusive and the original logo remained until 2006 finally for both legal and technical reasons  because the picture s license was inappropriate for a wikimedia foundation logo and because a photo cannot scale properly  a stylized vector iceberg inspired by the original picture was mandated to serve as the project s logo the first prominent use of wikisource s slogan  the free library  was at the project s  when it was redesigned based upon the wikipedia portal on august 27 2005  historical version  as in the wikipedia portal the wikisource slogan appears around the logo in the project s ten largest languages clicking on the portal s central images  the iceberg logo in the center and the  wikisource  heading at the top of the page  links to a  for wikisource and the free library in 60 languages tools built 




the proofread page extension in action 

a  extension called proofreadpage was developed for wikisource by developer thomasv to improve the vetting of transcriptions by the project this displays pages of scanned works side-by-side with the text relating to that page allowing the text to be proofread and its accuracy later verified independently by any other editor once a book or other text has been scanned the raw images can be modified with  software to correct for page rotations and other problems the retouched images can then be converted into a  or  file and uploaded to either wikisource or  this system assists editors in ensuring the accuracy of texts on wikisource the original page scans of completed works remain available to any user so that errors may be corrected later and readers may check texts against the originals proofreadpage also allows greater participation since access to a physical copy of the original work is not necessary to be able to contribute to the project once images have been uploaded thus it enhances the project s commitment to the wikimedia principle that anyone can contribute thomasv built other tools as well  when the choice of whether publishing annotations or not was discussed he made a gadget to offer the choice between texts alone or annotated texts when the choice of modernizing or not the texts was discussed he made another gadget to modernize the original text only when it was wished so that it could be decided then that the texts themselves would be the original ones

within two weeks of the project s official start at sources.wikipedia.org over 1,000 pages had been created with approximately 200 of these being designated as actual articles on january 4 2004 wikisource welcomed its 100th registered user in early july 2004 the number of articles exceeded 2,400 and more than 500 users had registered on april 30 2005 there were 2667 registered users  including 18 administrators  and almost 19,000 articles the project passed its 96,000th edit that same day 
on november 27 2005 the english wikisource passed 20,000 text-units in its third month of existence already holding more texts than did the entire project in april  before the move to language subdomains  on february 14 2008 the english wikisource passed 100,000 text-units with  of  a memoir by painter  in november 2011 250,000 text-units milestone was passed but counting was difficult because what a text-unit is could not be clearly defined on may 10 2006 the  was created library contents 




wikisource inclusion criteria expressed as a  green indicates the best possible case where the work satisfies all three primary requirements yellow indicates acceptable but not ideal cases 

wikisource collects and stores in  previously published texts  including novels non-fiction works letters speeches constitutional and historical documents laws and a range of other documents all texts collected are either free of copyright or released under the  texts in all languages are welcome as are translations in addition to texts wikisource hosts material such as comics films recordings and spoken-word works all texts held by wikisource must have been previously published  the project does not host   books or documents produced by its contributors a scanned source is preferred on many wikisources and required on some most wikisources will however accept works transcribed from offline sources or acquired from  the requirement for prior publication can also be waived in a small number of cases if the work is a source document of notable historical importance the legal requirement for works to be licensed or free of copyright remains constant the only original pieces accepted by wikisource are annotations and translations wikisource and its sister project  has the capacity for  of texts on wikisource the annotations are supplementary to the original text which remains the primary objective of the project by contrast on wikibooks the annotations are primary with the original text as only a reference or supplement if present at all annotated editions are more popular on the german wikisource the project also accommodates translations of texts provided by its users a significant translation on the english wikisource is the  project intended to create a new  laissez-faire translation  of  structure
a separate  of wikisource   was created in august 2004 the need for a language-specific  website derived from the difficulty of typing and editing hebrew texts in a  environment  hebrew is written right-to-left  in the ensuing months contributors in other languages including  requested their own wikis but a december vote on the creation of separate language domains was inconclusive finally a  that ended may 12 2005 supported the adoption of separate language subdomains at wikisource by a large margin allowing each language to host its texts on its own wiki an initial wave of 14 languages was set up by  on august 23 2005 the new languages did not include english but the code en  was temporarily set to redirect to the main website   at this point the wikisource community through a mass project of manually sorting thousands of pages and categories by language prepared for a second wave of page imports to local wikis on september 11 2005 the wikisource.org wiki was reconfigured to enable the  along with 8 other languages that were created early that morning and late the night before three more languages were created on march 29 2006 and then another large wave of 14 language domains was created on june 2 2006 currently there are individual subdomains for wikisources in more than 60 languages besides the additional languages hosted at  which serves as an incubator or a home for languages without their own subdomains  31 languages are currently   wikisource.org 
during the move to language subdomains the community requested that the main  website remain a functioning wiki in order to serve three purposes 

to be a multilingual coordination site for the entire wikisource project in all languages in practice use of the website for multilingual coordination has not been heavy since the conversion to language domains nevertheless there is some policy activity at the  and multilingual updates for news and language milestones at pages such as  to be a home for texts in languages without their own subdomains each with its own local main page for self-organization as a language incubator the wiki currently provides a home for over 30 languages that do not yet have their own language subdomains some of these are very active and have built libraries with hundreds of texts  such as esperanto and volapuk  and one with thousands  hindi  to provide direct ongoing support by a local wiki community for a dynamic multilingual portal at its main page for users who go to  the current  was created on august 26 2005 by  who based it upon the wikipedia portal 
the idea of a project-specific coordination wiki first realized at wikisource also took hold in another wikimedia project namely at  s  like wikisource.org it serves wikiversity coordination in all languages and as a language incubator but unlike wikisource its  does not serve as its multilingual portal  which is not a wiki page  reception 





personal explanation of wikisource from a project participant
