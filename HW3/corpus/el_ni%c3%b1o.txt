the 199798 el nio observed by  the white areas indicate the pool of warm water off the tropical western coasts of northern south and all central america as well as along the central-eastern equatorial and southeastern pacific ocean 

el nio   spanish pronunciation  is the warm phase of the   commonly called enso  and is associated with a band of warm ocean water that develops in the central and east-central equatorial   between approximately the  and 120w  including off the pacific coast of  el nio southern oscillation refers to the cycle of warm and cold temperatures as measured by  sst of the tropical central and eastern pacific ocean el nio is accompanied by high  in the western pacific and low air pressure in the eastern pacific the cool phase of enso is called   with sst in the eastern pacific below average and air pressures high in the eastern and low in western pacific the enso cycle both el nio and la nia cause global changes of both temperatures and rainfall  that are dependent upon agriculture and fishing particularly those bordering the pacific ocean are usually most affected in  the capitalized term  el nio  refers to  the little boy  so named because the pool of warm water in the pacific near south america is often at its warmest around  the original name  el nio de   traces its origin centuries back to  fishermen who named the weather phenomenon in reference to the   la nia  chosen as the  opposite  of el nio literally translates to  the little girl

concept 
originally the term el nio applied to an annual weak warm ocean current that ran southwards along the coast of  and  at about christmas time however over time the term has evolved and now refers to the warm and negative phase of the  and is the warming of the ocean surface or above-average sea surface temperatures in either the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean this warming causes a shift in the atmospheric circulation with rainfall becoming reduced over indonesia and australia while rainfall and tropical cyclone formation increases over the tropical pacific ocean the low-level surface trade winds which normally blow from east to west along the equator either weaken or start blowing from the other direction

historically el nio events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years for example it is thought that el nio affected the  in modern-day  who sacrificed humans in order to try to prevent the rains scientists have also found the chemical signatures of warmer sea surface temperatures and increased rainfall caused by el nio in coral specimens that are around 13,000years old in around 1525 when  made landfall on peru he noted rainfall occurring in the deserts which subsequently became the first written record of the impacts of el nio modern day research and reanalysis techniques have managed to find at least 26 el nio events since 1900 with the   and  events among the strongest on record currently each country has a different threshold for what constitutes an el nio event which is tailored to their specific interests for example the australian  looks at the trade winds soi weather models and sea surface temperatures in the nino 3 and 3.4 regions before declaring an el nio the united states climate prediction center  cpc  and the   iri  looks at the sea surface temperatures in the nino 3.4 region the tropical pacific atmosphere and forecasts that noaa s oceanic nio index will equal or exceed  0.5c for several seasons in a row however the  declares that an el nio event has started when the average 5 month sea surface temperature deviation for the nino.3 region is over 0.5c  0.90f  warmer for 6 consecutive months or longer the peruvian government declares that a coastal el nino is under way if the sea surface temperatures in the nino 1 and 2 regions equal or exceed  0.4c for at least 3 months there is no consensus on if climate change will have any influence on the occurrence strength or duration of el nio events as research supports el nio events becoming stronger longer shorter and weaker occurrences 


a timeline of all the el nio episodes between 1900 and 2016 
el nio events are thought to have been occurring for thousands of years for example it is thought that el nio affected the inca empire in modern-day peru who sacrificed humans in order to try and prevent the rains it is thought that there have been at least 30 el nio events since 1900 with the   and  events among the strongest on record since 2000 el nio events have been observed in 200203 200405 200607 200910 and  major enso events were recorded in the years 179093 1828 187678 1891 192526 197273 198283 199798 and 201416 typically this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of two to seven years and lasts nine months to two years the average period length is five years when this warming occurs for seven to nine months it is classified as el nio  conditions  when its duration is longer it is classified as an el nio  episode  there is no consensus on whether climate change will have any influence on the occurrence strength or duration of el nio events as research supports el nio events becoming stronger longer shorter and weaker during strong el nio episodes a secondary peak in sea surface temperature across the far eastern equatorial pacific ocean sometimes follows the initial peak cultural history and prehistoric information

enso conditions have occurred at two to seven-year intervals for at least the past 300 years but most of them have been weak evidence is also strong for el nio events during the early  epoch 10,000 years ago el nio may have led to the demise of the  and other pre-columbian  a recent study suggests a strong el-nio effect between 1789 and 1793 caused poor crop yields in europe which in turn helped touch off the  the extreme weather produced by el nio in 187677 gave rise to the most deadly  of the 19th century the  alone in northern china killed up to 13 million people an early recorded mention of the term  el nio  to refer to climate occurred in 1892 when  told the geographical society congress in  that peruvian sailors named the warm north-flowing current  el nio  because it was most noticeable around christmas the phenomenon had long been of interest because of its effects on the  industry and other enterprises that depend on biological productivity of the sea  in 1888 suggested droughts in india and australia tended to occur at the same time   noted the same in 1904 an el nio connection with flooding was reported in 1894 by    18521919  and in 1895 by federico alfonso pezet  18591929  in 1924   for whom the  is named  coined the term  southern oscillation  he and others  including norwegian-american meteorologist   are generally credited with identifying the el nio effect the major 198283 el nio led to an upsurge of interest from the scientific community the period 19911995 was unusual in that el nios have rarely occurred in such rapid succession an especially intense el nio event in 1998 caused an estimated 16 of the world s reef systems to die the event temporarily warmed air temperature by 1.5c compared to the usual increase of 0.25c associated with el nio events since then mass  has become common worldwide with all regions having suffered  severe bleaching  diversity

it is thought that there are several different types of el nio events with the canonical eastern pacific and the modoki central pacific types being the two that receive the most attention these different types of el nio events are classified by where the tropical pacific sea surface temperature  sst  anomalies are the largest for example the strongest sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the canonical eastern pacific event are located off the coast of south america the strongest anomalies associated with the modoki central pacific event are located near the  however during the duration of a single event the area with the greatest sea surface temperature anomalies can change the traditional nio also called eastern pacific  ep  el nio involves temperature anomalies in the eastern pacific however in the last two decades nontraditional el nios were observed in which the usual place of the temperature anomaly  nio 1 and 2  is not affected but an anomaly arises in the central pacific  nio 3.4  the phenomenon is called central pacific  cp  el nio  dateline  el nio  because the anomaly arises near the   or el nio  modoki   modoki is  for  similar but different  the effects of the cp el nio are different from those of the traditional ep el nioe.g the recently discovered el nio leads to more hurricanes more frequently making landfall in the atlantic there is also a scientific debate on the very existence of this  new  enso indeed a number of studies dispute the reality of this statistical distinction or its increasing occurrence or both either arguing the reliable record is too short to detect such a distinction finding no distinction or trend using other statistical approaches or that other types should be distinguished such as standard and extreme enso the first recorded el nio that originated in the central pacific and moved toward the east was in 1986 recent central pacific el nios happened in 198687 199192 199495 200203 200405 and 200910 furthermore there were  modoki  events in 195759 196364 196566 196870 197778 and 197980 effects on the global climate 
el nino affects the global climate and disrupts normal weather patterns which as a result can lead to intense storms in some places and droughts in others tropical cyclones 
most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the  then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the  areas west of  and  tend to experience much fewer septembernovember tropical cyclone impacts during el nio and neutral years during el nio years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near  which would favor the japanese archipelago within the  vertical wind shear is increased which inhibits tropical cyclone genesis and intensification by causing the westerly winds in the atmosphere to be stronger the atmosphere over the atlantic ocean can also be drier and more stable during el nio events which can also inhibit tropical cyclone genesis and intensification within the   el nio events contribute to decreased easterly vertical wind shear and favours above-normal hurricane activity however the impacts of the enso state in this region can vary and are strongly influenced by background climate patterns the  experiences a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form during el nio events without a major change in how many develop each year as a result of this change micronesia is more likely to be affected by several tropical cyclones while china has a decreased risk of being affected by several tropical cyclones  a change in the location of where tropical cyclones form also occurs within the southern pacific ocean between 135e and 120w with tropical cyclones more likely to occur within the southern pacific basin than the australian region as a result of this change tropical cyclones are 50 less likely to make landfall on queensland while the risk of a tropical cyclone is elevated for island nations like     and the  remote influence on tropical atlantic ocean 
a study of climate records has shown that el nio events in the equatorial pacific are generally associated with a warm tropical north atlantic in the following spring and summer about half of el nio events persist sufficiently into the spring months for the  to become unusually large in summer occasionally el nio s effect on the atlantic walker circulation over south america strengthens the easterly trade winds in the western equatorial atlantic region as a result an unusual cooling may occur in the eastern equatorial atlantic in spring and summer following el nio peaks in winter cases of el nio-type events in both oceans simultaneously have been linked to severe  related to the extended failure of  rains antarctica 
many enso linkages exist in the high southern latitudes around  specifically el nio conditions result in  anomalies over the  and  seas causing reduced  and increased poleward heat fluxes in these sectors as well as the  the  conversely tends to become colder with more sea ice during el nio the exact opposite heating and atmospheric pressure anomalies occur during la nia this pattern of variability is known as the antarctic dipole mode although the antarctic response to enso forcing is not ubiquitous regional impacts 
observations of el nio events since 1950 show that impacts associated with el nio events depend on what season it is however while certain events and impacts are expected to occur during events it is not certain or guaranteed that they will occur the impacts that generally do occur during most el nio events include below-average rainfall over indonesia and northern south america while above average rainfall occurs in southeastern south america eastern equatorial africa and the southern united states australia and the southern pacific 
during el nio events the shift in rainfall away from the western pacific may mean that rainfall across australia is reduced over the southern part of the continent warmer than average temperatures can be recorded as weather systems are more mobile and fewer blocking areas of high pressure occur the onset of the  in tropical australia is delayed by two to six weeks which as a consequence means that rainfall is reduced over the northern tropics the risk of a significant bushfire season in south-eastern australia is higher following an el nio event especially when it is combined with a positive  event during an el nio event new zealand tends to experience stronger or more frequent westerly winds during their summer which leads to an elevated risk of drier than normal conditions along the east coast there is more rain than usual though on new zealand s west coast because of the barrier effect of the north island mountain ranges and the southern alps fiji generally experiences drier than normal conditions during an el nio which can lead to drought becoming established over the islands however the main impacts on the island nation is felt about a year after the event becomes established within the samoan islands below average rainfall and higher than normal temperatures are recorded during el nio events which can lead to droughts and forest fires on the islands other impacts include a decrease in the sea level possibility of coral bleaching in the marine environment and an increased risk of a tropical cyclone affecting samoa africa 
in africa  including   and the  basin experiences in the long rains from march to may wetter-than-normal conditions conditions are also drier than normal from december to february in south-central africa mainly in    and  asia 
as warm water spreads from the west pacific and the  to the east pacific it takes the rain with it causing extensive drought in the western pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern pacific singapore experienced the driest february in 2014 since records began in 1869 with only 6.3mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35c on 26 february the years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest februaries when 8.4mm of rain fell

el nio s effects on  are controversial complex and difficult to analyse as it is one of several factors that influence the weather over the continent and other factors can overwhelm the signal north america

over north america the main temperature and precipitation impacts of el nio generally occur in the six months between october and march in particular the majority of canada generally has a milder than normal winters and cold fronts springs with the exception of eastern canada where no significant impacts occur within the united states the impacts generally observed during the six-month period include  wetter-than-average conditions along the  between  and  while drier conditions are observed in  the   and the  over california and the south-western united states there is a weak relationship between el nino and above-average precipitation as it strongly depends on the strength of the el nio event amongst other factors the  condition for the  is associated with  forming in  of mexico in the wake of an advancing cold front which causes winds to accelerate through the  tehuantepecers primarily occur during the cold season months for the region in the wake of cold fronts between october and february with a summer maximum in july caused by the westward extension of the  wind magnitude is greater during el nio years than during  years due to the more frequent cold frontal incursions during el nio winters its effects can last from a few hours to six days south america 
because el nio s warm pool feeds thunderstorms above it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern pacific ocean including several portions of the south american west coast the effects of el nio in south america are direct and stronger than in north america an el nio is associated with warm and very wet weather months in apriloctober along the coasts of northern  and  causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme the effects during the months of february march and april may become critical along the west coast of  el nio reduces the upwelling of cold nutrient-rich water that sustains large  populations which in turn sustain abundant sea birds whose droppings support the  industry the reduction in upwelling leads to  off the shore of peru the local fishing industry along the affected coastline can suffer during long-lasting el nio events the world s largest fishery collapsed due to overfishing during the 1972 el nio  reduction during the 198283 event  and anchoveta populations were reduced  increased in warmer water but  followed cooler water down the continental slope while  and  moved southward so some catches decreased while others increased  have increased in the region during warm events shifting locations and types of fish due to changing conditions provide challenges for fishing industries peruvian  have moved during el nio events to  areas other conditions provide further complications such as the government of chile in 1991 creating restrictions on the fishing areas for self-employed fishermen and industrial fleets 
the enso variability may contribute to the great success of small fast-growing species along the peruvian coast as periods of low population removes predators in the area similar effects benefit  birds that travel each spring from predator-rich tropical areas to distant winter-stressed nesting areas 
southern  and northern  also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer central chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall and the peruvian-bolivian  is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the  basin  and  



el nio has the most direct impacts on life in the equatorial pacific its effects propagate north and south along the coast of the americas affecting marine life all around the pacific changes in chlorophyll-a concentrations are visible in this animation which compares  in january and july 1998 since then scientists have improved both the collection and presentation of  data 

when el nio conditions last for many months extensive ocean warming and the reduction in easterly trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water and its economic effect on local fishing for an international market can be serious more generally el nio can affect commodity prices and the macroeconomy of different countries it can constrain the supply of rain-driven agricultural commodities  reduce agricultural output construction and services activities  create food-price and generalised inflation  and may trigger social unrest in commodity-dependent poor countries that primarily rely on imported food a university of cambridge working paper shows that while australia chile indonesia india japan new zealand and south africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an el nio shock other countries may actually benefit from an el nio weather shock  either directly or indirectly through positive spillovers from major trading partners  for instance argentina canada mexico and the united states furthermore most countries experience short-run inflationary pressures following an el nio shock while global energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase the imf estimates a significant el nio can boost the gdp of the united states by about 0.5  due largely to lower heating bills  and reduce the gdp of indonesia by about 1.0 health and social effects 
extreme weather conditions related to the el nio cycle correlate with changes in the incidence of  diseases for example the el nio cycle is associated with increased risks of some of the diseases transmitted by  such as   and  cycles of malaria in    and  have now been linked to el nio outbreaks of another mosquito-transmitted disease australian encephalitis  mve  occur in temperate south-east australia after heavy rainfall and flooding which are associated with la nia events a severe outbreak of rift valley fever occurred after extreme rainfall in north-eastern kenya and southern somalia during the 199798 el nio enso conditions have also been related to  incidence in japan and the west coast of the united states via the linkage to tropospheric winds across the north pacific ocean enso may be linked to civil conflicts scientists at  of  having analyzed data from 1950 to 2004 suggest enso may have had a role in 21 of all civil conflicts since 1950 with the risk of annual civil conflict doubling from 3 to 6 in countries affected by enso during el nio years relative to la nia years references
