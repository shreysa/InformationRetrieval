in late october1991 a tropical disturbance developed near the  tracking generally west-northwestward the system gradually became more defined on october31  associated with the system quickly increased prompting the issuance of a  from the   jtwc  early on november1 the   jma  began monitoring the system as a tropical depression at which time the system was situated roughly 415km  260mi  north-northeast of  following a satellite-derived surface wind estimate of 45km h  30mph  later that day the jtwc also began monitoring the low as a tropical depression initially  showed the system continuing on an arcing path out to sea  however the system turned westward on november2 and threatened the  due to the cyclone s proximity to the country the  also monitored the storm and  uring late on november3 the depression turned west-southwestward towards the  in response to an approaching  an event typical of late-season cyclones in the basin on november4 both the jtwc and jma upgraded the system to a tropical storm with the latter assigning it the name thelma hours before striking the philippines on november4 both agencies reported thelma to have reached its peak intensity the jtwc estimated the storm to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 85km h  50mph  while the jma estimated ten-minute sustained winds at 75km h  45mph  additionally its  reached 992   29.29  thelma soon made  in  before weakening to a minimal tropical storm maintaining gale-force winds the system eventually passed over  on november6 before moving over the  despite being back over water strong  prevented re-intensification and caused thelma to weaken to a tropical depression by november7 now moving westward the depression eventually made its final landfall over the  in southern  on november8 over the next couple of days the system weakened into an area of low pressure as it moved westwards before it moved into the andaman sea during november 10 once in the andaman sea the systems remnants contributed to the formation of the  during the next day impact 




tropical storm thelma over the visayas on november5


tropical storm thelma struck the philippines just five months after the  of  the eruption resulted in the deaths of roughly 800people and left nearly 1million homeless the country s government was reportedly struggling to deal with the scope of the disaster and the addition of thelma worsened the situation striking the nation as a weak tropical storm winds from thelma gusted up to 95km h  60mph  in   these winds caused no known damage the main destructive force associated with the cyclone was the tremendous rainfall it produced more than 150mm  6in  of rain across much of the visayas resulting in widespread flooding in tacloban 140.2mm  5.52in  fell over a 24hour span the heaviest rain occurred on  due to  which brought large quantities of moisture into the atmosphere over a relatively small area additionally  winds to the southwest of thelma converged over the island further enhancing the precipitation near the city of  a  rain gauge measured 580.5mm  22.85in  of precipitation the highest in relation to the storm of this approximately 500mm  20in  fell during a three-hour span around noon local time on november5 initially residents believed that  transported tremendous amounts of water to the island triggering the floods this notion was quickly dismissed as improbable however the hardest hit region was leyte where more than 4,000people lost their lives a total of 4,446homes were destroyed while another 22,229were damaged the majority of casualties and damage took place in ormoc when a flash flood devastated the city at least 81people were killed outside ormoc and another 14went missing  42lost their lives in  the entire island of leyte was left without power and many areas were isolated as roads were washed away another 78people perished and 70others were left missing in  losses from the storm amounted to  27.67million   18.94million in leyte and  8.73million in negros occidental a total of 598,454people were affected while an estimated 43,000people were left homeless by the storm across the philippines ormoc city tragedy 




location of ormoc on leyte island


the greatest tragedy during tropical storm thelma took place in the city of ormoc after torrential rains overwhelmed the anilaomalbasag  sending flood waters rushing down the  mountainside this water flowed into the anilao and malbasag rivers located north of ormoc the watershed covering an area of 4,567  11,285  is only 3.3percent forested with the remainder being used for agricultural and private purposes according to a study in 1990 roughly 90percent of the watershed had been converted into  and  plantations the majority of this land was improperly cultivated since the 1970s making conditions worse than they normally would have been the natural structure of the mountains further contributed to the floods with slopes as steep as 60percent grade in some areas in heavy rain events this feature leaves the upper two-thirds of the mountain range unstable in the two hours prior to the heaviest rains the soil in the watershed became saturated greatly lessening its effectiveness at absorbing further rains as a result the tremendous rains that occurred just prior to the flood during which rainfall rates reached 167mm  6.6in  per hour the land was unable to absorb a majority of the rain many landslides ranging from 1 to 3m  3.3 to 9.8ft  deep and 50 to 100m  160 to 330ft  wide occurred across the region altogether rains were twice as heavy as the land could handle and the many landslips doubled the volume of fluids at various points along rivers temporary dams created by debris namely trees allowed a build up of water upstream in some instances waters reached a depth of 10m  33ft  before the dams collapsed normally it takes water in the anilao and malbasag rivers roughly 3.6 and 5.6days respectively to reach ormoc city  however it only took one hour during the flood ormoc city itself is located in a flood-prone area with the anilao and malbasag rivers converging just north of the city and taking a 90degree turn towards the bay in addition to the natural dangers of the river poorly designed structures on the river made conditions worse the majority of construction along the river did not take flooding threats into account and actually increased the threat of these events concrete walls and  were built into the river rather than on the banks leading to faster debris damming lastly just after the turn was the cogon bridge this structure constricted the river by as much as 50percent enhancing the build up of water the turn became the final trigger in the disaster as it created an  instantaneous backwater effect  causing massive volumes of water to over-top the riverbank around 11 00a.m local time on november5 approximately 22,835km3  5,480mi3  of water inundated 25km2  15.5mi2  of the city in just 15minutes the water rose by 2.1m  7ft  and further rose to 3.7m  12ft  within an hour the flooding lasted for roughly three hours leaving up to 0.6m  2.0ft  of sediment behind 

 the waters kept rising we had to place our children on top of the refrigerator still the waters kept going up so we all had to climb to the roof but perhaps we are bless we all survived 

survivor from isle verde
the flood struck the city with little to no warning catching all those in its path off-guard numerous low-income families lived along the banks of the river despite being such a high-risk area residential and commercial areas were also set up along reclaimed embankments that restricted river flow additionally squatters were allowed to live along the banks of the anilao river in an area called isle verde roughly 2,500people lived on this reclaimed land prior to the flood the majority of fatalities took place along the banks of the river with most drowning or being buried in mud or debris a survivor described the initial event as a gigantic wave crashing over the banks and flooding the city isle verde was virtually wiped out and out of the original 2,500people that lived there only 200survived it became known as the  isle of death  to survivors residents reported hundreds of bodies floating down rivers in the area the force of the water and mud was enough to crack the walls of city hall nearly 3,000homes were destroyed and more than 11,000others were damaged in the city alone officials confirmed that 4,922people were killed and another 1,8573,000were left missing additionally 3,020people were injured the majority of those missing were likely swept out to sea by the flood and presumed dead two days after the storm several bodies of those swept out to sea washed back ashore officials stated that the death toll could have been in the tens of thousands had the flood occurred at night rather than in the middle of the day aftermath

initially it took more than 24hours for word of the level of devastation to reach officials in  as communications across leyte were largely destroyed by november7 search and rescue operations were underway across leyte and negros occidental the first shipment of relief supplies consisting of food rations rice sardines and used clothing was to be shipped from  later that day on november8   declared all of leyte a  a  vessel set out with heavy earth-moving machinery and the  deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts relief efforts in ormoc city were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel amateur radio reports stated that an  was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region by november11 approximately 8,300families had been rescued and another 7,521were evacuated from affected regions supply distribution centers were established in ormoc providing residents with food water and materials by november11 people were given a can of sardines and 1kg  2.2lb  of rice at these centers these centers were only able to operate in daylight though due to a lack of fuel and transportation water was supplied in limited quantities from cebu medical and sanitation teams were deployed throughout the province with many coming from surrounding areas residents searched through debris for lumber to construct makeshift coffins while others stacked bodies to be picked up by wheelbarrows or trucks officials had difficulty determining how to best deal with mass casualties as bodies lay across the ormoc region many were found in the coastal  of linao camp downes and bantigue as well as the ormoc pier in order to prevent the spread of disease  were dug with 700bodies buried on november8 dump trucks were used to transport the dead to these sites as quickly as possible as decomposition set in residents stated that   putrid smell was unbearable  even months after the storm bodies were occasionally discovered some found in drainage systems by november10 four navy vessels were searching debris in the waters near ormoc for bodies  16 were recovered that day with more believed to be submerged in the bay roads surrounding the city were finally cleared by november12  however electricity remained out with the deployment of medical teams from  hospitals in the region returned to full capacity by november22 electricity and water had been 70percent and 60percent restored respectively the emergency phase of assistance ended on november29 and coordination of disaster relief was returned to the philippines by that time national aid to ormoc reached  1.1million with more than half coming from a presidential grant 

on november7 despite no official appeal for international aid the governments of  and the  provided  34,783 and  25,000 in funds the request for assistance came the following day with the philippines requesting food water medicine emergency supplies and heavy machinery a team from the  specializing with relief coordination and flood management was also sent the  appealed for  418,000 to support 15,000families for one month a cash grant of  17,300 from the  was received on november8 two  ac-130s from  flew to cebu carrying ready-to-eat meals international funding reached  2.5million on november12 with grants of  1.05million  1million  188,000 from the  japan and  respectively additionally the united states provided 55,000 packages of food rations this total nearly doubled two days later with grants from the      various branches of the red cross and the governments of  and  ultimately approximately  5.8million was provided in international assistance from 13nations the  the red cross and various non-governmental organizations isle verde where approximately 2,300people were killed was declared uninhabitable by officials  however residents still returned to the area due to a need for land eventually signs that used to warn people not to stay on the islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there a resettlement community was constructed months later with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families that needed to be moved from the area those that were not moved were left on isle verde despite orders not to stay there another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of  1million the sheer magnitude of the flood event in the anilaomalbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris raising their water levels and widening their banks in a post-disaster assessment in october 1992 it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future it was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas  however by the time of the report people had already begun repopulating the area as a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed  reforestation contoured farming and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in ormoc in 1993 following a request by the philippine government the  conducted as study on flood control for ormoc and other cities across the country in 1998 a 800million  20.6million usd  construction project for flood mitigation was approved and later completed in 2001 that year  caused flooding of similar magnitude to thelma  however the waters were properly diverted to the sea a sculpture and monument to the victims designed by architect maribeth ebcas and artist florence cinco respectively called  gift of life  was constructed on a 1.3km2  0.8mi2  plot of land it was designed to also depict a need to respect nature and be a message of hope for residents in ormoc due to the catastrophic loss of life caused by the storm the name thelma was  and replaced with teresa see also
