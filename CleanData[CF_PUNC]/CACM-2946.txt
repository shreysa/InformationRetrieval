an alternative to event queues for synchronization in monitors in the monitor concept as proposed by brinch hansen and Hoare, event are used for synchronization this paper describes another synchronizing primitive which is nearly as expressive as the conditional wait but can be implemented more efficiently an implementation of this primitive in terms of p and v operations is given together with a correctness proof two examples are presented the readers and writers problem and the problem of information streams sharing a finite buffer pool cacm July, 1977 Kessels, J.
