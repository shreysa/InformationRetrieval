waterspouts exist on a microscale where their environment is less than two kilometers in width the cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus or as great as a  while some waterspouts are strong and tornadic in nature most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics they normally develop in moisture-laden environments as their parent clouds are in the process of development and it is theorized they spin as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus cloud or thunderstorm weak tornadoes known as  have been shown to develop in a similar manner more than one waterspout can occur in the same vicinity at the same time as many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on  the illustration on the left by  in 1841 shows the manner in which one spout while forming tends to generate others in its neighborhood types

waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a   are known as  non-tornadic  or  fair-weather waterspouts  and are by far the most common type fair-weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark flat-bottomed developing convective  towers waterspouts of this type rapidly develop and dissipate having life cycles shorter than 20minutes they usually rate no higher than ef0 on the  generally exhibiting winds of less than 30m s  67mph  they are most frequently seen in tropical and sub-tropical climates with upwards of 400 per year observed in the  they typically move slowly if at all since the cloud to which they are attached is horizontally static being formed by vertical  instead of the subduction adduction interaction between colliding  fair-weather waterspouts are very similar in both appearance and mechanics to  and largely behave as such if they move ashore tornadic 
 tornadic waterspouts  also accurately referred to as  tornadoes over water  are formed from  in a manner essentially identical to traditional land-based tornadoes in connection with  but simply occurring over water a tornado which travels from land to a body of water would also be considered a tornadic waterspout since the vast majority of mesocyclonic thunderstorms occur in land-locked areas of the united states true tornadic waterspouts are correspondingly rarer than their fair-weather counterparts in that country however in some areas such as the   and  tornadic waterspouts can make up half of the total number snowspout

a winter waterspout also known as a snow devil an icespout an ice devil a snownado or a snowspout is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a  the term  winter waterspout  is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event very little is known about this phenomenon and only six known pictures of this event exist to date four of which were taken in  canada there are a couple of critical criteria for the formation of a winter waterspout very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water warm enough to produce  resembling  above the water s surface like the more efficient  events winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development climatology

though the majority of waterspouts occur in the tropics they can seasonally appear in temperate areas throughout the world and are common across the western coast of europe as well as the british isles and several areas of the mediterranean and baltic sea they are not restricted to saltwater  many have been reported on lakes and rivers including the  and the  waterspouts are fairly common on the great lakes during late summer and early fall with a record 66  waterspouts reported over just a seven-day period in 2003 they are more frequent within 100kilometers  60mi  from the coast than farther out at sea waterspouts are common along the southeast u.s coast especially off southern florida and the  and can happen over seas bays and lakes worldwide approximately 160 waterspouts are currently reported per year across europe with the netherlands reporting the most at 60 followed by spain and italy at 25 and the united kingdom at 15 they are most common in late summer in the northern hemisphere september has been pinpointed as the prime month of formation  waterspouts are frequently observed off the east coast of australia with several being described by  during the voyage of the  in 1770 life cycle 
there are five stages to the waterspout life cycle initially a prominent circular light-colored disk appears on the surface of the water surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape after the formation of these colored disks on the water a pattern of light and dark-colored spiral bands develop from the dark spot on the water surface then a dense  of sea spray called a cascade appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an  eventually the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud the spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves eventually the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens ending the waterspout s life cycle

marine hazard 
waterspouts have long been recognized as serious marine hazards stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft aircraft and people it is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena and to always be on alert through weather reports the united states  will often issue  when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters or  when waterspouts are expected to move onshore incidents of waterspouts causing severe damage and casualties are rare however there have been several notable examples the  in 1555 was the earliest record of a deadly waterspout it struck the  of valletta sinking four  numerous boats and claiming hundreds of lives the 1851  were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western sicily ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea a waterspout has been proposed as a possible reason for the inexplicable abandonment of the  threat to marine animals

depending on how fast the winds from a waterspout are whipping anything that is within about one yard of the surface of the water including fish of different sizes frogs and even turtles can be lifted into the air a waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish out of the water and all the way up into the cloud even if the waterspout stops spinning the fish in the cloud can be carried over land buffeted up and down and around with the clouds winds until its currents no longer keep the flying fish in the atmosphere depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into the atmosphere the fish are sometimes dead by the time they rain down people as far as 100 miles  160km  inland have experienced raining fish fish can also be sucked up from rivers but  is not a common weather phenomenon on september 28 2017 according to the  rain in  on northeastern  s  included fish research and forecasting 
szilagyi waterspout index  swi 
the szilagyi waterspout index  swi  developed by canadian meteorologist wade szilagyi is used to predict conditions favorable for waterspout development the swi ranges from 10 to  10 where values greater than or equal to zero represent conditions favorable for waterspout development international centre for waterspout research  icwr 
the icwr is a non governmental organization of individuals from around the world who are interested in the field of waterspouts from a research operational and safety perspective originally a forum for researchers and meteorologists the icwr has expanded interest and contribution from storm chasers the media the marine and aviation communities and from private individuals see also
