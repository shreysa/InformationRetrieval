proof of a program find a proof is given of the correctness of the algorithm find First, a informal description is given of the purpose of the program and the method used a systematic technique is described for constructing the program proof during the process of coding it in such a way as to prevent the intrusion of logical errors the proof of termination is treated as a separate exercise Finally, some conclusions relating to general programming methodology are drawn cacm January, 1971 Hoare, C.
