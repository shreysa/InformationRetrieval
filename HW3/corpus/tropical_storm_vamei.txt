on december 19 a small low-level circulation was located along the northwest coastline of   at the same time a plume of cold air progressed southward through the  on the southeastern periphery of a  over the  the vortex drifted southwestward reaching open water by december 21 the northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation and at the same time a portion of the air surge crossed the  the southerly flow turned eastward then northward and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex resulting in rapid  of the low-level circulation just a short distance north of the equator by december 25 an area of scattered  persisted about 370km  230mi  east of  within an area of low  in association with the low-level circulation continuing slowly westward the convection deepened and organized further and at 1200 on december 26 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230km  145mi  east of singapore or 156km  97mi  north of the equator this was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the equator the depression strengthened further and officially attained tropical storm status at 0000utc on december 27 based on the analysis by the   jma  though the   jtwc  unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior shortly thereafter an  with a 39km  24mi  diameter became apparent on satellite imagery along with  extending southward to the opposite side of the equator at 0600utc the jma first classified the system as tropical storm vamei about 65km  40mi  northeast of singapore and the agency estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85km h  50mph  at the same time however the jtwc upgraded vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 140km h  85mph  based on a  ship report from within the eye  a second ship reported wind gusts of 195km h  120mph  in the southern portion of the eyewall the storm was small and compact with gales extending about 45km  30mi  from its center at about 0830utc on december 27 vamei made  approximately 60km  35mi  northeast of singapore in the southeastern portion of the  state of  initially the   metmalaysia  classified the cyclone as a tropical storm though it was later re-assessed as a typhoon at landfall tropical storm vamei weakened quickly as it crossed the extreme southern portion of the malay peninsula and late on december 27 the jma downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the  the jtwc initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the center again approached land early on december 28 vamei moved ashore along northeastern  and at 0600utc the jma classified the storm as dissipated however convection persisted near the circulation over land believed to have been caused by the process known as upper-level  on december 29 what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern  in a post-season re-evaluation the jtwc classified the system as a continuation of vamei based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of vamei crossed sumatra without dissipating convection re-developed and late on december 30 the jtwc classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390km  245mi  west-southwest of the northwestern tip of sumatra  initially due to being treated as a separate system it was classified as tropical cyclone05b vamei quickly developed good  and organization though increased wind shear on december 31 rapidly weakened the storm  by late that day the center was exposed from the deep convection and vamei quickly dissipated unusual formation

vamei formed and reached tropical storm strength at  only 156km  97mi  from the equator this broke the previous record of typhoon sarah in the  which reached tropical storm strength at  due to a lack of  near the equator the formation of vamei was previously considered impossible however a study by the  indicated that the probability for a similar equatorial development was at least once every four centuries vamei developed in a vortex that appears every winter along the northwest coast of  and is maintained by the interaction between  and the local topography often the vortex remains near the coastline and in an analysis of 51winters only six reported the vortex as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more as the area in the south china sea between borneo and singapore is only 665km  415mi  wide a vortex needs to move slowly to develop a persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days which is needed to enhance the vortex is present on average nine days each winter the probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 1030percent thus the conditions which resulted in the formation of vamei are believed to occur once every 100400years preparations and impact

four days prior to vamei moving ashore the malaysian meteorological department  metmalaysia  issued storm advisories for potentially affected areas subsequently the agency issued warnings for heavy rainfall high winds and rough seas however few citizens knew of the passage of the rare storm offshore of malaysia two  ships in vamei s eyewall were damaged by strong winds upon moving ashore the storm brought  damage to portions of southeastern  vamei brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to portions of   and  as well as to  where rainfall reached over 200mm  8in  in  additionally monsoonal moisture influenced by the storm produced moderate to heavy precipitation across various regions of peninsular malaysia the passage of the cyclone resulted in flooding and mudslides which forced the evacuation of more than 13,195people in johor and  states into 69shelters along  the rainfall caused a landslide which destroyed four houses and killed five people river flooding was also reported as a result of the precipitation from vamei as well as previous rainfall damage from the flooding was estimated at 13.7million  2001  3.6million 2001usd  about 40percent of the damage occurred to crops at a farm in  moderate damage to transportation education and health-care facilities was also reported the malaysian government provided affected families up to rm5,000  2001myr  1,300 2001usd  in assistance for food clothing and repairs vamei also brought heavy rainfall to  which caused air traffic disruptions at the  the passage of the cyclone resulted in many downed trees in 2004 the name  vamei  was retired and replaced with  peipah  becoming the first retired name since the  began naming pacific typhoons in 2000 vamei was one of four tropical cyclones in the current naming list that was retired without attaining typhoon status  the others were  in 2006  in 2011 and sonamu in 2013 see also
