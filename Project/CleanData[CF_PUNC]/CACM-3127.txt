Thoth, a portable real-time operating system thoth isa real-time operating system which is designed to be portable over a large set of machines it is currently running on two minicomputers with quite different architectures both the system and application programs which use it are written in a high-level language because the system is implemented by the same software on different hardware it has the same interface to user programs Hence, application programs which use thoth are highly portable thoth encourages structuring programs as networks of communicating processes by providing efficient interprocess communication primitives cacm February, 1979 Cheriton, D.
