pre-colombian era 
the  were the first human inhabitants of hatteras island they established a settlement  village  known as croatoan on the island colonial era 
the story of  began when john white finally returned to roanoke on a fifth voyage to the colony a much-delayed re-supply mission arriving in 1590 at that time the settlement was found abandoned the only clue to the colonists  whereabouts was the word  croatoan  found carved into the palisade of the fort it is logical that the colonists left on roanoke had gone back to croatoan as they had already lived there and had had a strong relationship with the natives some of whom had visited england john white who made maps showing both croatoan and roanoke wrote in 1590 

i greatly joyed that i had safely found a certain token of their safe being at croatoan which is the place where manteo was born and the savages of the island our friends  

white had instructed them that if anything happened to them they should carve a  on a tree nearby indicating that their disappearance had been forced as there was no cross white took this to mean they had moved to  croatoan island   now known as hatteras island  upon finding the message of croatoan carved on the palisade white also wrote 

the next morning it was agreed by the captain and myself with the master and others to weigh anchor and go for the place at croatoan where our planters were for that then the wind was good for that place 
however he was unable to conduct a search as a massive storm was brewing and his men refused to go any further the next day they instead left the area without looking further for the colonists communities
