rainbands in advance of warm  and  are associated with weak upward motion and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature in an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical  narrow convective rainbands known as  generally in the  s warm sector ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts which tend to have more stratiform and less convective precipitation within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center in colder cyclones  or  bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone s comma head precipitation pattern with a width of 32 kilometres  20mi  to 80 kilometres  50mi  these bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogensis or zones of strengthening temperature contrast southwest of extratropical cyclones curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm  can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands which bring significant localized snowfall tropical cyclones

rainbands exist in the periphery of tropical cyclones which point towards the cyclone s center of  rainbands within tropical cyclones require ample moisture and a low level pool of cooler air bands located 80 kilometres  50mi  to 150 kilometres  93mi  from a cyclone s center migrate outward they are capable of producing heavy rains and  of wind as well as tornadoes particularly in the storm s right-front quadrant some rainbands move closer to the center forming a secondary or outer  within intense hurricanes spiral rainbands are such a basic structure to a tropical cyclone that in most  use of the satellite-based  is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone s  within this method the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the  and eyewall is used to assign a maximum sustained wind and a central pressure  values for their centers of  derived from this technique are approximate different programs have been studying these rainbands including  forced by geography 
convective rainbands can form parallel to terrain on its  side due to  triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud s formation their spacing is normally 5 kilometres  3.1mi  to 10 kilometres  6.2mi  apart when bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography a low-level barrier  forms parallel to and just prior to the mountain ridge which slows down the frontal rainband just prior to the mountain barrier if enough moisture is present  and  fronts can form convective rainbands sea breeze front  lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by evening the edge of  can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this interface downwind of islands bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges offshore  this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts references
