statistical guidance 




r-cliper for   2003 


the first statistical guidance used by the  was the hurricane analog technique  hurran  which was available in 1969 it used the newly developed  to find storms with similar tracks it then shifted their tracks through the storm s current path and used location direction and speed of motion and the date to find suitable analogs the method did well with storms south of the  which had not yet turned northward but poorly with systems near or after recurvature since 1972 the   cliper  statistical model has been used to help generate tropical cyclone track forecasts in the era of skillful dynamical forecasts cliper is now being used as the baseline to show model and forecaster skill the statistical hurricane intensity forecast  shifor  has been used since 1979 for tropical cyclone intensity forecasting it uses climatology and persistence to predict future intensity including the current  current cyclone intensity the cyclone s intensity 12hours ago the storm s initial latitude and longitude as well as its zonal  east-west  and meridional  north-south  components of motion a series of statistical-dynamical models which used regression equations based upon cliper output and the latest output from  models run at the national meteorological center then  were developed between the 1970s and 1990s and were named nhc73 nhc83 nhc90 nhc91 and nhc98 within the field of  despite the ever-improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power it was not until the decade of the 1980s when  showed  and until the 1990s when it consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models in 1994 a version of shifor was created for the northwest pacific ocean for  forecasting known as the statistical typhoon intensity forecast  stifor  which used the 19711990 data for that region to develop intensity forecasts out to 72hours into the future in regards to intensity forecasting the statistical hurricane intensity prediction scheme  ships  utilizes relationships between environmental conditions from the   gfs  such as vertical  and  climatology and persistence  storm behavior  via multiple regression techniques to come up with an intensity forecast for systems in the northern atlantic and northeastern pacific oceans a similar model was developed for the northwest pacific ocean and southern hemisphere known as the statistical intensity prediction system  stips  which accounts for land interactions through the input environmental conditions from the   nogaps  model the version of ships with an inland decay component is known as decay ships  dships  the logistic growth equation model  lgem  uses the same input as ships but within a simplified dynamical prediction system within  the rainfall climatology and persistence  r-cliper  model was developed using microwave rainfall data from polar orbiting satellites over the ocean and first-order rainfall measurements from the land to come up with a realistic rainfall distribution for tropical cyclones based on the national hurricane center s track forecast it has been operational since 2004 a statistical-parametric wind radii model has been developed for use at the national hurricane center and joint typhoon warning center which uses climatology and persistence to predict wind structure out to five days into the future dynamical guidance

during 1972 the first model to forecast storm surge along the  of the united states was developed known as the   splash  in 1978 the first hurricane-tracking model based on   the movable fine-mesh  mfm  model  began operating the quasi-lagrangian limited area  qlm  model is a multi-level primitive equation model using a  grid and the   gfs  for boundary conditions in the early 1980s the assimilation of satellite-derived winds from water vapor infrared and visible satellite imagery was found to improve tropical cyclones track forecasting the   gfdl  hurricane model was used for research purposes between 1973 and the mid-1980s once it was determined that it could show skill in hurricane prediction a multi-year transition transformed the research model into an operational model which could be used by the  for both track and intensity forecasting in 1995 by 1985 the sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes  slosh  model had been developed for use in areas of the  and near the united states  east coast which was more robust than the splash model the   bam  has been used operationally since 1987 using steering winds averaged through the 850 hpa to 200 hpa layer and the beta effect which causes a storm to drift northwest due to differences in the  across the tropical cyclone the larger the cyclone the larger the impact of the beta effect is likely to be starting in 1990 three versions of the bam were run operationally  the bam shallow  bams  average winds in an 850 hpa to 700 hpa layer the bam medium  bamm  which uses average winds in an 850 hpa to 400 hpa layer and the bam deep  bamd  which is the same as the pre-1990 bam for a weak hurricane without well-developed central thunderstorm activity bams works well because weak storms tend to be steered by low-level winds as the storm grows stronger and associated thunderstorm activity near its center gets deeper bamm and bamd become more accurate as these types of storms are steered more by the winds in the upper-level if the forecast from the three versions is similar then the forecaster can conclude that there is minimal uncertainty but if the versions vary by a great deal then the forecaster has less confidence in the track predicted due to the greater uncertainty large differences between model predictions can also indicate wind shear in the atmosphere which could affect the intensity forecast as well tested in 1989 and 1990 the vic ooyama barotropic  vicbar  model used a  representation of variables for the objective analysis of observations and solutions to the shallow-water prediction equations on nested domains with the boundary conditions defined as the global forecast model it was implemented operationally as the limited area sine transform barotropic  lbar  model in 1992 using the gfs for boundary conditions by 1990 australia had developed its own storm surge model which was able to be run in a few minutes on a personal computer the   jma  developed its own typhoon model  tym  in 1994 and in 1998 the agency began using its own dynamic  model

the   hwrf  model is a specialized version of the   wrf  model and is used to  the track and  of  the model was developed by the   noaa  the  the  and  it became operational in 2007 despite improvements in track forecasting predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge since statiscal methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance other than the specialized guidance global guidance such as the gfs   ukmet  nogaps japanese global spectral model  gsm   model france s action de recherche petite echelle grande echelle  arpege  and aire limitee adaptation dynamique initialisation  aladin  models india s   ncmwrf  model korea s global data assimilation and prediction system  gdaps  and regional data assimilation and prediction system  rdaps  models hong kong china s operational regional spectral model  orsm  model and canadian   gem  model are used for track and intensity purposes timeliness 
some models do not produce output quickly enough to be used for the forecast cycle immediately after the model starts running  including hwrf gfdl and fsse  most of the above track models  except cliper  require data from  such as the gfs which produce output about four hours after the  of 0000 0600 1200 and 1800 universal coordinated time  utc  for half of their forecasts the nhc issues forecasts only three hours after that time so some  early  models  nhc90 bam and lbar  are run using a 12-hour-old forecast for the current time  late  models such as the gfs and gfdl finish after the advisory has already been issued these models are  to the current storm position for use in the following forecast cycle  for example gfdi the interpolated version of the gfdl model consensus methods

using a consensus of forecast models reduces forecast error trackwise the guna model is a consensus of the interpolated versions of the gfdl ukmet with quality control applied to the cyclone tracker united states navy nogaps and gfs models the version of the guna corrected for model biases is known as the cgun the tcon consensus is the guna consensus plus the hurricane wrf model the version of the tcon corrected for model biases is known as the tccn a lagged average of the last two runs of the members within the tcon plus the ecmwf model is known as the tvcn consensus the version of the tvcn corrected for model biases is the tvcc consensus in early 2013 the  replaced the nogaps as the navy s primary operational global forecast model for the 2013 season and until model verification can occur it is not being utilized in the development of any consensus forecasts for intensity a combination of the lgem interpolated gfdl interpolated hwrf and dships models is known as the icon consensus the lagged average of the last two runs of models within the icon consensus is called the ivcn consensus across the northwest pacific and southern hemisphere a ten-member stips consensus is formed from the output of the nogaps gfs the japanese gsm the coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system  coamps  the ukmet the japanese tym the gfdl with nogaps boundary conditions the   afwa  model the australian tropical cyclone local area prediction system and the weber barotropic model ensemble methods 
no model is ever perfectly accurate because it is impossible to learn exactly everything about the atmosphere in a timely enough manner and atmospheric measurements that are taken are not completely accurate the use of the ensemble method of forecasting whether it be a multi-model ensemble or numerous ensemble members based on the global model helps define the uncertainty and further limit errors the jma has produced an 11-member ensemble forecast system for typhoons known as the typhoon ensemble prediction system  teps  since february 2008 which is run out to 132hours into the future it uses a lower resolution version  with larger grid spacing  of its gsm with ten perturbed members and one non-perturbed member the system reduces errors by an average of 40 kilometres  25mi  five days into the future when compared to its higher resolution gsm the florida state super ensemble  fsse  is produced from a suite of models which then uses statistical regression equations developed over a training phase to reduce their biases which produces forecasts better than the member models or their mean solution it uses 11global models including five developed at  the unified model the gfs the nogaps the united states navy nogaps the australian bureau of meteorology research centre  bmrc  model and canadian   rpn  model it shows significant skill in track intensity and rainfall predictions of tropical cyclones the systematic approach forecast aid  safa  was developed by the joint typhoon warning center to create a selective consensus forecast which removed more erroneous forecasts at a 72hour time frame from consideration using the united states navy nogaps model the gfdl the japan meteorological agency s global and typhoon models as well as the ukmet all the models improved during safa s five-year history and removing erroneous forecasts proved difficult to do in operations sunspot theory 
a 2010 report correlates low  activity with high  activity analyzing historical data there was a 25 chance of at least one hurricane striking the continental united states during a peak sunspot year  a 64 chance during a low sunspot year in june 2010 the hurricanes predictors in the us were not using this information hurricane forecast model accuracy 
the accuracy of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm for some storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are relatively straightforward and the models are not only accurate but they produce similar forecasts while for other storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are more complex and different models produce very different forecasts
