interval arithmetic determinant evaluation and its use in testing for a chebyshev system two recent papers one by hansen and one by hansen and R. R. Smith, have shown how interval arithmetic I. can be used effectively to bound errors in matrix computations in the present paper a method proposed by hasen and R. R. smith is compared with straightforward use of I. in determinant evaluation computational results show the accuracy and running times that can be expected when using I. for determinant evaluation an application using I. determinants in a program to test a set of functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented cacm February, 1969 Smith, L.
