the kilogram is one of the seven  and one of three which is defined ad hoc  i.e without reference to another base unit  

the standard   si  unit of mass is the   kg  the kilogram is 1000grams  g  first defined in 1795 as one cubic decimeter of water at the  of ice then in 1889 the kilogram was redefined as the mass of the  and as such is independent of the meter or the properties of water however the mass of the international prototype and its identical national copies have been found to be drifting over time it is expected that the  on may 20 2019 following a final vote by the  in november 2018 the new definition will use only invariant quantities of nature  the  the  and the  other units are accepted for use in si 

the   t   or  metric ton  is equal to 1000kg the   ev  is a unit of  but because of the  it can easily be converted to a unit of mass and is often used like one in this context the mass has units of ev c2  where c is the speed of light  the electronvolt and its multiples such as the mev  megaelectronvolt  are commonly used in  the   u  is 1 12 of the mass of a  atom approximately 69731660000000000001.661027kg the atomic mass unit is convenient for expressing the masses of atoms and molecules

definitions of mass 




the relation between properties of mass and their associated physical constants every massive object is believed to exhibit all five properties however due to extremely large or extremely small constants it is generally impossible to verify more than two or three properties for any object 
the   rs  represents the ability of mass to cause curvature in space and time the    represents the ability of a massive body to exert newtonian gravitational forces on other bodies inertial   m  represents the newtonian response of mass to forces   e0  represents the ability of mass to be converted into other forms of energy the    represents the quantum response of mass to local geometry 



in  one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven different aspects of mass or seven physical notions that involve the concept of mass every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be  and in some cases equal and this proportionality gives rise to the abstract concept of mass there are a number of ways mass can be measured or  

inertial mass is a measure of an object s resistance to acceleration when a  is applied it is determined by applying a force to an object and measuring the acceleration that results from that force an object with small inertial mass will accelerate more than an object with large inertial mass when acted upon by the same force one says the body of greater mass has greater  active gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object s   gravitational flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface  gravitational field can be measured by allowing a small  test object  to fall freely and measuring its  acceleration for example an object in free fall near the  is subject to a smaller gravitational field and hence accelerates more slowly than the same object would if it were in free fall near the earth the gravitational field near the moon is weaker because the moon has less active gravitational mass passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object s interaction with a  passive gravitational mass is determined by dividing an object s weight by its free-fall acceleration two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same acceleration  however the object with a smaller passive gravitational mass will experience a smaller force  less weight  than the object with a larger passive gravitational mass energy also has mass according to the principle of  this equivalence is exemplified in a large number of physical processes including   and the gravitational  pair production and nuclear fusion are processes in which measurable amounts of mass are converted to energy or vice versa in the gravitational bending of light photons of pure energy are shown to exhibit a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass curvature of  is a relativistic manifestation of the existence of mass such  is extremely weak and difficult to measure for this reason curvature was not discovered until after it was predicted by einstein s theory of general relativity extremely precise  on the surface of the earth for example are found to measure less time  run slower  when compared to similar clocks in space this difference in elapsed time is a form of curvature called  other forms of curvature have been measured using the  satellite quantum mass manifests itself as a difference between an object s quantum  and its  the quantum mass of an electron the  can be determined through various forms of  and is closely related to the  the  and the  the quantum mass of larger objects can be directly measured using a  in relativistic quantum mechanics mass is one of the irreducible representation labels of the poincar group 
weight vs mass 
main article  
in everyday usage mass and   are often used interchangeably for instance a person s weight may be stated as 75kg in a constant gravitational field the weight of an object is proportional to its mass and it is unproblematic to use the same unit for both concepts but because of slight differences in the strength of the  at different places the  becomes important for measurements with a precision better than a few percent and for places far from the surface of the earth such as in space or on other planets conceptually  mass   measured in   refers to an intrinsic property of an object whereas  weight   measured in   measures an object s resistance to deviating from its natural course of  which can be influenced by the nearby gravitational field no matter how strong the gravitational field objects in free fall are  though they still have mass the force known as  weight  is proportional to mass and  in all situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall for example when a body is at rest in a gravitational field  rather than in free fall  it must be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such as the  or the  this force keeps the object from going into free fall weight is the opposing force in such circumstances and is thus determined by the acceleration of free fall on the surface of the earth for example an object with a mass of 50kilograms weighs 491 newtons which means that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall by contrast on the surface of the moon the same object still has a mass of 50kilograms but weighs only 81.5newtons because only 81.5 newtons is required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon restated in mathematical terms on the surface of the earth the weight w of an object is related to its mass m by w   mg where g   70009806650000000009.80665m s2 is the acceleration due to   expressed as the acceleration experienced by a free-falling object  for other situations such as when objects are subjected to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface the weight force is proportional to the mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall which is called the  through such mechanisms objects in elevators vehicles centrifuges and the like may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects resulting from planetary surfaces in such cases the generalized equation for weight w of an object is related to its mass m by the equation w   ma where a is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity  again if gravity is the only influence such as occurs when an object falls freely its weight will be zero  macroscopically mass is associated with  although matter is not ultimately as clearly defined a concept as mass on the subatomic scale not only  the particles often associated with matter but also some  the particles that act as  have  another problem for easy definition is that much of the rest mass of ordinary matter derives from the binding energy  potential energy  holding their quarks together and other forms of energy rather than the sum of the rest masses of the individual particle constituents for example only 1 of the rest mass of matter is accounted for by the rest mass of its elementary quarks and electrons from a fundamental physics perspective mass is the number describing under which the  of the  of the  a particle transforms in the  of particle physics this symmetry is described as arising as a consequence of a coupling of particles with rest mass to a postulated additional  known as the  the total mass of the  is estimated at 1053kg corresponding to the rest mass of between 1079 and 1080  
inertial vs gravitational mass 
although inertial mass passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them in  newton s third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be identical  or at least proportional  but the classical theory offers no compelling reason why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass that it does is merely an empirical fact  developed his  starting from the assumption that this correspondence between inertial and  passive  gravitational mass is not accidental  that no experiment will ever detect a difference between them  the weak version of the   however in the resulting theory gravitation is not a force and thus not subject to newton s third law so  the equality of inertial and active gravitational mass    remains as puzzling as ever  the equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses is sometimes referred to as the  galilean equivalence principle  or the   the most important consequence of this equivalence principle applies to freely falling objects suppose we have an object with inertial and gravitational masses m and m respectively if the only force acting on the object comes from a gravitational field g combining newton s second law and the gravitational law yields the acceleration



this says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is equal to some constant k  all objects fall at the same rate in a given gravitational field this phenomenon is referred to as the  universality of free-fall   in addition the constant k can be taken to be 1 by defining our units appropriately 
the first experiments demonstrating the universality of free-fall were conducted by  it is commonly stated that galileo obtained his results by dropping objects from the  but this is most likely apocryphal  actually he performed his experiments with balls rolling down nearly frictionless  to slow the motion and increase the timing accuracy increasingly precise experiments have been performed such as those performed by  using the  pendulum in 1889 as of 2008 no deviation from universality and thus from galilean equivalence has ever been found at least to the precision 1012 more precise experimental efforts are still being carried out the universality of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the only acting force all other forces especially  and  must be absent or at least negligible for example if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on earth the feather will take much longer to reach the ground  the feather is not really in free-fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable to the downward force of gravity on the other hand if the experiment is performed in a  in which there is no air resistance the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time  assuming the acceleration of both objects towards each other and of the ground towards both objects for its own part is negligible  this can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump it is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum as  did on the surface of the  during  a stronger version of the equivalence principle known as the einstein equivalence principle or the strong equivalence principle lies at the heart of the  einstein s equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions of space-time it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field thus the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by a gravitational field is a result of the object s tendency to move in a straight line  in other words its inertia  and should therefore be a function of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field origin of mass

depiction of early  in the   dated to the  ca 1285 bc  the scene shows  weighing the heart of hunefer 

the concept of  is very old and  humans at some early era realized that the weight of a collection of similar objects was  to the number of objects in the collection 



where w is the weight of the collection of similar objects and n is the number of objects in the collection proportionality by definition implies that two values have a constant  

 or equivalently 

an early use of this relationship is a  which balances the force of one object s weight against the force of another object s weight the two sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational fields hence if they have similar masses then their weights will also be similar this allows the scale by comparing weights to also compare masses consequently historical weight standards were often defined in terms of amounts the romans for example used the  seed   or   as a measurement standard if an object s weight was equivalent to  then the object was said to weigh one roman pound if on the other hand the object s weight was equivalent to  then the object was said to weigh one roman ounce  uncia  the roman pound and ounce were both defined in terms of different sized collections of the same common mass standard the carob seed the ratio of a roman ounce  144 carob seeds  to a roman pound  1728 carob seeds  was

galileo galilei  1636 






distance traveled by a freely falling ball is proportional to the square of the elapsed time


sometime prior to 1638 galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of objects in free fall attempting to characterize these motions galileo was not the first to investigate earth s gravitational field nor was he the first to accurately describe its fundamental characteristics however galileo s reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would have a profound effect on future generations of scientists it is unclear if these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept or if they were real experiments performed by galileo but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and compelling a biography by galileo s pupil  stated that galileo had dropped  of the same material but different masses from the  to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass in support of this conclusion galileo had advanced the following theoretical argument  he asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of fall are tied by a string does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body  the only convincing resolution to this question is that all bodies must fall at the same rate a later experiment was described in galileo s two new sciences published in 1638 one of galileo s fictional characters salviati describes an experiment using a bronze ball and a wooden ramp the wooden ramp was  12 cubits long half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick  with a straight smooth polished  the groove was lined with   also smooth and polished as possible  and into this groove was placed  a hard smooth and very round bronze ball  the ramp was inclined at various  to slow the acceleration enough so that the elapsed time could be measured the ball was allowed to roll a known distance down the ramp and the time taken for the ball to move the known distance was measured the time was measured using a water clock described as follows 

 a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position  to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length  the water thus collected was weighed after each descent on a very accurate balance  the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many many times there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results 

galileo found that for an object in free fall the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time 



galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the earths gravitational field have a constant acceleration and galileos contemporary johannes kepler had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the influence of the suns gravitational mass however galileos free fall motions and keplers planetary motions remained distinct during galileos lifetime newtonian mass 




isaac newton 1689



 had published his concept of gravitational forces in 1674 stating that all  have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own centers and also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of their activity he further stated that gravitational attraction increases by how much nearer the body wrought upon is to their own center in correspondence with  from 1679 and 1680 hooke conjectured that gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance between the two bodies hooke urged newton who was a pioneer in the development of  to work through the mathematical details of keplerian orbits to determine if hooke s hypothesis was correct newton s own investigations verified that hooke was correct but due to personal differences between the two men newton chose not to reveal this to hooke isaac newton kept quiet about his discoveries until 1684 at which time he told a friend  that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits but had misplaced the solution in his office after being encouraged by halley newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his findings in november 1684 isaac newton sent a document to edmund halley now lost but presumed to have been titled   latin for  on the motion of bodies in an orbit  halley presented newton s findings to the  of london with a promise that a fuller presentation would follow newton later recorded his ideas in a three book set entitled   latin   mathematical principles of natural philosophy  the first was received by the royal society on 28 april 16856  the second on 2 march 16867  and the third on 6 april 16867 the royal society published newtons entire collection at their own expense in may 16867 31
isaac newton had bridged the gap between keplers gravitational mass and galileos gravitational acceleration resulting in the discovery of the following relationship which governed both of these 



where g is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of space where gravitational fields exist  is the gravitational mass   of the body causing gravitational fields and r is the radial coordinate  the distance between the centers of the two bodies  by finding the exact relationship between a body s gravitational mass and its gravitational field newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass the mass of the earth can be determined using kepler s method  from the orbit of earth s moon  or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the earth s surface and multiplying that by the square of the earth s radius the mass of the earth is approximately three millionths of the mass of the sun to date no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered newton s cannonball

main article  
newton s cannonball was a  used to bridge the gap between galileo s gravitational acceleration and kepler s elliptical orbits it appeared in newton s 1728 book a treatise of the system of the world according to galileo s concept of gravitation a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the earth however newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally  meaning sideways or perpendicular to earth s gravity  it follows a curved path  for a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path which by the projection alone it should have pursued and made to describe a curve line in the air  and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground and the greater the velocity is with which it is projected the farther it goes before it falls to the earth 513 newton further reasons that if an object were  projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain  with sufficient velocity  it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the earth and return to the mountain from which it was projected 




an apple experiences gravitational fields directed towards every part of the earth  however the sum total of these many fields produces a single gravitational field directed towards the earth s center


in contrast to earlier theories  e.g   which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material newton s theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced   every object has gravitational mass and therefore every object generates a gravitational field newton further assumed that the strength of each object s gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object if a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the earth or sun newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body 397 and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body s center 221
for example according to newton s theory of universal gravitation each carob seed produces a gravitational field therefore if one were to gather an immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere then the gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob seeds in the sphere hence it should be theoretically possible to determine the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a gravitational field similar to that of the earth or sun in fact by  it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass

measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in principle but extremely difficult in practice according to newton s theory all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous gravitating sphere however from a practical standpoint the gravitational fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure newton s books on universal gravitation were published in the 1680s but the first successful measurement of the earth s mass in terms of traditional mass units the  did not occur until 1797 over a hundred years later cavendish found that the earth s density was 5.448  0.033 times that of water as of 2009 the earth s mass in kilograms is only known to around five digits of accuracy whereas its gravitational mass is known to over nine significant figures 
given two objects a and b of masses ma and mb separated by a  rab newton s law of gravitation states that each object exerts a gravitational force on the other of magnitude

 
where g is the universal  the above statement may be reformulated in the following way  if g is the magnitude at a given location in a gravitational field then the gravitational force on an object with gravitational mass m is

 
this is the basis by which masses are determined by  in simple  for example the force f is proportional to the displacement of the  beneath the weighing pan as per  and the scales are  to take g into account allowing the mass m to be read off assuming the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance a  measures relative weight giving the relative gravitation mass of each object inertial mass 




massmeter a device for measuring the inertial mass of an astronaut in weightlessness the mass is calculated via the oscillation period for a spring with the astronaut attached  


inertial mass is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to acceleration this definition has been championed by  and has since been developed into the notion of  by  the simple  definition of mass is slightly different than the definition in the theory of  but the essential meaning is the same in classical mechanics according to  we say that a body has a mass m if at any instant of time it obeys the equation of motion



where f is the resultant  acting on the body and a is the  of the body s centre of mass for the moment we will put aside the question of what  force acting on the body  actually means this equation illustrates how mass relates to the  of a body consider two objects with different masses if we apply an identical force to each the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration we might say that the larger mass exerts a greater  resistance  to changing its state of motion in response to the force however this notion of applying  identical  forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is we can sidestep this difficulty with the help of  which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object it will experience an equal and opposite force to be precise suppose we have two objects of constant inertial masses m1 and m2 we isolate the two objects from all other physical influences so that the only forces present are the force exerted on m1 by m2 which we denote f12 and the force exerted on m2 by m1 which we denote f21 newton s second law states that



where a1 and a2 are the accelerations of m1 and m2 respectively suppose that these accelerations are non-zero so that the forces between the two objects are non-zero this occurs for example if the two objects are in the process of colliding with one another newton s third law then states that



and thus



if  a1  is non-zero the fraction is well-defined which allows us to measure the inertial mass of m1 in this case m2 is our  reference  object and we can define its mass m as  say  1kilogram then we can measure the mass of any other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and measuring the accelerations additionally mass relates a body s  p to its linear  v 

 
and the body s  k to its velocity 

 
the primary difficulty with mach s definition of mass is that it fails to take into account the   or   needed to bring two masses sufficiently close to one another to perform the measurement of mass this is most vividly demonstrated by comparing the mass of the  in the nucleus of  to the mass of the proton in free space  which is greater by about 0.239  this is due to the binding energy of deuterium  thus for example if the reference weight m2 is taken to be the mass of the neutron in free space and the relative accelerations for the proton and neutron in deuterium are computed then the above formula over-estimates the mass m1  by 0.239  for the proton in deuterium at best mach s formula can only be used to obtain ratios of masses that is as m1  m2    a2     a1  an additional difficulty was pointed out by  which is that the measurement of instantaneous acceleration is impossible  unlike the measurement of time or distance there is no way to measure acceleration with a single measurement  one must make multiple measurements  of position time etc  and perform a computation to obtain the acceleration poincar termed this to be an  insurmountable flaw  in the mach definition of mass atomic mass 
main article  
typically the mass of objects is measured in relation to that of the kilogram which is defined as the mass of the   ipk  a platinum alloy cylinder stored in an environmentally-monitored safe secured in a vault at the  in france however the ipk is not convenient for measuring the masses of atoms and particles of similar scale as it contains trillions of trillions of atoms and has most certainly lost or gained a little mass over time despite the best efforts to prevent this it is much easier to precisely compare an atom s mass to that of another atom thus scientists developed the   or dalton  by definition 1u is exactly one twelfth of the mass of a  atom and by extension a carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12u this definition however might be changed by the  which will leave the dalton very close to one but no longer exactly equal to it mass in relativity

in  there are two kinds of mass    invariant mass  and   which increases with velocity  rest mass is the newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object relativistic mass is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided by 2 the two are related by the following equation 



where  is the  



the invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames while the relativistic mass depends on the observer s  in order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values do not change between observers it is convenient to use rest mass the rest mass of a body is also related to its energy e and the magnitude of its momentum p by the  



so long as the system is  with respect to mass and energy both kinds of mass are conserved in any given frame of reference the conservation of mass holds even as some types of particles are converted to others matter particles  such as atoms  may be converted to non-matter particles  such as photons of light  but this does not affect the total amount of mass or energy although things like heat may not be matter all types of energy still continue to exhibit mass thus mass and energy do not change into one another in relativity  rather both are names for the same thing and neither mass nor energy appear without the other both rest and relativistic mass can be expressed as an energy by applying the well-known relationship  yielding  and  relativistic energy   total system energy  respectively 




the  relativistic  mass and energy concepts are related to their  rest  counterparts but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in systems where there is a net momentum because the relativistic mass is  it has gradually fallen into disuse among physicists there is disagreement over whether the concept remains useful  in bound systems the  must often be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the time it is bound the mass of the system changes in this process merely because the system was not closed during the binding process so the energy escaped for example the binding energy of  is often lost in the form of gamma rays when the nuclei are formed leaving  which have less mass than the free particles   of which they are composed  also holds in macroscopic systems for example if one takes exactly one kilogram of ice and applies heat the mass of the resulting melt-water will be more than a kilogram  it will include the mass from the    used to melt the ice  this follows from the  this number is small but not negligible  about 3.7 nanograms it is given by the  of melting ice  334 kj kg  divided by the speed of light squared  c2   91016 m2 s2  general relativity

a  or simply  is a  with an  mass although    that move   are a purely hypothetical concept not generally believed to exist  with imaginary mass have come to play an important  in modern physics and are discussed in popular books on physics under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories  the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals  there is no violation of   while the field may have imaginary mass any physical particles do not  the  imaginary mass  shows that the system becomes unstable and sheds the instability by undergoing a type of  called   closely related to second order phase transitions  that results in  in  of  the term   was coined by  in a 1967 paper but it was soon realized that feinberg s model in fact did not allow for  speeds instead the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration  any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons this process is known as tachyon condensation well known examples include the  of the  in  and  in  although the notion of a tachyonic  mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass the mass is not quantized rather the  is  even for tachyonic  the  at  separated points still  thus preserving causality therefore information still does not propagate faster than light and solutions grow exponentially but not superluminally  there is no violation of    drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared this is a special case of the general rule where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a  mass with the real part being their mass in the usual sense and the imaginary part being the  in  however in  a particle  a  one-particle state  is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time  i.e an  of the  an  is a state which is only approximately constant over time  if it exists long enough to be measured it can be formally described as having a complex mass with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part if both parts are of the same magnitude this is interpreted as a  appearing in a scattering process rather than a particle as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process in the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it in a  theory the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles  sometimes called   in discussions of tachyons  must also apply to tachyons in particular the

this equation shows that the total energy of a particle  bradyon or tachyon  contains a contribution from its rest mass  the  rest massenergy  and a contribution from its motion the kinetic energy when v is larger than c the denominator in the equation for the energy is  as the value under the  is negative because the total  must be  the numerator must also be imaginary  i.e the  m must be imaginary as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number exotic matter and negative mass

 when a distinction is necessary m is used to denote the active gravitational mass and m the passive gravitational mass  since the  na is defined as the number of atoms in 12g of carbon-12 it follows that 1u is exactly 1 103na kg  the distinction between  active  and  passive  gravitational mass does not exist in the newtonian view of gravity as found in  and can safely be ignored for many purposes in most practical applications newtonian gravity is assumed because it is usually sufficiently accurate and is simpler than general relativity  for example nasa uses primarily newtonian gravity to design space missions although  accuracies are routinely enhanced by accounting for tiny relativistic effects  the distinction between  active  and  passive  is very abstract and applies to post-graduate level applications of general relativity to certain problems in cosmology and is otherwise not used there is nevertheless an important conceptual distinction in newtonian physics between  inertial mass  and  gravitational mass  although these quantities are identical  the conceptual distinction between these two fundamental definitions of mass is maintained for teaching purposes because they involve two distinct methods of measurement it was long considered anomalous that the two distinct measurements of mass  inertial and gravitational  gave an identical result the property observed by galileo that objects of different mass fall with the same rate of acceleration  ignoring air resistance  shows that inertial and gravitational mass are the same  this constant ratio was later shown to be a direct measure of the sun s active gravitational mass  it has units of distance cubed per time squared and is known as the  




 at the time when viviani asserts that the experiment took place galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall he had however formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies of the same material falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed see drake s  1978  galileo at work  pp.1920   these two properties are very useful as they allow spherical collections of objects to be treated exactly like large individual objects  in its original form newton s second law is valid only for bodies of constant mass  it is possible to make a slight distinction between  rest mass  and  invariant mass  for a system of two or more particles none of the particles are required be at rest with respect to the observer for the system as a whole to be at rest with respect to the observer to avoid this confusion some sources will use  rest mass  only for individual particles and  invariant mass  for systems  for example a nuclear bomb in an idealized super-strong box sitting on a scale would in theory show no change in mass when detonated  although the inside of the box would become much hotter  in such a system the mass of the box would change only if energy were allowed to escape from the box as light or heat however in that case the removed energy would take its associated mass with it letting heat or radiation out of such a system is simply a way to remove mass thus mass like energy cannot be destroyed but only moved from one place to another
