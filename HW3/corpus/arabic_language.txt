arabian languages


arabia boasted a wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity in the southwest various  both belonging to and outside of the  family  e.g southern thamudic  were spoken it is also believed that the ancestors of the   non-central semitic languages  were also spoken in southern arabia at this time to the north in the oases of northern   and  held some prestige as inscriptional languages in  and parts of western arabia a language known to scholars as thamudic c is attested in eastern arabia inscriptions in a script derived from asa attest to a language known as  finally on the northwestern frontier of arabia various languages known to scholars as thamudic b thamudic d  and  are attested the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are in fact early forms of arabic and that they should be considered  beginning in the 1st century ce fragments of northern old arabic are attested in the  across northern arabia by the 4th century ce the nabataean aramaic writing system had come to express varieties of arabic other than that of the nabataeans old hijazi and classical arabic 
in late pre-islamic times a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of arabic emerged in the  which continued living its parallel life after literary arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the  most strongly in judeo-christian texts keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the  learned  tradition  classical arabic  this variety and both its classicizing and  lay  iterations have been termed middle arabic in the past but they are thought to continue an  register it is clear that the orthography of the  was not developed for the standardized form of classical arabic  rather it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of old higazi in the late 6th century ad a relatively uniform intertribal  poetic koine  distinct from the  developed based on the  dialects of  probably in connection with the court of  during the first islamic century the majority of arabic poets and arabic-writing persons spoke arabic as their mother tongue their texts although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts contain traces of non-standardized  elements in morphology and syntax the standardization of classical arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th century the first comprehensive description of the arabiyya  arabic   al-kitb is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts in addition to qur n usage and bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the arabiyya by the 8th century knowledge of classical arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the islamic world neo-arabic 
charles ferguson s  theory  ferguson 1959  claims that the modern arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the islamic conquests  this view has been challenged in recent times ahmad al-jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of arabic on the eve of the conquests  northern and central  al-jallad 2009  the modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories according to veersteegh and bickerton colloquial arabic dialects arose from pidginized arabic formed from contact between arabs and conquered peoples pidginization and subsequent creolization among arabs and  peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular arabic compared to classical and msa classical modern standard and spoken arabic

arabic usually designates one of three main variants    and  classical arabic is the language found in the  used from the period of  to that of the  theoretically classical arabic is considered normative according to the  and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians  such as   and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries  such as the   in practice however modern authors almost never write in pure classical arabic instead using a  with its own grammatical norms and vocabulary commonly known as modern standard arabic  msa  msa is the variety used in most current printed arabic publications spoken by some of the  across  and the  and understood by most educated arabic speakers  literary arabic  and  standard arabic    fu  are less strictly defined terms that may refer to modern standard arabic or classical arabic some of the differences between classical arabic  ca  and modern standard arabic  msa  are as follows 

certain grammatical constructions of ca that have no counterpart in any modern dialect  e.g the   are almost never used in  no modern spoken variety of arabic has  distinctions as a result msa is generally composed without case distinctions in mind and the proper cases are added after the fact when necessary because most case endings are noted using final short vowels which are normally left unwritten in the arabic script it is unnecessary to determine the proper case of most words the practical result of this is that msa like english and  is written in a strongly determined word order and alternative orders that were used in ca for emphasis are rare in addition because of the lack of case marking in the spoken varieties most speakers cannot consistently use the correct endings in extemporaneous speech as a result spoken msa tends to drop or regularize the endings except when reading from a prepared text the numeral system in ca is complex and heavily tied in with the case system this system is never used in msa even in the most formal of circumstances  instead a significantly simplified system is used approximating the system of the conservative spoken varieties 
msa uses much classical vocabulary  e.g dhahaba  to go  that is not present in the spoken varieties but deletes classical words that sound obsolete in msa in addition msa has borrowed or coined a large number of terms for concepts that did not exist in quranic times and msa continues to evolve some words have been borrowed from other languagesnotice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation  e.g  film  film  or  dmuqriyyah  democracy  however the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings preferring to either use   e.g  far  branch  also used for the branch of a company or organization   jan  wing  is also used for the wing of an airplane building air force etc  or to coin new words using forms within existing    istimtah   using the root  m w t  death  put into the  or  jmiah  university  based on  jamaa  to gather unite   jumhriyyah  republic  based on  jumhr  multitude  an earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse  e.g  htif  telephone     invisible caller  in sufism   jardah  newspaper     palm-leaf stalk  colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language and evolved from classical arabic colloquial arabic has many regional variants  geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be  and some linguists consider them distinct languages the varieties are typically unwritten they are often used in informal spoken media such as  and  as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertising the only variety of modern arabic to have acquired official language status is  which is spoken in  predominately    and written with the  it is descended from classical arabic through  but is not mutually intelligible with any other variety of arabic most linguists list it as a separate language rather than as a dialect of arabic

even during muhammad s lifetime there were dialects of spoken arabic muhammad spoke in the dialect of  in the western  and it was in this dialect that the quran was written down however the dialects of the eastern arabian peninsula were considered the most prestigious at the time so the language of the quran was ultimately converted to follow the eastern  it is this phonology that underlies the modern pronunciation of classical arabic the phonological differences between these two dialects account for some of the complexities of arabic writing most notably the writing of the  or   which was preserved in the eastern dialects but lost in western speech  and the use of alif maqrah  representing a sound preserved in the western dialects but merged with  in eastern speech  the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of  which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language usually in different social situations in the case of arabic educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught standard arabic as well as their native mutually unintelligible  dialects  these dialects linguistically constitute separate languages which may have dialects of their own when educated arabs of different dialects engage in conversation  for example a moroccan speaking with a lebanese  many speakers  back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or film the issue of whether arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged in the same way it is for the   and   and   and english etc in contrast to speakers of hindi and urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can speakers of the varieties of arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they cannot the issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor  a single written form significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms for political reasons arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions from a linguistic standpoint it is often said that the various spoken varieties of arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the  this is an apt comparison in a number of ways the period of divergence from a single spoken form is similarperhaps 1500 years for arabic 2000 years for the romance languages also while it is comprehensible to people from the  a linguistically innovative variety such as  is essentially incomprehensible to arabs from the  much as french is incomprehensible to spanish or italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them this suggests that the spoken varieties may linguistically be considered separate languages influence of arabic on other languages

the influence of arabic has been most important in islamic countries because it is the language of the islamic sacred book the quran arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as                                  and  as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken

arabic alphabet and nationalism 
there have been many instances of national movements to convert arabic script into latin script or to romanize the language currently the only arabic language to use latin script is  lebanon 
the beirut newspaper la syrie pushed for the change from arabic script to latin letters in 1922 the major head of this movement was  a french orientalist who brought his concern before the arabic language academy in damacus in 1928 massignon s attempt at romanization failed as the academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the western world to take over their country  a member of the academy mentioned that the movement to romanize the script was a  plan to dominate lebanon egypt 
after the period of colonialism in egypt egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and re-emphasize egyptian culture as a result some egyptians pushed for an egyptianization of the arabic language in which the formal arabic and the colloquial arabic would be combined into one language and the latin alphabet would be used there was also the idea of finding a way to use  instead of the latin alphabet but this was seen as too complicated to use a scholar  agreed with the idea of applying a latin alphabet to arabic as he believed that would allow egypt to have a closer relationship with the west he also believed that latin script was key to the success of egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology this change in alphabet he believed would solve the problems inherent with arabic such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for non-native speakers to learn ahmad lutfi as sayid and muhammad azmi two egyptian intellectuals agreed with musa and supported the push for romanization the idea that romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in egypt continued with abd al-aziz fahmi in 1944 he was the chairman for the writing and grammar committee for the arabic language academy of cairo however this effort failed as the egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the arabic alphabet in particular the older egyptian generations believed that the arabic alphabet had strong connections to arab values and history which is easy to believe due to the long history of the arabic alphabet  shrivtiel 189  in muslim societies the language of the quran and its influence on poetry

the quran inspired musicality in poetry through the internal rhythm of the verses the arrangement of words how certain sounds create harmony and the agreement of rhymes create the sense of rhythm within each verse at times the chapters of the quran only have the rhythm in common the repetition in the quran introduced the true power and impact repetition can have in poetry the repetition of certain words and phrases made them appear more firm and explicit in the quran the quran uses constant metaphors of blindness and deafness to imply unbelief metaphors were not a new concept to poetry however the strength of extended metaphors was the explicit imagery in the quran inspired many poets to include and focus on the feature in their own work the poet  wrote a book regarding the figures of speech inspired by his study of the quran opoets such as badr shakir al sayyab expresses his political opinion in his work through imagery inspired by the forms of more harsher imagery used in the quran the quran uses figurative devices in order to express the meaning in the most beautiful form possible the study of the pauses in the quran as well as other rhetoric allow it to be approached in a multiple ways structure 
although the quran is known for its  and  the structure can be best described as  the  also known as verses of the quran are not placed in chronological order the only constant in their structure is that the longest are placed first and shorter ones follow the topics discussed in the chapter often have no relation to each other and only share their sense of  the quran introduces to poetry the idea of abandoning order and scattering narratives throughout the text harmony is also present in the sound of the quran the elongations and accents present in the quran create a harmonious flow within the writing unique sound of the quran recited due to the  create a deeper level of understanding through a deeper emotional connection the quran is written in a language that is simple and understandable by people the simplicity of the writing inspired later poets to write in a more clear and clear-cut style the words of the quran although unchanged are to this day understandable and frequently used in both formal and informal arabic the simplicity of the language makes memorizing and reciting the quran a slightly easier task culture and the quran

different dialects of arabic 

colloquial arabic is a collective term for the spoken dialects of arabic used throughout the  which differ radically from the literary language the main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the arabian peninsula followed by that between  varieties and the much more conservative  varieties all of the varieties outside of the arabian peninsula  which include the large majority of speakers  have a large number of features in common with each other that are not found in classical arabic this has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige koine dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the arab conquest whose features eventually spread to all of the newly conquered areas  these features are present to varying degrees inside the arabian peninsula generally the arabian peninsula varieties have much more diversity than the non-peninsula varieties but have been understudied 
within the non-peninsula varieties the largest difference is between the non-egyptian   especially moroccan arabic  and the others moroccan arabic in particular is hardly comprehensible to arabic speakers east of   although the converse is not true in part due to the popularity of egyptian films and other media  one factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order  however a much more significant factor for most dialects is as among romance languages retention  or change of meaning  of different classical forms thus iraqi aku levantine fh and north african kayn all mean  there is  and all come from classical arabic forms  yakn fhi k in respectively  but now sound very different examples 
transcription is a  so minor differences were ignored for easier comparison also the  of  differs significantly from region to region 
koine 
according to  the following are some of the characteristic features of the  that underlies all of the modern dialects outside the arabian peninsula although many other features are common to most or all of these varieties ferguson believes that these features in particular are unlikely to have evolved independently more than once or twice and together suggest the existence of the koine 

loss of the  except on nouns with consistent plural agreement  cf feminine singular agreement in plural inanimates  change of a to i in many affixes  e.g non-past-tense prefixes ti yi ni  wi  and  il  the  feminineit in the   loss of third-weak verbs ending in w  which merge with verbs ending in y  reformation of geminate verbs e.g alaltu  i untied   alt u  conversion of separate words l  to me  laka  to you  etc into indirect-object  suffixes certain changes in the  system e.g khamsat ayym  five days   kham a s tiyym where certain words have a special plural with prefixed t loss of the feminine   comparative  adjective plurals of the form kibr  big   kubr change of  suffixiyy   i certain lexical items e.g jb  bring    ja bi  come with  shf  see  sh  what   or similar    ayyu shay  which thing  illi  relative pronoun  merger of   and

history 
of the 29 proto-semitic consonants only one has been lost     which merged with   but the consonant   is still found in many colloquial arabic dialects various other consonants have changed their sound too but have remained distinct an original  p  lenited to  f  and    consistently attested in pre-islamic greek transcription of arabic languages  became palatalized to   or   by the time of the quran and       or   in msa  see  for more detail  an original    became   its  counterpart   was considered by arabs to be the most unusual sound in arabic  hence the classical arabic s appellation   lughat al-d or  language of the d  for most modern dialects it has become an emphatic stop  d  with loss of the laterality or with complete loss of any pharyngealization or velarization  d   the classical d pronunciation of    still occurs in the  and the similar sound without velarization   exists in other  
other changes may also have happened classical arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different  of the sound system of proto-semitic propose different phonetic values one example is the emphatic consonants which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in proto-semitic reduction of  j  and  w  between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of third-weak  defective  verbs early akkadian transcriptions of arabic names shows that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st millennium bc the classical arabic language as recorded was a poetic  that reflected a consciously archaizing dialect chosen based on the tribes of the western part of the  who spoke the most conservative variants of arabic even at the time of muhammed and before other dialects existed with many more changes including the loss of most glottal stops the loss of case endings the reduction of the diphthongs  aj  and  aw  into monophthongs  e o  etc most of these changes are present in most or all modern varieties of arabic an interesting feature of the writing system of the quran  and hence of classical arabic  is that it contains certain features of muhammad s native dialect of mecca corrected through diacritics into the forms of standard classical arabic among these features visible under the corrections are the loss of the glottal stop and a differing development of the reduction of certain final sequences containing  j  evidently final awa  became  a  as in the classical language but final aja  became a different sound possibly  e   rather than again  a  in the classical language  this is the apparent source of the alif maqrah  restricted alif  where a final aja  is reconstructed  a letter that would normally indicate  j  or some similar high-vowel sound but is taken in this context to be a logical variant of alif and represent the sound  a  literary arabic 
the  colloquial  spoken varieties of arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of arabic speakers  formal    usually specifically modern standard arabic  is learned at school  although many speakers have a native-like command of the language it is technically not the native language of any speakers both varieties can be both written and spoken although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances e.g in radio broadcasts formal lectures parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial varieties even when the literary language is spoken however it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud when speaking   i.e making up the language on the spot as in a normal discussion among people  speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties in fact there is a continuous range of  in-between  spoken varieties  from nearly pure modern standard arabic  msa  to a form that still uses msa grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in msa to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the  rough edges   the most noticeably  vulgar  or non-classical aspects  smoothed out to pure colloquial the particular variant  or   used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation often it will vary within a single encounter e.g moving from nearly pure msa to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer this type of variation is characteristic of the  that exists throughout the arabic-speaking world

although modern standard arabic  msa  is a unitary language its pronunciation varies somewhat from country to country and from region to region within a country the variation in individual  accents  of msa speakers tends to mirror corresponding variations in the colloquial speech of the speakers in question but with the distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat note that it is important in descriptions of  arabic  phonology to distinguish between pronunciation of a given colloquial  spoken  dialect and the pronunciation of msa by these same speakers although they are related they are not the same for example the phoneme that derives from proto-semitic  g  has many different pronunciations in the modern spoken varieties e.g  d      j        speakers whose native variety has either  will use the same pronunciation when speaking msa even speakers from  whose native egyptian arabic has   normally use   when speaking msa the   of persian gulf speakers is the only variant pronunciation which isn t found in msa   d  is used instead another example  many colloquial varieties are known for a type of  in which the presence of an  emphatic consonant  triggers backed  of nearby vowels  especially of the low vowels  a  which are backed to  in all other circumstances  in many spoken varieties the backed or  emphatic  vowel allophones spread a fair distance in both directions from the triggering consonant  in some varieties  most notably egyptian arabic  the  emphatic  allophones spread throughout the entire word usually including prefixes and suffixes even at a distance of several syllables from the triggering consonant speakers of colloquial varieties with this vowel harmony tend to introduce it into their msa pronunciation as well but usually with a lesser degree of spreading than in the colloquial varieties  for example speakers of colloquial varieties with extremely long-distance harmony may allow a moderate but not extreme amount of spreading of the harmonic allophones in their msa speech while speakers of colloquial varieties with moderate-distance harmony may only harmonize immediately adjacent vowels in msa 
vowels 
modern standard arabic has six pure  with short  a i u  and corresponding long vowels  a i u  there are also two    aj  and  aw  the pronunciation of the vowels differs from speaker to speaker in a way that tends to reflect the pronunciation of the corresponding colloquial variety nonetheless there are some common trends most noticeable is the differing pronunciation of  a  and  a  which tend towards fronted    in most situations but a back   in the neighborhood of  some accents and dialects such as those of the  have central   in all situations the vowel  a  varies towards   too listen to the final vowel in the recording of al-arabiyyah at the beginning of this article for example the point is arabic has only three short vowel phonemes so those phonemes can have a very wide range of allophones the vowels  u  and   are often affected somewhat in emphatic neighborhoods as well with generally more back or centralized  but the differences are less great than for the low vowels the pronunciation of short  u  and  i  tends towards  o  and  i e  respectively in many dialects the definition of both  emphatic  and  neighborhood  vary in ways that reflect  to some extent  corresponding variations in the spoken dialects generally the consonants triggering  emphatic  allophones are the  consonants  t d s     and   if not followed immediately by  i  frequently the    x   also trigger emphatic allophones  occasionally also the       the former more than the latter  many dialects have multiple emphatic allophones of each vowel depending on the particular nearby consonants in most msa accents emphatic coloring of vowels is limited to vowels immediately adjacent to a triggering consonant although in some it spreads a bit farther  e.g  waqt   time   waan   homeland    was al-madnah  wstl-mdin   downtown   sometimes  wstl-mdin  or similar  in a non-emphatic environment the vowel  a  in the diphthong  aj  tends to be fronted even more than elsewhere often pronounced   hence  sayf  sajf   sjf   sjf   sword  but  ayf   summer  however in accents with no emphatic allophones of  a   e.g in the   the pronunciation  occurs in all situations consonants 

the phoneme  d  is represented by the arabic letter jm   and has many standard pronunciations   is characteristic of north algeria iraq also in most of the arabian peninsula but with an allophonic   in some positions    occurs in most of the  and most north africa  and   is used in most of egypt and some regions in yemen and oman generally this corresponds with the pronunciation in the colloquial dialects in some regions in sudan and yemen as well as in some sudanese and yemeni dialects it may be either  representing the original pronunciation of classical arabic foreign words containing   may be transcribed with       or  mainly depending on the regional spoken variety of arabic or the commonly diacriticized arabic letter note also that in northern egypt where the arabic letter jm   is normally pronounced   a separate phoneme   which may be transcribed with  occurs in a small number of mostly non-arabic loanwords e.g  akitta   jacket      can be pronounced as  in some places of maghreb it can be also pronounced as    x  and       are velar post-velar or uvular in many varieties         are actually       despite what is reported in many earlier works   l  is pronounced as velarized   in   allah  the name of god q.e  when the word follows a  u or   after i or  it is unvelarized    bismi llh  bismillah  some speakers velarize other occurrences of  l  in msa in imitation of their spoken dialects the emphatic consonant  d  was actually pronounced   or possibly either way a highly unusual sound the medieval arabs actually termed their language lughat al-d  the language of the    the name of the letter used for this sound  since they thought the sound was unique to their language  in fact it also exists in a few other minority semitic languages e.g mehri 
arabic has consonants traditionally termed  emphatic   t d s         which exhibit simultaneous   t d s   as well as varying degrees of   t d s   so they may be written with the  velarized or pharyngealized  diacritic      as   t d s   this simultaneous articulation is described as  retracted tongue root  by phonologists in some transcription systems emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter for example  d  is written d  in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it for example  vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long long   consonants are normally written doubled in latin transcription  i.e bb dd etc  reflecting the presence of the  mark shaddah which indicates doubled consonants in actual pronunciation doubled consonants are held twice as long as short consonants this consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive   qabila  he accepted  vs  qabbala  he kissed  
syllable structure 
arabic has two kinds of syllables  open syllables  cv  and  cvv and closed syllables  cvc   cvvc  and  cvcc  the syllable types with two   units of time  i.e cvc and cvv are termed  while those with three morae i.e cvvc and cvcc are  superheavy syllables in classical arabic occur in only two places  at the end of the sentence  due to  pronunciation  and in words such as  rr  hot   mddah  stuff substance   tajj  they disputed with each other  where a long  occurs before two identical consonants  a former short vowel between the consonants has been lost   in less formal pronunciations of modern standard arabic superheavy syllables are common at the end of words or before  suffixes such asn  us our  due to the deletion of final short vowels 
in surface pronunciation every vowel must be preceded by a consonant  which may include the    there are no cases of  within a word  where two vowels occur next to each other without an intervening consonant  some words do have an underlying vowel at the beginning such as the definite article al or words such as  ishtar  he bought   ijtim  meeting  when actually pronounced one of three things happens 

if the word occurs after another word ending in a consonant there is a smooth transition from final consonant to initial vowel e.g  al-ijtim  meeting   alidtima  if the word occurs after another word ending in a vowel the initial vowel of the word is  e.g   baytu  a l-mudr  house of the director   bajtulmudir  if the word occurs at the beginning of an utterance a glottal stop   is added onto the beginning e.g   al-baytu huwa   the house is    albajtuhuwa    
stress 
word stress is not phonemically contrastive in standard arabic it bears a strong relationship to vowel length the basic rules for modern standard arabic are 

a final vowel long or short may not be stressed only one of the last three syllables may be stressed given this restriction the last   containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant  is stressed if it is not the final syllable if the final syllable is super heavy and closed  of the form cvvc or cvcc  it receives stress if no syllable is heavy or super heavy the first possible syllable  i.e third from end  is stressed as a special exception in form vii and viii verb forms stress may not be on the first syllable despite the above rules  hence inkatab a   he subscribed   whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced  yankatib u   he subscribes   whether or not the final short vowel is pronounced  yankatib  he should subscribe  juss  likewise form viii ishtar  he bought  yashtar  he buys

levels of pronunciation 
the final short vowels  e.g the case endingsaiu and mood endingsua  are often not pronounced in this language despite forming part of the formal paradigm of nouns and verbs the following levels of pronunciation exist 
full pronunciation with  
this is the most formal level actually used in speech all endings are pronounced as written except at the end of an utterance where the following changes occur 

final short vowels are not pronounced  but possibly an exception is made for feminine pluralna and shortened vowels in the jussive imperative of defective verbs e.g irmi   throw  
the entire indefinite noun endingsin andun  with   are left off the endingan is left off of nouns preceded by a    i.e thet in the endingat that typically marks feminine nouns  but pronounced as  in other nouns  hence its writing in this fashion in the arabic script  the t marbah itself  typically of feminine nouns  is pronounced as h  at least this is the case in extremely formal pronunciation e.g some quranic recitations in practice this h is usually omitted 

formal short pronunciation 
this is a formal level of pronunciation sometimes seen it is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position  with influence from the   the following changes occur 

most final short vowels are not pronounced however the following short vowels are pronounced 

feminine pluralna
shortened vowels in the jussive imperative of defective verbs e.g irmi   throw 
second-person singular feminine past-tenseti and likewise anti  you  fem sg 
sometimes first-person singular past-tensetu
sometimes second-person masculine past-tenseta and likewise anta  you  masc sg 
finala in certain short words e.g laysa  is not  sawfa  future-tense marker 


the  endingsaninun are not pronounced however they are pronounced in adverbial accusative formations e.g taqrban   almost approximately  datan   usually  the  ending  is unpronounced except in  nouns where it sounds as t  and in adverbial accusative constructions e.g datan   usually  where the entiretan is pronounced  the masculine singular  endingiyy is actually pronounced  and is unstressed  but plural and feminine singular forms i.e when followed by a suffix still sound asiyy  full endings  including case endings  occur when a  object or  is added  e.gn  us our  
informal short pronunciation 
this is the pronunciation used by speakers of modern standard arabic in  speech i.e when producing new sentences rather than simply reading a prepared text it is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply even when a  suffix is added basically short-vowel case and mood endings are never pronounced and certain other changes occur that echo the corresponding colloquial pronunciations specifically 

all the rules for formal short pronunciation apply except as follows the past tense singular endings written formally astutati are pronouncedttti but masculine anta is pronounced in full unlike in formal short pronunciation the rules for dropping or modifying final endings are also applied when a  object or possessive suffix is added  e.gn  us our  if this produces a sequence of three consonants then one of the following happens depending on the speaker s native colloquial variety 

a short vowel  e.gi or   is consistently added either between the second and third or the first and second consonants or a short vowel is added only if an otherwise unpronounceable sequence occurs typically due to a violation of the   e.grtn is pronounced as a three-consonant cluster buttrn needs to be broken up  or a short vowel is never added but consonants like r l m n occurring between two other consonants will be pronounced as a   as in the english words  butter bottle bottom button  when a doubled consonant occurs before another consonant  or finally  it is often shortened to a single consonant rather than a vowel added  but note that moroccan arabic never shortens doubled consonants or inserts short vowels to break up clusters instead tolerating arbitrary-length series of arbitrary consonants and hence moroccan arabic speakers are likely to follow the same rules in their pronunciation of modern standard arabic 


the clitic suffixes themselves tend also to be changed in a way that avoids many possible occurrences of three-consonant clusters in particularkakihu generally sound asakikuh final long vowels are often shortened merging with any short vowels that remain depending on the level of formality the speaker s education level etc various grammatical changes may occur in ways that echo the colloquial variants 

any remaining case endings  e.g masculine plural nominativen vs obliquen  will be leveled with the oblique form used everywhere  however in words like ab  father  and akh  brother  with special long-vowel case endings in the  the nominative is used everywhere hence ab  father of  akh  brother of  
feminine plural endings in verbs and clitic suffixes will often drop out with the masculine plural endings used instead if the speaker s native variety has feminine plural endings they may be preserved but will often be modified in the direction of the forms used in the speaker s native variety e.gan instead ofna dual endings will often drop out except on nouns and then used only for emphasis  similar to their use in the colloquial varieties  elsewhere the plural endings are used  or feminine singular if appropriate

vowels 
as mentioned above many spoken dialects have a process of emphasis spreading where the  emphasis    of  spreads forward and back through adjacent syllables pharyngealizing all nearby consonants and triggering the back allophone   in all nearby  the extent of emphasis spreading varies for example in moroccan arabic it spreads as far as the first full vowel  i.e sound derived from a long vowel or diphthong  on either side  in many levantine dialects it spreads indefinitely but is blocked by any   or   while in egyptian arabic it usually spreads throughout the entire word including prefixes and suffixes in moroccan arabic  i u  also have emphatic allophones  e  and  o  respectively unstressed short vowels especially  i u  are deleted in many contexts many sporadic examples of short vowel change have occurred  especially  a i  and interchange  i u  most levantine dialects merge short  i u  into   in most contexts  all except directly before a single final consonant  in moroccan arabic on the other hand short  u  triggers  of nearby consonants  especially  and   and then short  a i u  all merge into   which is deleted in many contexts  the labialization plus   is sometimes interpreted as an underlying phoneme    this essentially causes the wholesale loss of the short-long vowel distinction with the original long vowels  a i u  remaining as half-long  phonemically  a i u  which are used to represent both short and long vowels in borrowings from literary arabic most spoken dialects have  original  aj aw  to  e o   in all circumstances including adjacent to emphatic consonants  in moroccan arabic these have subsequently merged into original  i u  consonants 
in some dialects there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above for example non-arabic   is used in the maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names semitic  extremely early on in arabic before it was written down  a few modern arabic dialects such as iraqi  influenced by persian and   distinguish between  the iraqi arabic also uses sounds     and uses persian adding letters e.g   gawjah  a plum   chimah  a truffle and so on early in the expansion of arabic the separate emphatic phonemes  many dialects  such as egyptian levantine and much of the maghreb  subsequently lost   converting  most dialects borrow  learned  words from the standard language using the same pronunciation as for inherited words but some dialects without interdental fricatives  particularly in egypt and the levant  render original  another key distinguishing mark of arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular plosives      proto-semitic   and  

   retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as yemen morocco and urban areas of the maghreb it is pronounced as a    in several  such as those spoken in cairo beirut and damascus but it is rendered as a voiced velar plosive   in persian gulf upper egypt parts of the maghreb and less urban parts of the levant  e.g jordan  in iraqi arabic it sometimes retains its original pronunciation and is sometimes rendered as a voiced velar plosive depending on the word some traditionally christian villages in rural areas of the levant render the sound as   as do shii bahrainis in some gulf dialects it is palatalized to  it is pronounced as a voiced uvular constrictive   in sudanese arabic many dialects with a modified pronunciation for   maintain the   pronunciation in certain words  often with religious or educational overtones  borrowed from the classical language   d  is pronounced as an affricate in iraq and much of the arabian peninsula but is pronounced   in most of north egypt and parts of yemen and oman   in morocco tunisia and the levant and    in most words in much of the persian gulf    usually retains its original pronunciation but is palatalized to   in many words in israel and the palestinian territories iraq and much of the arabian peninsula often a distinction is made between the suffixes ak   you  masc  and ik   you  fem  which become ak  and it  respectively in sana a omani and bahrani ik  is pronounced i  
pharyngealization of the emphatic consonants tends to weaken in many of the spoken varieties and to spread from emphatic consonants to nearby sounds in addition the  emphatic  allophone   automatically triggers pharyngealization of adjacent sounds in many dialects as a result it may difficult or impossible to determine whether a given  is phonemically emphatic or not especially in dialects with long-distance emphasis spreading  a notable exception is the sounds   vs   in moroccan arabic because the former is pronounced as an    but the latter is not

examples of how the arabic root and form system works 

main article  
literary arabic 
main article  
as in other semitic languages arabic has a complex and unusual   i.e method of constructing words from a basic   arabic has a   root-and-pattern  morphology  a root consists of a set of bare consonants  usually   which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words for example the word for  i wrote  is constructed by combining the root k-t-b  write  with the patterna-a-tu  i xed  to form katabtu  i wrote  other verbs meaning  i xed  will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants e.g qaratu  i read  akaltu  i ate  dhahabtu  i went  although other patterns are possible  e.g sharibtu  i drank  qultu  i said  takallamtu  i spoke  where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffixtu is always used  from a single root k-t-b numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns 

katabtu  i wrote 
kattabtu  i had  something  written 
ktabtu  i corresponded  with someone 
aktabtu  i dictated 
iktatabtu  i subscribed 
taktabn  we corresponded with each other

nouns and adjectives 
nouns in literary arabic have three grammatical     and    three   singular dual and plural  two   masculine and feminine  and three  states   indefinite definite and   the cases of singular nouns  other than those that end in long   are indicated by  short vowels u  for nominative a  for accusative i  for genitive  the feminine singular is often marked by at  which is reduced to ah  or a  before a pause plural is indicated either through endings  the   or internal modification  the   definite nouns include all proper nouns all nouns in  construct state  and all nouns which are  by the definite article  al  indefinite singular nouns  other than those that end in long   add a final n  to the case-marking vowels giving un  an  or in   which is also referred to as  or    in literary arabic are marked for case number gender and state as for nouns however the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective which takes the ah  or at  suffix  in literary arabic are marked for person number and gender there are two varieties independent pronouns and  enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns the first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs ni  and for nouns or prepositions    after consonants ya  after vowels  nouns verbs pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects however non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular furthermore a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun numerals between three and ten show  chiasmic  agreement in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa verbs 
verbs in literary arabic are marked for person  first second or third  gender and number they are  in two major paradigms   and   two   active and passive  and six       shorter  and longer energetic  the fifth and sixth moods the energetics exist only in classical arabic but not in msa there are also two   active and passive  and a  but no  the past and non-past paradigms are sometimes also termed  and  indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of  and  the moods other than the  occur only in the non-past and the  is signaled by prefixing sa or sawfa onto the non-past the past and non-past differ in the form of the stem  e.g past katab vs non-pastktub  and also use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person number and gender  in the past the person number and gender are fused into a single  morpheme while in the non-past a combination of   primarily encoding person  and suffixes  primarily encoding gender and number  are used the passive voice uses the same person number gender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem the following shows a paradigm of a regular arabic verb kataba  to write  note that in modern standard the energetic mood  in either long or short form which have the same meaning  is almost never used derivation 
like other  and unlike most other languages arabic makes much more use of   applying a large number of templates applied roots  to  words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words for verbs a given root can occur in many different   of which there are about fifteen  each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past stems active and passive participles and verbal noun these are referred to by western scholars as  form i   form ii  and so on through  form xv   although forms xi to xv are rare  these stems encode grammatical functions such as the   and  stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs albeit often semantically related and each is the basis for its own  paradigm as a result these derived stems are part of the system of  not part of the  system examples of the different verbs formed from the root k-t-b  write   usingm-r  red  for form ix which is limited to colors and physical defects 

form ii is sometimes used to create transitive   verbs built from nouns  form v is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives the associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in arabic this is similar to the process by which for example the english   meeting   similar to a verbal noun  has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social often work-related event where people gather together to have a  discussion   another lexicalized verbal noun  another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots such as the  nouns of location  in ma  e.g maktab  desk office    k-t-b  write  mabakh  kitchen   b-kh  cook  the only three genuine suffixes are as follows 

the feminine suffixah  variously derives terms for women from related terms for men or more generally terms along the same lines as the corresponding masculine e.g maktabah  library   also a writing-related place but different from maktab as above  the  suffixiyy this suffix is extremely productive and forms adjectives meaning  related to x  it corresponds to english adjectives inicalanyist etc the feminine  suffixiyyah this is formed by adding the feminine suffixah onto nisba adjectives to form abstract nouns for example from the basic root sh-r-k  share  can be derived the form viii verb ishtaraka  to cooperate participate  and in turn its verbal noun ishtirk  cooperation participation  can be formed this in turn can be made into a nisbah adjective ishtirk  socialist  from which an abstract noun ishtirkiyyah  socialism  can be derived other recent formations are jumhriyyah  republic   lit  public-ness    jumhr  multitude general public  and thespecific variation jamhriyyah  people s republic   lit  masses-ness    jamhr  the masses  pl of jumhr as above

the arabic alphabet derives from the aramaic through  to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of  or  to  traditionally there were several differences between the western  north african  and middle eastern versions of the alphabetin particular the fa had a dot underneath and qaf a single dot above in the maghreb and the order of the letters was slightly different  at least when they were used as numerals  however the old maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the maghreb itself and remains in use mainly in the quranic schools   of west africa arabic like all other semitic languages  except for the latin-written maltese and the languages with the   is written from right to left there are several styles of script notably  which is used in print and by computers and  which is commonly used in  calligraphy

there are a number of different standards for the  i.e methods of accurately and efficiently representing arabic with the latin script there are various conflicting motivations involved which leads to multiple systems some are interested in  i.e representing the spelling of arabic while others focus on  i.e representing the pronunciation of arabic  they differ in that for example the same letter  is used to represent both a consonant as in  you  or  yet  and a vowel as in  me  or  eat   some systems e.g for scholarly use are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of arabic generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the arabic script these systems are heavily reliant on  marks such as   for the sound equivalently written sh in english other systems  e.g the   are intended to help readers who are neither arabic speakers nor linguists with intuitive pronunciation of arabic names and phrases these less  scientific  tend to avoid  and use   like sh and kh  these are usually simpler to read but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems and may lead to ambiguities e.g whether to interpret sh as a single sound as in gash or a combination of two sounds as in gashouse the  romanization solves this problem by separating the two sounds with a  symbol      e.g ashal  easier  during the last few decades and especially since the 1990s western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world such as  the      and  most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin script only and some of them still do not have the arabic script as an optional feature as a result arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script sometimes known as im arabic to handle those arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the latin script numerals and other characters were appropriated for example the numeral  3  may be used to represent the arabic letter  there is no universal name for this type of transliteration but some have named it  other systems of transliteration exist such as using dots or capitalization to represent the  emphatic  counterparts of certain consonants for instance using capitalization the letter  may be represented by d its emphatic counterpart  may be written as d numerals 
in most of present-day north africa the   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  are used however in egypt and arabic-speaking countries to the east of it the                       are in use when representing a number in arabic the lowest-valued  is placed on the right so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right but numbers are spoken in the traditional arabic fashion with units and tens reversed from the modern english usage for example 24 is said  four and twenty  just like in the german language  vierundzwanzig  and  and 1975 is said  a thousand and nine-hundred and five and seventy  or more eloquently  a thousand and nine-hundred five seventy

in  arabic is largely used in educational settings 

historically arab linguists considered the arabic language to be superior to all other languages and took almost no interest in learning any language other than arabic  with the sole example of medieval linguist   who while a scholar of the arabic language was not ethnically arab  scholars of the arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics considering all other languages inferior in modern times the educated upper classes in the arab world have taken a nearly opposite view  wrote in 2011 that  studying and knowing english or french in most of the middle east and north africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and  feigning or asserting weakness or lack of facility in arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status class and perversely even education through a mlange of code-switching practises   professor franck salamah went as far as to declare arabic a dead language conveying dead ideas blaming its stagnation for arab intellectual stagnation and lamenting that great writers in arabic are judged by their command of the language and not the merit of the ideas they express with it see also
