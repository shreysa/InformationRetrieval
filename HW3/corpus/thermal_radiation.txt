overview 
thermal radiation is the emission of  from all matter that has a  greater than  it represents a conversion of  into  thermal energy consists of the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter all matter with a temperature by definition is composed of particles which have kinetic energy and which interact with each other these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles i.e  and  and kinetic interactions among matter particles result in charge-acceleration and  this results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields resulting in the emission of  radiating energy away from the body through its surface boundary electromagnetic radiation including light does not require the presence of matter to propagate and travels in the  of space infinitely far if unobstructed the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface it is emanating from including its temperature its spectral  and spectral emissive power as expressed by  the radiation is not monochromatic i.e it does not consist of just a single frequency but comprises a continuous dispersion of photon energies its characteristic spectrum if the radiating body and its surface are in  and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths it is characterized as a  a black body is also a perfect emitter the radiation of such perfect emitters is called  the ratio of any body s emission relative to that of a black body is the body s  so that a black body has an emissivity of unity absorptivity  and emissivity of all bodies are dependent on the wavelength of the radiation the temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation for example fresh snow which is highly reflective to visible light  reflectivity about 0.90  appears white due to reflecting sunlight with a peak wavelength of about 0.5 micrometers its emissivity at a temperature of about 5c  23f  peak wavelength of about 12 micrometers is 0.99 the distribution of power that a black body emits with varying frequency is described by  at any given temperature there is a frequency fmax at which the power emitted is a maximum wien s displacement law and the fact that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength indicates that the peak frequency fmax is proportional to the absolute temperature t of the black body the photosphere of the sun at a temperature of approximately 6000 k emits radiation principally in the  humanly  visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum earth s atmosphere is partly transparent to visible light and the light reaching the surface is absorbed or reflected earth s surface emits the absorbed radiation approximating the behavior of a black body at 300k with spectral peak at fmax at these lower frequencies the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from earth s surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere though some radiation escapes into space most is absorbed and then re-emitted by atmospheric gases it is this spectral selectivity of the atmosphere that is responsible for the planetary  contributing to  and  in general  but also critically contributing to climate stability when the composition and properties of the atmosphere are not changing  the  has a spectrum overlapping the black body spectra of the sun and the earth some of the photons emitted by a tungsten light bulb filament at  are in the visible spectrum most of the energy is associated with photons of longer wavelengths  these do not help a person see but still transfer heat to the environment as can be deduced empirically by observing an incandescent light bulb whenever em radiation is emitted and then absorbed heat is transferred this principle is used in   and  unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer thermal radiation can be concentrated in a tiny spot by using reflecting mirrors  takes advantage of this fact in many such systems mirrors are employed to concentrate sunlight into a smaller area instead of mirrors  can also be used to concentrate heat flux  in principle any kind of lens can be used but only the fresnel lens design is practical for very large lenses  either method can be used to quickly vaporize water into steam using sunlight for example the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the  and during the day it can heat water to 285c  558.15k  or 545f surface effects 
lighter colors and also whites and metallic substances absorb less illuminating light and thus heat up less  but otherwise color makes small difference as regards heat transfer between an object at everyday temperatures and its surroundings since the dominant emitted wavelengths are nowhere near the visible spectrum but rather in the far infrared emissivities at those wavelengths have little to do with visual emissivities  visible colors  in the far infra-red most objects have high emissivities thus except in sunlight the color of clothing makes little difference as regards warmth  likewise paint color of houses makes little difference to warmth except when the painted part is sunlit the main exception to this is shiny metal surfaces which have low emissivities both in the visible wavelengths and in the far infrared such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transfer in both directions  an example of this is the  used to insulate spacecraft  windows in houses are a more complicated technology since they must have low emissivity at thermal wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible light nanostructures with spectrally selective thermal emittance properties offer numerous technological applications for energy generation and efficiency e.g for cooling photovoltaic cells and buildings these applications require high emittance in the frequency range corresponding to the atmospheric transparency window in 8 to 13 micron wavelength range a selective emitter radiating strongly in this range is thus exposed to the clear sky enabling the use of the outer space as a very low temperature heat sink personalized cooling technology is another example of an application where optical spectral selectivity can be beneficial conventional personal cooling is typically achieved through heat conduction and convection however the human body is a very efficient emitter of ir radiation which provides additional cooling mechanism most conventional fabrics are opaque to ir radiation and block thermal emission from the body to the environment fabrics for personalized cooling applications have been proposed that enable ir transmission to directly pass through clothing while being opaque at visible wavelengths fabrics that are transparent in the infrared can radiate body heat at rates that will significantly reduce the burden on power-hungry air-conditioning systems properties 
there are four main properties that characterize thermal radiation  in the limit of the far field 

thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies the frequency distribution is given by  for an idealized emitter as shown in the diagram at top the dominant frequency  or color  range of the emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature of the emitter increases for example a red hot object radiates mainly in the long wavelengths  red and orange  of the visible band if it is heated further it also begins to emit discernible amounts of green and blue light and the spread of frequencies in the entire visible range cause it to appear white to the human eye  it is white hot even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 k 99 of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared this is determined by  in the diagram the peak value for each curve moves to the left as the temperature increases the total amount of radiation of all frequencies increases steeply as the temperature rises  it grows as t4 where t is the absolute temperature of the body an object at the temperature of a kitchen oven about twice the room temperature on the absolute temperature scale  600 k vs 300 k  radiates 16 times as much power per unit area an object at the temperature of the filament in an roughly 3000 k or 10 times room temperatureradiates 10,000 times as much energy per unit area the total radiative intensity of a black body rises as the fourth power of the absolute temperature as expressed by the  in the plot the area under each curve grows rapidly as the temperature increases the rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted at a given frequency is proportional to the amount of absorption that it would experience by the source thus a surface that absorbs more red light thermally radiates more red light this principle applies to all properties of the wave including   color  direction  and even  so that it is quite possible to have thermal radiation which is polarized coherent and directional though polarized and coherent forms are fairly rare in nature far from sources  in terms of wavelength  see section below for more on this qualification 
near-field and far-field 
the general properties of thermal radiation as described by the planck s law apply if the linear dimension of all parts considered as well as radii of curvature of all surfaces are large compared with the wavelength of the ray considered   typically from 8-25 micrometres for the emitter at 300 k  indeed thermal radiation as discussed above takes only radiating waves  far-field or   into account a more sophisticated framework involving electromagnetic theory must be used for smaller distances from the thermal source or surface   for example although  thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent near-field thermal radiation  i.e radiation at distances of a fraction of various radiation wavelengths  may exhibit a degree of both temporal and spatial coherence planck s law of thermal radiation has been challenged in recent decades by predictions and successful demonstrations of the radiative heat transfer between objects separated by nanoscale gaps that deviate significantly from the law predictions this deviation is especially strong  up to several orders in magnitude  when the emitter and absorber support surface polariton modes that can couple through the gap separating cold and hot objects however to take advantage of the surface-polariton-mediated near-field radiative heat transfer the two objects need to be separated by ultra-narrow gaps on the order of microns or even nanometers this limitation significantly complicates practical device designs another way to modify the object thermal emission spectrum is by reducing the dimensionality of the emitter itself this approach builds upon the concept of confining electrons in quantum wells wires and dots and tailors thermal emission by engineering confined photon states in two and three-dimensional potential traps including wells wires and dots such spatial confinement concentrates photon states and enhances thermal emission at select frequencies to achieve the required level of photon confinement the dimensions of the radiating objects should be on the order of or below the thermal wavelength predicted by planck s law most importantly the emission spectrum of thermal wells wires and dots deviates from planck s law predictions not only in the near field but also in the far field which significantly expands the range of their applications subjective color to the eye of a black body thermal radiator

thermal radiation is one of the principal mechanisms of  it entails the emission of a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation due to an object s temperature other mechanisms are  and  the interplay of energy exchange by thermal radiation is characterized by the following equation 



here  represents the spectral absorption component  spectral reflection component and  the spectral transmission component these elements are a function of the wavelength   of the electromagnetic radiation the spectral absorption is equal to the    this relation is known as  an object is called a black body if for all frequencies the following formula applies 



in a practical situation and room-temperature setting humans lose considerable energy due to thermal radiation the energy lost by emitting  radiation is partially regained by absorbing the heat flow due to conduction from surrounding objects and the remainder resulting from generated heat through metabolism human skin has an emissivity of very close to 1.0 using the formulas below shows a human having roughly 2 square meter in surface area and a temperature of about 307 continuously radiates approximately 1000watts if people are indoors surrounded by surfaces at 296k they receive back about 900watts from the wall ceiling and other surroundings so the net loss is only about 100watts these heat transfer estimates are highly dependent on extrinsic variables such as wearing clothes i.e decreasing total thermal circuit conductivity therefore reducing total output heat flux only truly gray systems  relative equivalent emissivity absorptivity and no directional transmissivity dependence in all control volume bodies considered  can achieve reasonable steady-state heat flux estimates through the stefan-boltzmann law encountering this  ideally calculable  situation is almost impossible  although common engineering procedures surrender the dependency of these unknown variables and  assume  this to be the case  optimistically these  gray  approximations will get close to real solutions as most divergence from stefan-boltzmann solutions is very small  especially in most  lab controlled environments  if objects appear white  reflective in the   they are not necessarily equally reflective  and thus non-emissive  in the thermal infrared most household radiators are painted white but this is sensible given that they are not hot enough to radiate any significant amount of heat and are not designed as thermal radiators at all  they are actually convectors and painting them matt black would make little difference to their efficacy acrylic and urethane based white paints have 93 blackbody radiation efficiency at room temperature  meaning the term  black body  does not always correspond to the visually perceived color of an object  these materials that do not follow the  black color   high emissivity absorptivity  caveat will most likely have functional spectral emissivity absorptivity dependence calculation of radiative heat transfer between groups of object including a  cavity  or  surroundings  requires solution of a set of  using the  method in these calculations the geometrical configuration of the problem is distilled to a set of numbers called  which give the proportion of radiation leaving any given surface that hits another specific surface these calculations are important in the fields of   and  design and  







a comparison of a thermal image  top  and an ordinary photograph  bottom  shows that a trash bag is transparent but glass  the man s spectacles  is opaque in long-wavelength infrared 

a selective surface can be used when energy is being extracted from the sun for instance when a green house is made most of the roof and walls are made out of glass glass is transparent in the visible  approximately 0.4m 0.8m  and  wavelengths but opaque to mid to far-wavelength infrared  approximately  3m  therefore glass lets in radiation in the visible range allowing us to be able to see through it but does not let out radiation that is emitted from objects at or close to room temperature this traps what we feel as heat this is known as the greenhouse effect and can be observed by getting into a car that has been sitting in the sun  selective surfaces can also be used on solar collectors we can find out how much help a selective surface coating is by looking at the equilibrium temperature of a plate that is being heated through solar radiation if the plate is receiving a solar irradiation of 1350w m  minimum is 1325w m on july4 and maximum is 1418w m on january3  from the sun the temperature of the plate where the radiation leaving is equal to the radiation being received by the plate is 393k  248f  if the plate has a selective surface with an emissivity of 0.9 and a cut off wavelength of 2.0m the equilibrium temperature is approximately 1250k  1790f  the calculations were made neglecting convective heat transfer and neglecting the solar irradiation absorbed in the clouds atmosphere for simplicity the theory is still the same for an actual problem to reduce the heat transfer from a surface such as a glass window a clear reflective film with a low emissivity coating can be placed on the interior of the surface low-emittance  low-e  coatings are microscopically thin virtually invisible metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the u-factor by suppressing radiative heat flow by adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the window radiative power

thermal radiation power of a black body per unit area of radiating surface per unit of  and per unit   is given by  as 



or in terms of wavelength



where  is a constant this formula mathematically follows from calculation of spectral distribution of energy in  electromagnetic field which is in complete  with the radiating object the equation is derived as an infinite sum over all possible frequencies the energy  of each photon is multiplied by the number of states available at that frequency and the probability that each of those states will be occupied integrating the above equation over  the power output given by the  is obtained as 



where the   is the  and  is the radiating surface area the wavelength  for which the emission intensity is highest is given by  as 



for surfaces which are not black bodies one has to consider the  generally frequency dependent  emissivity factor  this factor has to be multiplied with the radiation spectrum formula before integration if it is taken as a constant the resulting formula for the power output can be written in a way that contains  as a factor 



this type of theoretical model with frequency-independent emissivity lower than that of a perfect black body is often known as a grey body for frequency-dependent emissivity the solution for the integrated power depends on the functional form of the dependence though in general there is no simple expression for it practically speaking if the emissivity of the body is roughly constant around the peak emission wavelength the gray body model tends to work fairly well since the weight of the curve around the peak emission tends to dominate the integral constants
