hurricane elena was an unpredictable and damaging  that affected eastern and central portions of the  in late august and early september 1985 threatening popular tourist destinations during  elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent the hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern  and eastern  though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas elena developed on august 28 near  and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact it entered the  and continued to strengthen initially projected to strike the central gulf coast the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on august 30 then stalled just 50mi  80km  west of  despite predictions that elena would continue eastward across florida the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making  near  on september 2 as a  major hurricane the storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on september 4 the hurricane s unpredictable shifts in direction created what was considered the largest peacetime evacuation in the nation s history evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storm s forecast positions and many residents and tourists along portions of the gulf coast were forced to leave twice in a matter of days preparations were generally timely and efficient though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin and many refugees tried to return home against officials  orders about 1.25 million people fled the storm in florida alone contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees  were continuously issued and adjusted and forecasters stressed the storm s destructive potential for days elena s slow movement off western florida resulted in severe  and damage to coastal buildings roads and  especially to those of old or inadequate construction destruction was greatest near the shore and on islands such as cedar key and  though tornadoes spawned by the hurricane swept through communities and mobile home parks well inland the hurricane devastated the  shellfish industry killing large quantities of oysters destroying their reefs and leaving thousands of workers unemployed farther west  in alabama endured wind gusts as high as 130mph  210km h  and a significant storm surge the island sustained some of the most significant damage inflicted by elena including several hundred damaged or demolished homes the rest of the state s coast also sustained considerable damage and the inland pecan and soybean crops were severely diminished in alabama and mississippi over 13,000 homes were damaged in mississippi and 200 were destroyed cities close to the alabama borderincluding experienced widespread damage to residences schools and businesses and the community of  was effectively isolated from the outside world several apparent but unconfirmed tornadoes appear to have exacerbated the damage in the  area wind damage extended into portions of eastern louisiana overall nine people died as a result of the hurricane  two in  due to drownings in rip currents three in florida two in louisiana one in  and one in a maritime accident in the gulf of mexico damage totaled about  1.3 billion and power outages from the storm affected 550,000 people in elena s wake president  declared parts of alabama mississippi and florida federal disaster areas making storm victims eligible for financial aid and temporary housing the name elena was later retired from the cyclical list of atlantic hurricane names because of the storm s effects

meteorological history 




map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the 


the origins of hurricane elena trace to an easterly  that was first identified off the western coast of africa on august 23 1985 the system sped westward across the atlantic at up to 35mph  56km h  its rapid motion combined with the presence of an unusually hostile  prevented  for several days driven by a strong subtropical  to its north the wave quickly approached north america as it began to show signs of organization at 00 00  on august 28 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression while over the  the newly designated depression began to track west-northwestward over  which is known to disrupt tropical cyclone development despite that its central  continued to deepen and  found winds exceeding 50mph  80km h  near the center in response the  upgraded the depression to tropical storm elena over northern cuba later on august 28 after passing north of  cuba elena emerged into the  at 12 00 utc on august 29 elena intensified into a  analysis of steering currents through the morning of august 30 suggested that elena would continue on its northwestward track striking the area between  and biloxi mississippi within 30 hours unexpectedly a mid-to-upper-level  of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents allowing elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity the storm abruptly turned east in response to the trough having defied initial forecasts hurricane elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest  forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the florida peninsula and into the western atlantic however the relatively weak trough moved rapidly and instead of fully engaging elena its axis passed over the storm s center further post-storm analysis of  imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments

extrapolation from the storm s eastward progress yielded a projected landfall location near  however after the passage of the upper-level system early on august 31 steering currents slackened and elena became nearly stationary in the extreme northeastern gulf of mexico at its closest the center of the storm was around 50mi  80km  from  with  estimated at 105mph  170km h  elena s intensity remained consistent and the cyclone was able to continue strengthening as soon as movement resumed early on september 1 elena reached category 3 major hurricane status an area of  soon began to build over the eastern united states causing elena to slowly retrograde westward for much of september 1 the center of the hurricane was within range of the  radar station in  enabling extensive study of small features within the  and surrounding eyewall during that period of observation the previously unobstructed eye became cloud-filled the hurricane accelerated on a trajectory toward the central  sliding south of the  during the afternoon of september 1 the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 125mph  205km h  as confirmed by reconnaissance aircraft on the morning of september 2 elena approached coastal mississippi from the east-southeast still at major hurricane status it  close to biloxi which was coincidentally within the hurricane s first forecast destination range before its extended detour once inland the hurricane immediately deteriorated weakening to a tropical storm just hours after landfall and its center rapidly  the system curved northwestward over  and  and despite weakening it continued to ignite  which spawned heavy rains elena persisted for several days before degenerating into a remnant area of low pressure on september 4 its associated cloud structure became distorted on september 5 and dissipated over  that same night preparations 
the unpredictable nature of the hurricane in conjunction with its arrival at popular tourist destinations on the  holiday weekend severely complicated preparations along the gulf coast evacuations and the hoisting of weather advisories inadvertently occurred in stages to keep up with elena s shifts in direction   were in effect at one point or another for every coastal location between  and  much of the northern gulf coast was under a hurricane warning on two separate occasions for two different trajectories of the storm evacuations of residents and vacationers also overlapped in many cases collectively this led to the  largest number of people ever evacuated  according to  some evacuees moved inland to meet relatives but many stayed relatively local filling hotels and designated shelters such as schools and churches despite the unusually fluid scenario officials were well aware of the storm s destructive power days before its actual landfall national hurricane center hurricane expert  cautioned on august 30 that elena  will be over a  1 billion storm  



hurricane elena early on september 1 shortly before attaining peak intensity and accelerating to the west


during elena s initial approach the first series of hurricane warnings were issued between  and apalachicola florida the storm s projected path quickly nudged westward prompting the warnings to be extended to morgan city louisiana and truncated to  on their eastern reach heeding the advisories nearly one million residents and vacationers fled the storm s path personnel on offshore oil rigs in the northern gulf of mexico began leaving as early as august 29 the governors of    and  declared states of emergency by august 30 huge crowds formed at stores as individuals searched for emergency supplies and simultaneously lines grew at gas stations due to the impending danger many businesses closed and fortified their buildings across the gulf coast classes at schools were cancelled and residents in the new orleans area were particularly wary of what was being called the first serious hurricane threat in 20 years   caused catastrophic flooding in and around new orleans in 1965  in mississippi the mass exodus created bumper-to-bumper traffic on crucial highways such as the westeast  in florida then-governor  activated 250 national guard troops on august 30 to facilitate efficient evacuations stating that 1,600 more were on standby by that time it became evident that elena would head farther east than initially expected stirring more concern for the eastern gulf coast accordingly hurricane warnings were dropped for coastal louisiana west of grand isle and replaced eastward to apalachicola florida by the evening of august 30 after elena s sharp turn to the east hurricane warnings along most of the northern gulf coast were discontinued in accordance evacuees between louisiana and the four westernmost counties of the florida panhandle returned home as shelters closed with the storm s new course the area of highest threat translated east to the remainder of the panhandle and the western florida peninsula as such governor graham recommended evacuations south to the  area late on august 30 a mandatory evacuation was then issued overnight for ten more coastal counties encompassing 573,000 affected individuals on august 31 governor graham advised residents in vulnerable areas of 15 inland counties to find safer ground in response to the heightening danger most of the national guard troops previously on standby were sent to block access to certain areas and an additional 3,000 were placed on standby in the greater  pinellas county area alone 320,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history the large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities highways and contingencies although the number of people required to leave far exceeded the capacity of pinellas county shelters only 120,000 of the 300,000 or more refugees made use of the shelters still official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives or increased awareness of available resources post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90 in pinellas county and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours rather than the expected 15 with over 200,000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central florida evacuees became restless as a result of the duration of the storm supplies such as food ran short and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely the threat of hurricane elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients  at 84 of patient capacity was evacuated  four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in pinellas county were also cleared overall nearly 2,000 nursing home patients were transported to safety although successful the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages late on september 1 when the storm began to retrograde hurricane warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to grand isle louisiana as advisories along the west coast of the florida peninsula were allowed to expire by the time officials lifted evacuation orders the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety roughly 250,000 people in the florida panhandle 175,000 in alabama 70,000 in mississippi and 50,000 in louisianaa total of 545,000were ordered to leave several hundred thousand of the people affected by the new string of evacuation orders had also been forced to leave just days earlier and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve governor graham s office reported that during the entire storm event 1.25 million people from florida evacuated at some point and state police in louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400,000 in total nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire course impact 
according to the  of the  hurricane elena produced category 3 winds  111mph  179km h  or greater  in florida alabama and mississippi the  reported that in addition to the hundreds of single-family homes demolished by the hurricane over 17,000 sustained some degree of damage  thousands of mobile homes apartments and condominiums were also damaged or destroyed a forecaster at the national hurricane center determined the worst of the hurricane s effects were focused around  and pascagoula mississippi though noteworthy damage occurred across large areas of louisiana mississippi alabama and florida with effects documented as far west as  and as far north as  nine deaths were attributed to the hurricane in four states and on the waters of the gulf of mexico and 134 people along elena s path were hospitalized many of them due to storm-related stress power outages plagued the entire region affecting about 550,000 customers the  compiled a total monetary damage figure of  1.3 billion in addition to its effects over land elena also affected offshore interests when a cargo ship close to the hurricane s center rolled in high seas on august 29 two unsecured storage containers collided crushing a man to death an  operated by  and anchored off the coast of pensacola florida was ripped from its moorings and reported missing on september 2 the oil rig drifted 14mi  23km  away before it was spotted by a coast guard aircraft exxon previously evacuated the platform after rough seas snapped the first two of its eight anchoring cables damage was reported on four other offshore platforms and a 6in  150mm  oil pipeline broke during the hurricane at an estimated cost of  1.6 million  the same pipeline broke two more times during the 1985 hurricane season  a large aspect of the hurricane s devastation was the havoc it wrought on the eastern gulf of mexico  industry particularly in the  area and off the coast of alabama elena subjected the apalachicola bay reefs to high winds strong tidal action and moderate to heavy rainfall churning up huge quantities of silt and mud which suffocated up to 90 of live oysters and virtually destroyed the most important harvesting sites commercial harvesting was suspended until may 1986 at which time some of the prominent reefs of the eastern apalachicola bay system were deemed able to sustain oyster-catching low astronomical tides amplified the effects of severe turbulence in the water thousands of individuals relying on the apalachicola bay oyster industry soon found themselves struggling to make a living  losses in production at two major reefs were expected to surpass  30 million all of alabama s major reefs were affected by the hurricane and its most productive was nearly destroyed the problem was later confounded in november by hurricane kate which according to the national hurricane center   the final blow  to certain oyster beds florida 




numerous coastal roads such as this one along the gulf coast of florida were damaged by the hurricane s storm surge 

the storm began affecting florida late on august 28 and early on august 29 in  on the east side of elena s strengthening center wind gusts exceeded 50mph  80km h  accompanied by 1.8in  46mm  of rain and higher-than-normal tides several boats washed ashore at  similarly adverse conditions occurred throughout rest of the  and across the southern florida peninsula  60mph  100km h  wind gusts and modest rainfall stretched as far east as the  area easterly winds produced  of 5.2ft  1.6m  at  and 10.5ft  3.2m  at  along the atlantic coast of florida by august 31 outer  of the large hurricane produced squally weather over parts of northern florida as early as the morning of august 30 by then the low-lying coastline near apalachicola already began to flood elena would continue to affect the state for several days as it meandered offshore resulting in moderate to heavy rainfall upwards of 10in  250mm  accumulated in many locations peaking at 15.67in  398mm  near  and reaching 11.31in  287mm  at apalachicola farther south in the  area the precipitation was less significant exceeding 5in  130mm  at  parts of the state s northeastern coastfarther away from the hurricane s centeralso saw formidable rainfall with a local maximum of 10.57in  268mm  at jacksonville still those totals represented a relatively dry storm considering its long duration despite initial hopes that the hurricane would help alleviate drought conditions across interior portions of southern florida precipitation there was generally inconsequential storm-heightened tides extended along the florida coast as far south as sarasota and generally ran a modest 3 to 6ft  0.91 to 1.83m  above normal though their duration and extent proved noteworthy the highest recorded  associated with the hurricane was 10ft  3.0m  at apalachicola the combination of raised water levels and strong waves resulted in severe  along many beaches many homes near the water were destroyed by the surge and shoreline structures such as docks causeways bridges low-lying roads and seawalls sustained substantial damage several large fishing piers were either partially or totally destroyed  notably the city pier at  and the popular 1,500ft  460m   fishing pier were both demolished by the hurricane debris from the big indian rocks fishing pier drifted northward toward  and accumulated along private beaches at  the storm s strongest winds remained largely over open waters although severe gusts still brushed coastal cities and barrier islands the strongest winds were observed in two areas of the coast  from cedar key to clearwater and from apalachicola to pensacola official gust reports included 75mph  121km h  at cedar key and nearly 70mph  110km h  at clearwater  later on september 2 a gust of 90mph  140km h  was observed at pensacola along the florida panhandle with sustained winds exceeding 50mph  80km h  winds in franklin county approached 125mph  201km h  by unofficial estimates the storm s effects were not limited to the shore however as fallen trees in the inland tallahassee area damaged around 50 vehicles

though hurricane elena never crossed florida s coast its drawn-out interaction with land agitated large swaths of the state s western shore winds along and around the pinellas county coast generally blew from the south or southwest for several days creating persistent onshore flow that built up heavy seas near clearwater waves reached 8.2ft  2.5m  in height marked by a  of 13 seconds on august 31 one study determined that the storm removed an average of 10 cubic yards of  per linear foot of shoreline in    and pinellas counties with values peaking at 15.6 cubic yards per foot along the predominantly  coasts of   and  counties erosion and structural damage were much more limited partly due to the local southerly or southeasterly wind direction in some cases the hurricane left quasi-permanent alterations on beaches and small islands for example north bunces keyan island of southern pinellas countylost most of its vegetation to the storm and overwashing shifted the southern part of the island up to 330ft  100 m  from its original settlement more extensive changes were seen on and near  which formed in 1921 after a  split a larger barrier island into two by a new channel the inlet became dominant over dunedin pass to the south which grew narrower very gradually until elena rearranged the dynamics of the beach allowing dunedin pass to fill completely with sand within a couple years of the hurricane s passage as a result  became connected to caladesi island elena also created a new inlet known as willy s cut which existed until 1991 interest in artificially reopening dunedin pass prompted an official study in 1994 on the engineering and financial merits of such a project due to the high cost of dredging and the likelihood of nearly continuous maintenance no action was taken

the hurricane tore two barges from their moorings in  and blew them into  leaving the bridge with unspecified damage throughout the area rising waters inundated streets washed boats ashore and destroyed numerous homes along the coast at low-lying cedar key to the north storm surge exceeded 9ft  2.7m  there and at  to the northwest the surge values represented  of 25 to 30 years  elsewhere they were equivalent to about 10-year events floodwaters in cedar key rose to 8ft  2.4m  in depth with 2ft  0.61m  waves atop the standing water the extent of structural damage was largely dependent on construction type as newer elevated buildings fared much better than older structures nearer sea level waterfront restaurants were especially susceptible  winds blew out several large sliding-glass doors at one establishment allowing both the winds and the tide to enter its interior elena severed the sole bridge to cedar key temporarily isolating the city and stranding several residents the  hurriedly worked to make the bridge passable long enough to rescue the stranded individuals the hurricane compromised several other roads destroying a 75ft  23m  section of  monetary losses in cedar key alone were estimated at  2 million and all major aspects of local infrastructure were severely affected initially preventing residents from returning home to the island at least 34 homes and businesses on the island were damaged or destroyed pinellas county suffered some of the worst damage from hurricane elena in florida at the height of the storm over 500,000 of its residents were without electricity forty-four single-family homes were destroyed 31 more were damaged and several condominiums townhouses and commercial buildings were damaged or destroyed the hurricane also wrecked or irreparably compromised nearly 2.7mi  4.3km  of coastal bulkheads and inflicted minor damage on 2.15mi  3.46km  more most of the affected seawalls were degrading or poorly reinforced seawalls with higher standards of construction generally remained intact though even in those cases overwash from the gulf of mexico topped the barriers and deposited large volumes of sand the hurricane cost roughly  100 million in pinellas county

elena s track parallel to the florida panhandle subjected the coastline between apalachicola and pensacola beach to particularly severe conditions that resulted in  significant  property damage there in apalachicola proper winds tore large roofs off buildings and data from florida s department of natural resources indicate that 20 residences and one community building in franklin county were damaged or destroyed structural failure was prevalent along the county s waterfront and on islands such as   however it was mainly limited to poorly constructed buildings several miles of roadways in the county sustained significant damage and about 12 mile  800m  of  was destroyed low seawalls allowed crucial points of the causeway to  to erode causing it to fail in escambia county the hurricane left  2 million in damages throughout much of the remainder of the florida panhandle structural damage was limited though 100,000 people in the pensacola area lost power the configuration of the southern tip of  in gulf county was changed by the storm the hurricane wiped out eagle nests generated freshwater fish kills and affected other species of wildlife at the  and  national wildlife refuges  and  state parks were heavily affected with appreciable but lesser damage in numerous other protected areas  which closely follows the coast in this region required extensive repairs after being undermined in nearly two dozen locations when tropical cyclones move over land they often produce the wind shear and  required for the development of weak embedded supercell thunderstorms which can produce tornadoes these tornadoes are usually weak and short-lived but still capable of producing significant damage while centered over the gulf of mexico the eastern side of hurricane elena s circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central florida a tornado struck just east of  on september 1 destroying 64 single-family houses and mobile homes and damaging another 118  seven people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries later that same day another tornado touched down over downtown leesburg with much less damage in nearby  tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes compromised another 50 residences and inflicted as much as  500,000 in total losses though only minor injuries were reported at  in  a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where  was being prepared for its first flight a tornado in  tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees and tornadic activity was also identified in  the hurricane took one life in the state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths in  a tree struck a parked vehicle killing a person inside the exact cause of the tree s uprooting was unknown although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado elsewhere two individuals died of heart attacks  one while installing storm shutters on his home and another at a designated shelter alabama

the center of elena passed 30mi  50km  south of mainland alabama as it accelerated toward the gulf coast affecting the state s two-county coast and offshore islands wind gusts at  situated much closer to the hurricane s eye were estimated to have reached 130mph  210km h  these velocities represented some of the highest experienced on land from the storm and were strong enough to snap hundreds of large pine trees dauphin island received an 8.4ft  2.6m  storm surge that resulted in substantial flooding and areas of total overwash rainfall amounted to just 3in  76mm  on the island with its location close to the storm s center dauphin island saw the greatest damage in alabama access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane slowing the progression of damage assessments additionally the storm cut power and phone services post-storm surveys revealed discernible patterns in structural damage on the island  these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds first-hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases entire elevated homes were torn from their  and swept into the gulf of mexico the number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 50 though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings in total the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on dauphin island accounting for nearly 25 of all homes and a further 235 sustained substantial damage an unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was  30 million windspeeds were markedly lower over mainland alabama   recorded winds of over 50mph  80km h  with gusts as high as 84mph  135km h  the storm s angle of approach created strong offshore winds along the mainland which depressed water levels and limited the extent of positive surge once winds shifted to onshore winds from the hurricane took a toll on crops ruining 8,000,000lb  3,600,000kg  of pecans and reducing soybean production by 10 farms were still in the process of recovering from  in 1979 when elena struck wave action took a toll on the foundations of waterfront structures along the coasts of  and  counties where elena inflicted about  715,000 worth of damage to roadways most damage was concentrated near the shore where extensive erosion took place and on islands and minor peninsulas farther inland elena s impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines the storm destroyed the city boardwalk at  with the cost of rebuilding expected to approach  300,000  reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100,000 customers according to the  storm-related damages in alabama totaled about  100 million an estimated 300 homes in the state were destroyed by hurricane elena and another 1,345 sustained lighter damage mississippi 
along the coast of mississippi where elena made landfall the most significant effects of the storm stemmed from its strong winds gusting to over 120mph  190km h  recorded gusts included 121mph  195km h  at  115mph  185km h  at pascagoula and 90mph  140km h  at biloxi several other weather stations clocked sustained winds at over 90mph  140km h  consistent with the storm s dry nature rainfall in the state was mainly light and confined to southern and western areas gulfport picked up more than 4.5in  110mm  while just over 3 in  75mm  of rain fell at  some streets in gulfport and biloxi flooded at the height of the storm the highest tides ran 6 to 8ft  1.8 to 2.4m  above normal along the coast reaching 7.9ft  2.4m  above average at pascagoula and  as in alabama negative surge values were recorded at the storm s onset the tide gauge at gulfport recorded a water level of 5.6ft  1.7m  below average early on september 2 before quickly swelling to 5.43ft  1.66m  above normal air pressure reportedly fell so rapidly at pascagoula that car windows began to shatter the barometer there bottomed out at 953 mb the lowest pressure recorded on land in association with the cyclone

the worst of the damage occurred along a 40mi  64km  stretch of coastline centered on the pascagoula area elena s winds damaged most of the schools in  and more specifically every school in pascagoula was structurally compromised to some degree damages to schools in ocean springs totaled  3 million in the same city the overall conditions following the hurricane were described as worse than those in the prior hurricanes frederic or  elena destroyed 20 houses and two supermarkets in ocean springs and several buildings on every city block sustained severe roof damage due to fallen trees two shopping centers were destroyed in nearby  possibly by short-lived tornadoes a  in gautier remarked immediately after the storm that he had not yet seen an unharmed building in the city the community became essentially isolated from the outside world and quickly began to run short of food clean water and gasoline supplies initial reports from pascagoula also indicated that most or all of that city s buildings were damaged nearly every business in the city was damaged to the extent that none were able to open when the storm cleared a post-storm assessment by the mississippi emergency management agency revealed over 900 businesses in jackson county sustained damage contributing to a total of nearly 1,500 in the state s three coastal counties  and  counties were generally not affected quite as severely as communities closer to the alabama border but the entire area still suffered extensively in sections of gulfport large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires allowing them to spread similar destruction was seen to the east at biloxi where the hurricane s winds tore the roofs off many buildings beachfront communities were in a state of disarray with large trees uprooted debris littering the ground and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like u.s 90 damage to schools in harrison countyparticularly in gulfport and biloxiwas extensive most homes in the area survived the storm which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event with relatively little damage several buildings along the coast in the biloxi area sustained severe damage but many of the older houses near the gulf of mexico there fared remarkably well winds brought down large highway signs in some cases striking nearby buildings along the coast elena caused beach erosion damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports several of which were closed pending coast guard inspection winds over inland  damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes and as in alabama the hurricane took a large toll on pecan and soybean crops and farms there were numerous reports in southern mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane s effects reports in gulfport indicated that three schools actively being used as hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes at one location almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens  center endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows doors and part of its roof  about 20 people required rescue by paramedics only minor injuries occurred in association with the possible tornadoes teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that a significant portion of the damage in southern mississippi had been done by tornadoes as a result few tornadoes were confirmed and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane s nature or potentially localized  any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricane s  winds
