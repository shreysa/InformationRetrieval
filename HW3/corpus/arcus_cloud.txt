an arcus cloud is a low horizontal  formation usually appearing as an accessory cloud to a  roll clouds and shelf clouds are the two main types of arcus arcus clouds most frequently form along the leading edge or  gust fronts  of    some of the most dramatic arcus formations mark the gust fronts ofproducing convective systems roll clouds also may arise in the absence of thunderstorms forming along the shallow cold air currents of some  boundaries and

a shelf cloud is a low horizontal wedge-shaped arcus cloud a shelf cloud is attached to the base of the parent  which is usually a thunderstorm but could form on any type of convective clouds rising cloud motion often can be seen in the leading  outer  part of the shelf cloud while the underside often appears  and wind-torn cool sinking air from a  s  spreads out across the land surface with the leading edge called a  this outflow cuts under warm air being drawn into the storm s  as the lower cooler air lifts the warm moist air its water condenses creating a cloud which often rolls with the different winds above and below   people seeing a shelf cloud may believe they have seen a  this is likely a mistake since an approaching shelf cloud appears to form a wall made of cloud a shelf cloud usually appears on the leading edge of a storm and a wall cloud will usually be at the rear of the storm a sharp strong gust front will cause the lowest part of the leading edge of a shelf cloud to be ragged and lined with rising  in a severe case there will be  along the edge with twisting masses of  that may reach to the ground or be accompanied by rising dust a very low shelf cloud accompanied by these signs is the best indicator that a potentially violent wind  is approaching an extreme example of this phenomenon looks almost like a tornado and is known as a  roll cloud 
a roll cloud  cloud atlas name volutus  is a low horizontal tube-shaped and relatively rare type of arcus cloud they differ from shelf clouds by being completely detached from other cloud features roll clouds usually appear to be  rolling  about a horizontal axis they are a solitary wave called a  which is a wave that has a single crest and moves without changing speed or shape one of the most famous frequent occurrences is the  in   which can occur up to four out of ten days in october one of the main causes of the morning glory cloud is the  circulation associated with sea breezes that develop over the  and the  however similar features can be created by  from thunderstorms and are not exclusively associated with coastal regions coastal roll clouds have been seen in many places including  the   the north sea coast coastal regions of australia and nome alaska
