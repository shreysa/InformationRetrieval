severe tropical cyclone olivia was a powerful cyclone that produced the highest non winds on record on  408 kilometres per hour  254mph  breaking the record of 372km h  231mph  on  in the  in april 1934 the 13th  of the  olivia formed on 3 april 1996 to the north of  s  the storm moved generally to the southwest gradually intensifying off  on 8april olivia intensified into a  and subsequently turned more to the south steered by a passing  on 10april olivia produced the worldwide record strongest gust on barrow island and on the same day the cyclone made  near  the storm quickly weakened over land dissipating over the  on 12april while in its formative stages olivia produced light rainfall in the northern territory while offshore western australia the cyclone forced oil platforms to shut down and the combination of high winds and waves caused heavy damage to oil facilities onshore olivia s high winds damaged several small mining towns halting operations every house in  sustained some damage one person in the town was injured by flying glass and had to be flown to receive treatment and nine others were lightly injured the cyclone also produced heavy rainfall and a localized  damage was estimated  in the millions  while the storm was dissipating rough seas in  killed 60million  us 47.5million  worth of farm-raised tuna at  the name olivia was  after the season

in early april 1996 a surge in the  interacted with the  to produce an area of  on 2april the   bom  first identified the system as a low to mid-level  over  north of  despite strong  the system slowly became better organized as it moved southward aided by improving upper-level  early on 5april the   jtwc  classified the system as tropical cyclone 25s as the system began a westward track steered by a building mid-level  to the south shortly thereafter the bom upgraded the system to a  designating the storm as tropical cyclone olivia in the days following olivia s development persistent wind shear prevented convection from developing around the center of circulation by 8april an upper-level  passed to the south of the nascent cyclone leading to lower shear following this the system had developed sufficiently for the jtwc to upgrade it to a category1 equivalent on the   sshs  estimating  of 120km h  75mph  around the same time the bom upgraded olivia to a severe tropical cyclone assessing similar wind speeds but sustained over 10minutes after the storm reached this intensity the mid-level ridge south of the cyclone began to weaken turning olivia toward the southwest by 9april the system attained category4 intensity according to the bom as it continued to strengthen during the afternoon of 9april the bom estimated that olivia attained its lowest  of 925   along with 10minute sustained winds of 195km h  120mph  around 00 00 on 10april the jtwc assessed the cyclone to have attained 1minute winds of 230km h  145mph  equivalent to a category4 on the sshs by this time another trough bypassed the cyclone causing olivia to turn to the south and accelerate to the southeast early on 10april data from a nearby  at the  near  showed that the storm had developed a 65km  40mi  wide  late on 10april the center of olivia passed near  at peak intensity shortly thereafter the storm passed near  as a high-end category4 or low-end category5 cyclone within several hours of passing by varanus island olivia made  near  at peak intensity shortly thereafter the storm began to weaken overland accelerating to the southeast the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below hurricane-force during the afternoon of 11april olivia weakened to a tropical low over southern australia it moved over the  and lost its identity as a gale-force low on 12april after it was absorbed by a trough impact and aftermath 
as a minimal cyclone in the  olivia brought minor rainfall and gusty winds to parts of the  on 9april the fringes of the storm dropped 84mm  3.3in  in the  region of western australia an oil rig in the timor sea recorded a wind gust of 127km h  79mph  during the storm s passage offshore olivia affected the southern portion of australia s northwest shelf which had 24oil and gas facilities the storm produced large  up to 21m  69ft  in conjunction with extreme wind gusts 265km h  165mph  waves toppled an oil drilling structure about 40km  25mi  northeast of barrow island the first of its kind to fail since the 1980s the waves also wrecked several anchors for underwater pipelines although no lines were ruptured on barrow island the winds knocked over 30 and several buildings and instruments were damaged while high waves incurred beach erosion damage to offshore platforms was estimated in the millions of dollars a group of 17people initially considered missing rode out the storm on the offshore mackerel island onshore officials closed a portion of  as well as other roads in the area ahead of the storm hundreds of residents in older structures and mobile homes as well as an  village near  were ordered to evacuate to safer locations five iron mines were closed during the storm s passage forcing the 1,500workers to return home the disruptions from the cyclone affected about 340,000tonnes of lost production about 800,000 of lost oil production resulted from closed offshore platforms oil fields reopened by 14april moving ashore western australia olivia produced peak gusts of 257km h  160mph  in  the station s second-highest wind gust from a tropical cyclone olivia also produced gusts of 267km h  166mph  at varanus island which was the highest wind gust on record in australia until the higher reading on barrow island during the storm was confirmed it broke the previous peak of 259km h  161mph  set by  in 1975 and was later matched by  in 1999 the high winds at mardie station damaged the local airport hangar and several windmills farther inland olivia still produced wind gusts of 158km h  98mph  in  which damaged many roofs trees and power lines the town s police station and medical center lost their roofs during the storm and every house sustained some damage of the 82houses in the small town 55 lost their roof it was estimated that pannawonica would remain without power for three weeks one person in town was injured by flying broken glass who had to be airlifted to  for medical attention in nearby  nearly every building was damaged and the roofs of several farm buildings were ripped off several other small towns in the region sustained damage to roofs power lines and trees and a 24year old  was destroyed along the fortescue river olivia also dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 167mm  6.6in  in red hill although flooding was not significant the storm also produced a 2m  6.6ft   in localized areas at the port of  the storm sank three boats although no one was aboard damage was estimated in the  millions of dollars  according to a local newspaper and overall 10people were injured as the remnants of olivia moved through australia they dropped heavy rainfall and brought gusty winds to   recorded gusts of 106km h  66mph  on 12april strong enough to knock down tree branches on nearby  at  sediment stirred up by olivia s remnants killed 60,000farmed tuna worth about a 60million  us 47.5million  the fish were in cages and died due to abnormally high oxygen levels in the water caused by olivia s high winds and rough waves the remnants of olivia later brought rainfall to the states of  and  the name  olivia  was later  from the  for the australian region after the storm s passage the  flew six generators to pannawonica after the town was out of power for two nights and the western australian government sent another 13generators residents in the town received counseling to cope with the stress of the storm s aftermath records 
at 10 55utc on 10april 1996 along the offshore barrow island an automatic privately operated  recorded a three-second wind gust of 408km h  253mph  at a position 10m  33ft  above sea level the bom was initially unsure of the veracity of the reading although a team at the 1999  presented the reading as the highest wind gust on earth in 2009 the  commission for climatology researched whether  in 2008 produced a record 340km h  211mph  gust on  cuba  one committee member recalled the gust set during olivia which spurred the investigation the reading occurred along the western edge of the eyewall possibly related to  based on other similarly high wind gusts during olivia  369km h  229mph  and 374km h  232mph  observed within five minutes of the record gust  the team confirmed that the instrument was observing properly during the storm the same anemometer also recorded five-minute sustained winds of 178km h  111mph  causing a much greater than normal ratio of gusts to sustained winds the team confirmed that the instrument was regularly inspected and calibrated and that the reading was during the passage of the eyewall on 26january 2010 nearly 14years later the world meteorological organization announced that the wind gust was the highest recorded worldwide this gust surpassed the previous non-tornadic wind speed of 372km h  231mph  on  in the  in april 1934 the long delay was partly due to the anemometer not being owned by the bom and as a result the agency did not enact a follow-up investigation despite the high winds the anemometer and a nearby building were not damaged due to the winds occurring over a very short time see also
