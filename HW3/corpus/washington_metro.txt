history 




metro under construction at the navy yard in 1989


during the 1960s plans were laid for a massive freeway system in washington  who chaired the  thought that a rail transit system would never be self-sufficient because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline but the plan met  and was altered to include a  system plus rail line radials the beltway received full funding  funding for the ambitious inner loop freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the metro system in 1960 the federal government created the national capital transportation agency to develop a rapid rail system in 1966 a bill creating wmata was passed by the federal government the district of columbia virginia and maryland with planning power for the system being transferred to it from the ncta

wmata approved plans for a 98-mile  158km  regional system in 1968 construction began after a groundbreaking ceremony on december 9 1969 when secretary of transportation  district mayor  and maryland governor  tossed the first spade of dirt at judiciary square the first portion of the system opened march 27 1976 with 4.6 miles  7.4km  available on the red line with five stations from rhode island avenue to farragut north all in the district of columbia arlington county virginia was linked to the system on july 1 1977  montgomery county maryland on february 6 1978  prince george s county maryland on november 20 1978  and fairfax county virginia and alexandria virginia on december 17 1983 underground stations were built with cathedral-like arches of concrete highlighted by soft indirect lighting the name metro was suggested by  who designed the subway maps for the  the 103-mile  166km  83-station system was completed with the opening of the green line segment to branch avenue on january 13 2001 this did not mean the end of the growth of the system  a 3.22-mile  5.18km  extension of the blue line to  and  opened on december 18 2004 the first    at the time called the new york aveflorida avegallaudet university station  on the red line between  and  opened november 20 2004 construction began in march 2009 for an extension to  to be built in two phases the first phase five stations connecting east falls church to tysons corner and wiehle avenue in reston opened on july 26 2014 metro construction required billions of federal dollars originally provided by congress under the authority of the national capital transportation act of 1969  public law 91-143  the cost was paid with 67 federal money and 33 local money this act was amended on january 3 1980 by public law 96-184  the national capital transportation amendment of 1979   also known as the stark-harris act  which authorized additional funding of  1.7 billion to permit the completion of 89.5 miles  144.0km  of the system as provided under the terms of a full funding grant agreement executed with wmata in july 1986 which required 20 to be paid from local funds on november 15 1990   the national capital transportation amendments of 1990  authorized an additional  1.3 billion in federal funds for construction of the remaining 13.5 miles  21.7km  of the 103-mile  166km  system completed via the execution of full funding grant agreements with a 63 federal 37 local matching the highest ridership for a single day was on the day of the  january 20 2009 with 1,120,000 riders it broke the previous record set the day before of 866,681 riders june 2008 set several ridership records  the single-month ridership record of 19,729,641 total riders the record for highest average weekday ridership with 1,044,400 weekday trips had five of the ten highest ridership days and had 12 weekdays in which ridership exceed 800,000 trips in february 2006 metro officials chose randi miller a car dealership employee from  to record new  doors opening   doors closing  and  please stand clear of the doors thank you  announcements after winning an open contest to replace the messages recorded by sandy carroll in 1996 the  doors closing  contest attracted 1,259 contestants from across the country on october 30 2010 the crowd at the  broke a 19-year record in saturday ridership with 825,437 trips the previous record had been set on june 8 1991 at 786,358 trips during the desert storm rally opening dates
many metro stations were designed by chicago architect  and are examples of late-20th century  with their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs metro stations display aspects of  design the stations also reflect the influence of washington s  in their overarching  ceiling  weese worked withbased lighting designer bill lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system all of metro s original brutalist stations are found in  and neighboring urban corridors of  while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs in 2007 the design of the metro s vaulted-ceiling stations was voted number 106 on the   list compiled by the   aia  and was the only brutalist design to win a place among the 150 selected by this public survey in january 2014 the aia announced that it would present its  to the washington metro system for  an architectural design of enduring significance  that  has stood the test of time by embodying architectural excellence for 25 to 35 years  the announcement cited the key role of weese who conceived and implemented a  common design kit-of-parts  which continues to guide the construction of new metro stations over a quarter-century later albeit with designs modified slightly for cost reasons

in an effort to gain revenues wmata has started to allow retail ventures in metro stations wmata has authorized dvd-rental vending machines and ticket booths for the old town trolley tours and is seeking additional retail tenants 
financing 
metro relies extensively on passenger fares and appropriated financing from the maryland virginia and washington d.c governments which are represented on metro s board of directors the system does not have a dedicated revenue stream as other cities  mass transit systems do critics allege that this has contributed to metro s recent history of maintenance and safety problems for fiscal year 2015 the estimated   fare revenue divided by operating expenses  was 66 percent based on the wmata approved budget infrastructure

during normal passenger operation on revenue tracks trains are designed to be controlled by an integrated   ato  and   atc  system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention all trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors make station announcements and supervise their trains the system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary since june 2009 when  and killed nine people due in part to malfunctions in the atc system all metro trains have been manually operated the current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks speed restrictions and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains increased dwell time and worse on-time performance metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 2017 but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues the train doors were originally designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them much as elevator doors do almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled at present the doors may be opened automatically or manually if a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction the operator must re-open the door hours and headways

the most prominent expansion is the dulles corridor metrorail project dubbed the silver line a 23-mile  37km  extension from the orange line into  by way of  and  rail to dulles has been discussed since the system opened in 1976 the current silver line project was formally proposed in 2002 and initially approved by the  in 2004 after several delays federal funding for phase 1 was secured in december 2008 and construction began in march 2009 the line is being constructed in two phases  the first phase to  in  opened july 26 2014 and the second phase to  beyond dulles airport is projected for completion in 2019 or 2020 blue line realignment 
blue line trains share a single tunnel with orange line and silver line trains to cross the potomac river the current tunnel limits service in each direction creating a choke point a 2001 proposal would have rerouted the blue line between the  and  stations by building a bridge or tunnel from virginia to a new station in  the proposal was later rejected due to cost but metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011 orange line extension 
the virginia department of transportation  vdot  announced on january 18 2008 that it and the virginia department of rail and public transportation  drpt  had begun work on a draft environmental impact statement  eis  for the i-66 corridor in fairfax and prince william counties according to vdot the eis officially named the i-66 multimodal transportation and environment study would focus on improving mobility along i-66 from the capital beltway  i-495  interchange in fairfax county to the interchange with u.s route 15 in prince william county the eis also allegedly includes a four-station extension of the orange line past vienna the extension would continue to run in the i-66 median and would have stations at chain bridge road fair oaks stringfellow road and centreville near virginia route 28 and u.s route 29 in its final report published june 8 2012 the study and analysis revealed that an  extension would have a minimal impact on metrorail ridership and volumes on study area roadways inside the beltway and would therefore not relieve congestion in the study corridor 
fort belvoir and fort meade extensions 
in 2005 the  announced that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to  in virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to  in maryland by 2012 as part of that year s  plan in anticipation of such a move local officials and the military proposed extending the blue and green lines to service each base the proposed extension of the green line could cost  100 million per mile  60 million per kilometer  and a  extension to fort belvoir was estimated to cost up to  800 million neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction potomac yard station
