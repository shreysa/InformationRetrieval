china launched its first  known as   lit  the east is red 1  into  on its long march space rocket on april 24 1970 becoming the fifth nation to achieve independent launch capability early launches had an inconsistent record focusing on launching of chinese satellites starting in 1990 the long march rocket entered the international market however several setbacks occurred during the early 1990s on january 26 1995 a long march 2e rocket veered off course two seconds after take-off from xichang space center and exploded killing at least six on the ground  on february 14 1996 a similar failure occurred during the launch of   the rocket veered severely off course immediately after clearing the launch tower and crashed into a village following the disaster foreign media were sequestered in a bunker for five hours while some have alleged the chinese military attempted to  clean up  the damage  officials later blamed the failure on an  unexpected gust of wind   initially reported 6 deaths and 57 injuries in the aftermath of the explosion u.s satellite makers shared information that allowed the chinese to determine that the problem was in the welds this sharing of information was later deemed illegal by the united states and u.s satellite maker  was fined  14 million by the  for thirteen years starting in august 1996 75 consecutive successful launches were conducted including multiple milestones 

on october 15 2003 the long march 2f rocket successfully launched the  spacecraft orbiter carrying china s first astronaut into space  china thus became the third nation to send a person in space independently after the  russia and the united states on october 12 2005 long march 2f launched the  with two astronauts on june 1 2007 long march rockets completed their 100th launch overall on october 24 2007 the long march 3a successfully launched  18 05 gmt 8  the    orbiting  from the  on september 25 2008 a long march 2f launched  china s first three-man mission and first  mission 
the string of successful launches ended on august 31 2009 when the launch of  partially failed due to a third stage malfunction on the june 11 2013 a  launched from the  putting three astronauts into orbit for the  mission as of march 2016 there have been 225 long march missions payloads 
the long march is china s primary expendable launch system family the  spacecraft and  lunar orbiters are also launched on the long march rocket the maximum payload for  is 12,000 kilograms  cz-3b  the maximum payload for  is 5,500kg  cz-3b e  the next generation rocket  variants will offer more payload in the future propellants 
 s 1st and 2nd stage uses  and  propellants and its upper stage uses a spin-stabilized solid rocket engine    the main stages and associated  use  as the  and  as the fuel the upper stages  third stage  of long march 3 rockets use  and  engines using   lh2  as the fuel and   lox  as the oxidizer the new generation of long march rocket family  and its derivations   will use  and  as core stage and liquid booster propellant with  and lh2 in upper stages variants 




timeline of long march rocket families


the long march rockets are organized into several series 









note there is no long march 10 

long march 8 
a new series of launch vehicles in study which is geared towards  launches long march 9 
the long march 9  lm-9 cz-9 or changzheng 9 chinese    is a chinese super-heavy carrier rocket that is currently in study it is planned for a maximum payload capacity of at least 140,000kg to  or at least 50,000kg to  its first flight is expected in 2025 in preparation for a lunar landing sometime in the 2030s it has been stated that around 70 of the hardware and components needed for a test flight are currently undergoing testing with the first engine test to occur by the end of 2018 the proposed design would be a three-staged rocket with the initial core having a diameter of 10 meters and use a cluster of four engines multiple variants on the rocket have been proposed cz-9 being the largest with four liquid-fuel boosters with the aforementioned leo payload capacity of 140,000kg cz-9a having just two boosters and a leo payload capacity of 100,000kg and finally cz-9b having just the core stage and a leo payload capacity of 50,000kg if produced it would be classified as a  along with the american  and unsuccessful soviet   and the  and  currently under development in the united states long march 11 
the long march 11 is a  that applies china s largest solid-fuel rocket engine and was designed to meet the need to rapidly launch satellites in case of emergencies or disasters its first launch on 25 september 2015 was reported to be successful and launched 4 micro satellites into  origins 
the  rocket is derived from earlier chinese 2-stage   or dong feng 4 missile and    rocket families are derivatives of the chinese 2-stage   or dong feng 5 missile however like its counterparts in both the united states and in russia the differing needs of space rockets and strategic missiles have caused the development of space rockets and missiles to diverge the main goal of a space rocket is to maximize payload while for strategic missiles increased throw weight is much less important than the ability to launch quickly and to survive a  this divergence has become clear in the next generation of long march rockets which use  in sharp contrast to the next generation of strategic missiles which are mobile and  the next generation of long march rocket  rocket family will be a brand new design while  and  can be seen as derivations because they use the  design of  to build small-to-mid capacity launch vehicles launch sites 
there are four launch centers in china they are 






most of the commercial satellite launches of long march vehicles have been from  located in   province  in  province is under expansion and will be the main launch center for future commercial satellite launches long march launches also take place from the more military oriented  in  province from which the manned  also launches  is located in  province and focuses on the launches of  satellites commercial launch services 
china markets launch services under the  its efforts to launch communications satellites were dealt a blow in the mid-1990s after the united states stopped issuing export licenses to companies to allow them to launch on chinese launch vehicles out of fear that this would help  in the face of this  built the  satellite with no components from the united states whatsoever this allowed it to be launched on a chinese launch vehicle without violating u.s  restrictions the launch on a long march 3b rocket was successfully conducted on july 5 2007 a chinese long march 2d launched venezuela s   francisco de miranda  on september 29 2012 see also
