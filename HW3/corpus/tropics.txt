 tropical  is sometimes used in a general sense for a  to mean warm to hot and moist year-round often with the sense of lush vegetation many tropical areas have a dry and wet season the  rainy season or green season is the time of year ranging from one or more months when most of the average annual  in a region falls areas with wet seasons are disseminated across portions of the tropics and  under the  for  a wet-season month is defined as a month where average precipitation is 60 millimetres  2.4in  or more  technically do not have dry or wet seasons since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year some areas with pronounced rainy seasons see a break in rainfall during mid-season when the  or  moves poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season  typical vegetation in these areas ranges from moist  to  when the wet season occurs during the warm season or   falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours the wet season is a time when  improves freshwater quality improves and vegetation grows significantly leading to crop yields late in the season floods cause rivers to overflow their banks and some animals to retreat to higher ground  nutrients diminish and erosion increases the incidence of  increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime unfortunately the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season as the crops have yet to mature however regions within the tropics may well not have a tropical climate under the  much of the area within the geographical tropics is classed not as  tropical  but as  dry    or   including the  the  and  also there are  and snow-capped peaks including   and the  as far south as the northernmost parts of  and  ecosystems

 tropicality  refers to the geographic imagery that many people outside the tropics have of that region the idea of tropicality gained renewed interest in modern geographical discourse when french geographer  published les pays tropicaux  the tropical world in english  in the late 1940s tropicality encompasses at least two contradictory imageries one is that the tropics represent a garden of eden a heaven on earth  the alternative is that the tropics are primitive and essentially lawless the latter view was often discussed in western literaturemore so than the first western scholars also theorized about the reasons that tropical areas were deemed  inferior  to regions in the northern hemisphere a popular explanation focused on the differences in climatetropical regions typically have much warmer weather than northern regions this theme led some scholars including gourou to argue that warmer climates correlate to primitive indigenous populations lacking control over nature compared to northern populations having  mastered nature  see also
