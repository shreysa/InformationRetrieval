nws hq in silver spring maryland


in 1870 the weather bureau of the united states was established through a  of  signed by president  with a mission to  provide for taking meteorological observations at the military stations in the interior of the continent and at other points in the states and territories...and for giving notice on the northern  and on the seacoast by magnetic  and marine signals of the approach and force of storms  the agency was placed under the  as congress felt  military discipline would probably secure the greatest promptness regularity and accuracy in the required observations  within the department of war it was assigned to the  under brigadier general  general myer gave the national weather service its first name  the division of telegrams and reports for the benefit of commerce   who began developing probabilistic forecasts using daily weather data sent by the  chamber of commerce and  which he convinced to back the collection of such information in 1869  was appointed as the bureau s first chief meteorologist in his earlier role as the civilian assistant to the chief of the signal service abbe urged the department of war to research weather conditions to provide a scientific basis behind the forecasts  he would continue to urge the study of meteorology as a science after becoming weather bureau chief while a debate went on between the signal service and congress over whether the forecasting of weather conditions should be handled by civilian agencies or the signal service s existing forecast office a congressional committee was formed to oversee the matter recommending that the office s operations be transferred to the department of war following a two-year investigation the agency first became a civilian enterprise in 1890 when it became part of the  under the oversight of that branch the bureau began issuing flood warnings and fire weather forecasts and output the first daily national surface weather maps  it also established a network to distribute warnings for  as well as a data exchange service that relayed european weather analysis to the bureau and vice versa the first weather bureau  was launched in  in 1937 which prompted a switch from routine aircraft observation to radiosondes within two years the bureau prohibited the word   from being used in any of its weather products out of concern for inciting panic  a move contradicted in its intentions by the high death tolls in past tornado outbreaks due to the lack of advanced warning  until 1938 when it began disseminating tornado warnings exclusively to  personnel the bureau would later be moved to the  in 1940 on july 12 1950 bureau chief francis w reichelderfer officially lifted the agency s ban on public tornado alerts in a circular letter noting to all first order stations that  weather bureau employees should avoid statements that can be interpreted as a negation of the bureau s willingness or ability to make tornado forecasts  and that a  good probability of verification  exist when issuing such forecasts due to the difficulty in accurately predicting tornadic activity however it would not be until it faced criticism for continuing to refuse to provide public tornado warnings and preventing the release of the usaf severe weather warning center s tornado forecasts  pioneered in 1948 by air force capt  and major ernest fawbush  beyond military personnel that the bureau issued its first experimental public tornado forecasts in march 1952 in 1957 the bureau began using  for short-term forecasting of local storms and hydrological events using modified versions of those used by  aircraft to create the   weather surveillance radar 1957  with a network of wsr systems being deployed nationwide through the early 1960s  some of the radars were upgraded to  models beginning in 1974 the weather bureau became part of the  when that agency was formed in august 1966 the environmental science services administration was renamed the   noaa  on october 1 1970 with the enactment of the  at this time the weather bureau became the national weather service   next generation radar  a system of  deployed to improve the detection and warning time of severe local storms replaced the wsr-57 and wsr-74 systems between 1988 and 1997 bob glahn has written a comprehensive history of the first hundred years of the national weather service forecast sub-organizations

a cooperative observer program weather station 

getting more information on the atmosphere more frequently and from more locations is the key to improving forecasts and warnings due to the large installation and operating costs associated with asos the stations are widely spaced therefore the cooperative observer program  coop  a network of approximately 11,000 mostly volunteer weather observers provides much of the meteorological and climatological data to the country the program which was established in 1890 under the organic act currently has a twofold mission 

provide observational meteorological data usually consisting of daily maximum and minimum temperatures snowfall and 24-hour precipitation totals required to define the climate of the united states and to help measure long-term climate changes provide observational meteorological data in near real-time to support forecast warning and other public service programs of the nws 
the national weather service also maintains connections with privately operated  such as the  for data collection in part through the   madis  funding is also provided to the  volunteer weather observer network through parent agency noaa marine observations

the national weather service has developed a multi-tier concept for forecasting or alerting the public to all types of hazardous weather 

outlook  hazardous weather outlooks are issued daily by individual weather forecast offices to address potentially hazardous weather or hydrologic events that may occur over the next seven days the outlook will include information about the potential of convective thunderstorm activity  including the potential for severe thunderstorms  heavy rain or  winter weather and extremes of heat or cold it is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event including notification to storm spotter groups and local  agencies on the recommendation of activation during severe weather situations in areas prone to such events other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis such as the flood potential outlook and severe weather outlook advisory  an advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring imminent or likely advisories are for less serious conditions than warnings that cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised could lead to situations that may threaten life or property watch  a watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly but its occurrence location or timing is still uncertain it is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their safety plans in motion can do so in advance if a forecasted event should occur a watch means that hazardous weather is possible but not imminent people should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and monitor various avenues that provide noaa-disseminated data to listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities warning  a warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring imminent or likely a warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property people in the path of the storm need to take protective action special weather statement  or significant weather advisory   a special weather statement is issued when something rare or unusual is occurring these are usually triggered by sudden changes in meteorological conditions the statements are to be taken as warnings for residents of a specific area significant weather advisories are often issued for storms not severe enough for severe thunderstorm warnings but for strong winds and small hail the warning generally states that an area might be at risk for a slight weather danger though not all weather statements are warnings other times statements describe informative facts about a weather system  such as local snowfall  
weather warnings and advisories 
main article  
short-fused  and advisories issued by local nws forecast offices are generally less than 5005,000 square miles  1,30012,900km2  in area warnings for severe local storms are intended to be issued preceding the arrival of severe weather at a particular locale by one hour or less  the nws also issues warnings and advisories for various hydrological and non-hydrological events including  non-thunderstorm high winds  intense heat or cold fire weather and marine hazards which vary in timepsan depending on the weather situation   are issued by the   nhc  a guidance center of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  the nws defines a warning as a  hazardous weather or hydrologic event  is occurring is imminent or has a very high probability of occurring  and an advisory as   special weather conditions that are less serious than a warning    for events that may cause significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised    could lead to situations that may threaten life and or property  in earnest they indicate that hazardous weather conditions are occurring that may pose a risk to life and property and are intended to direct the general public to take immediate action and heed safety precautions  it also has the side purpose of directing emergency management personnel to be on standby in case the weather situation leads to property damage or casualties severe thunderstorm and flood warnings indicate that organized severe thunderstorms or flooding are occurring whereas tornado warnings are issued if a storm is indicated to be producing an observed tornado or exhibits strong low-level rotation the process of issuing a warning or advisory begins with observations of a hydrological or extreme weather event that is either occurring at present  through radar imagery reports from local television and radio stations or ground observations by local law enforcement civil defense officials media outlets or storm spotters  or is forecast to occur within 12 to 24 hours if after collaboration a warning or advisory is deemed necessary the weather forecast office will generate a bulletin product via the advance weather interactive processing system   and then disseminate the alert through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies on the internet to  satellites and on  the product outlines the alert type the issuing wfo the sections of government subdivisions    or   covered by the alert and its time of expiration  based on the local   some products  particularly for severe thunderstorm tornado and flood warnings  include a tag requesting  activation to trigger public alert messages via television radio stations noaa weather radio and smartphone apps and messaging services for local storm events the warning or advisory product also outlines a meteorological summary of the most recent storm location or local storm report issued prior to the product s issuance  including the approximate area in  and estimated speed and direction  associated hazards impacts municipalities and designated land areas  and if applicable highway mile markers  covered by the alert and boilerplate action messages informing the public of safety precautions they need to take or advising them to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local national weather service office a statement may be issued as a follow-up message to a warning watch or emergency which may update extend or cancel the previously issued product or be used as a notification of significant weather for which no type of alert is currently in effect for a given location or is expected to be in effect in situations where a forecaster indicates a significant threat of extremely severe and life-threatening weather with an ongoing local weather event enhanced wording may be used to note the heightened threat by a significant local storm event in april 2012 the nws introduced the impact

region headquarters by the spring of 2015  incorporate message tags within the main body of the product describing the source of the hazard report damage potential and if applicable radar indications or physical observations of tornadoes or the possibility of a tornado  hazards are also summarized at the close of the product text  describing estimated maximum hail size and wind gusts and if applicable if a storm has the potential to produce a tornado or in the event of a tornado warning the basis of the warning or its damage threat  the wording    pds  which originated by the storm prediction center for use in tornado watch products during expected high-end severe weather outbreaks is subjectively issued it is occasionally issued with tornado warnings normally if a large tornado capable of producing ef3 to ef5 damage or staying on the ground for long-duration  sometimes uninterrupted  paths has been reported  although a  may be issued in such cases if the tornado is expected to track into a densely populated area  pds warnings for other alerts occur with even less frequency and their criteria varies depending on the alert type to which the wording is applied until september 30 2007 local offices of the national weather service issued warnings for severe thunderstorms tornadoes flash flooding and marine hazards using geopolitical boundaries the implementation of storm-based warnings on october 1 2007 saw alerts for these meteorological or hydrological threats be delineated by  shapes in map-based weather hazard products which outline the specified sections of government sub-jurisdictions that the warning covers based on the projected path of a storm as determined by doppler radar at the time of the warning s issuance  however entire counties parishes may sometimes be included in the warning polygon especially if they encompass a small geographical area warnings can be expanded contracted  by removing jurisdictions where spc and nws forecasters no longer consider there to be a viable threat of severe weather in which case the storm-based warning may take on a  representation in map-based watch products  or canceled before their set time of expiration by local nws offices the nws also releases experimental severe weather impact products for use on  accounts maintained by local forecast offices as well as the enhanced data display  edd  an experimental pilot project created by the  office s weatherready nation initiative the product provides a graphical depiction of short-fuse warnings and watches  specifically tornado and severe thunderstorm watches and warnings and flash flood warnings  showing a map of the warning area  outlined as a red polygon  and locations  including communities and interstate highways  that will be impacted for severe thunderstorm tornado and flash flood warnings the estimated population count of the warned area and approximate totals of public schools and hospitals within the warning area as

accuracy problems 
critics such as university of washington professor cliff mass have pointed out that nws forecasts are not as accurate as they could be and that this has resulted in inaccurate daily weather forecasts and dangerously bad predictions concerning the location and intensity of extreme weather events like blizzards and hurricanes certain private companies the british  the   ecmwf  and the northwest regional modeling consortium in seattle have been cited as producing more accurate predictions in certain circumstances according to critics causes include 

lack of sufficient computing power to run simulations known to be better  including higher-resolution simulations and  ensemble  forecasts where multiple runs tweak variables slightly to detect low-confidence simulations 
not using techniques shown to improve accuracy by recent academic research
not  from all available sources such as  data from commercial airliners  due to budget cuts this could not be purchased from  weather solutions on an ongoing basis 
lack of updated equipment on weather satellites
lack of focus on a small number of high-quality models compared to the met office and the ecmwf
