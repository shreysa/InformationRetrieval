map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the 


the first indications of conditions favorable to the origin of this disturbance were noted during the last 2 or 3 days of august to the eastward and northward of turks islands  but it was not until august 31 that a definite depression appeared near long island in the southeastern bahamas and deepened rapidly as it moved westward  hurricane intensity was doubtless reached by the developing disturbance near the south end of andros island on september 1 a broad recurve brought it to the florida keys late on september 2 by that time it was of small diameter but of tremendous force  there was a calm of forty minutes on lower matecumbe key and about fifty-five minutes at the long key fishing camp 9 20 to 10 15 p.m the rate of progress of the hurricane was about ten miles an hour and the calm center must have been nine to ten miles in diameter after leaving the keys the storm skirted the florida gulf coast on a broad recurve passed inland at cedar keys and finally left the continent near cape henry heavy rainfall spread in advance and magnified to the left of the track across the mid-atlantic states rainfall totals of 16.7 inches  420mm  in  and 13.4 inches  340mm  at  were the highest seen with the storm the storm continued into the north atlantic ocean where off southern greenland it was lost on september 10 by merging with a cyclone of extratropical origin the first recorded instance of an aircraft flown for the specific purpose of locating a hurricane occurred on the afternoon of september 2 the weather bureaus 1 30 pm advisory placed the center of the hurricane at north latitude 23 20 west longitude 80 15 moving slowly westward this was about 27 miles north of  villa clara cuba and 145 miles east of havana captain leonard povey of the cuban army air corps volunteered to investigate the threat to the capital flying a  captain povey an american expatriate who was the ceac s chief training officer observed the storm north of its reported position but flying an open-cockpit biplane opted not to fly into it he later proposed an aerial hurricane patrol nothing further came of this idea until june 1943 when colonel joe duckworth and lieutenant ralph o hair flew into  near  records 
the labor day hurricane was the most intense storm ever known to have struck the united states  and any land areas in the western hemisphere  having the lowest sea level pressure ever recorded in the united statesa central pressure of 892 mbar  26.35 inhg suggesting an intensity of between 162 kn and 164 kn  186.4mph  188.7mph  the somewhat compensating effects of a slow  7 kn 8.1mph  translational velocity along with an extremely tiny radius of maximum wind  5 nmi 9.3 miles  led to an analyzed intensity at landfall of 160 kt  184.1mph category 5  this is the highest intensity for a u.s landfalling hurricane in  as 1969s  has been recently reanalyzed to have the second highest landfalling intensity with 150 kn  172.6mph  
records of the lowest pressure were secured from three   the values ranging from 26.75 to 26.98 inches however none of these barometers had previously been compared to standard one of the barometers owned by ivar olson was shipped to the weather bureau in washington where it was tested in the instrument division careful laboratory tests showed it to be an exceptionally responsive and reliable instrument and that the correct reading at the position of the needle indicated by mr olson at the center of the storm was 26.35 inches this is the world s lowest record of pressure at a land station 






preparations 
northeast storm warnings were ordered displayed from  to  in the september 1 9 30 am weather bureau advisory upon receipt of this advisory the u.s coast guard station miami fl sent a plane along the coast to advise boaters and campers of the impending danger by dropping message blocks a second flight was made sunday afternoon all planes were placed in the hangar and its door closed at 10 00 am monday morning the 3 30 am advisory september 2   predicted the disturbance  will probably pass through the  monday  and cautioned  against high tides and gales florida keys and ships in path  the 1 30 pm advisory ordered hurricane warnings for the  district which extended north to  at around 2 00 pm fred ghent assistant administrator florida emergency relief administration requested a special train to evacuate the veterans work camps located in the upper keys it departed miami at 4 25 pm  delayed by a draw bridge opening obstructions across the track poor visibility and the necessity to back the locomotive below homestead  so it could head out on the return trip  the train finally arrived at the islamorada station on upper matecumbe key at about 8 20 pm this coincided with an abrupt wind shift from northeast  florida bay  to southeast  atlantic ocean  and the arrival on the coast of the  impact 
three ships ran afoul of the storm  the danish motorship leise maersk was carried over  and grounded nearly 4 miles beyond after being totally disabled by the wind and sea with engine room flooded  this was just offshore of upper matecumbe key no one died and the ship was salvaged on sept 20  the american tanker pueblo drifted helplessly in the storm from 2 to 10 pm of september 2  she went out of control near  and was carried completely around the storm center finding herself in 8 hours about 25 miles northeastward of her original position and just barely able to claw off   however the ship that made the headlines was the american steamship dixie out of new orleans with a crew of 121 and 229 passengers it ran aground on  near key largo without loss of life it was re-floated on september 19 and towed to new york

veterans  work camps 
three veterans work camps existed in the florida keys before the hurricane   1 on   3 and  5 on  the camp payrolls for august 30 listed 695 veterans they were employed in a project to complete the  connecting the mainland with key west the camps including 7 in florida and 4 in south carolina were established by  director of the   fera  in the autumn of 1934 the problem of transient veterans in washington dc threatened  to become acute and did become acute in january facilities in the capital were inadequate to handle the large numbers of veterans seeking jobs president  met with mr hopkins and  director of the   ccc  to discuss solutions he suggested the southern camp plan and approved the program worked out by mr hopkins for their establishment and maintenance the va identified eligible veterans fera offered grants to the states for their construction projects if they would accept the veterans as laborers the state emergency relief administrations were responsible for the daily management of the camps in practice the state eras were very much the creatures of fera to the extent of handpicking the administrators that only two states participated was perhaps attributable to the then popular impression that the transient veterans were diseased bums and hoboes it was a characterization enthusiastically fed by the media in august 1935 both time magazine and the new york times published sensational articles on aug 15 1935 hopkins announced the termination of the veterans work program and closure of all the camps on august 26 and 27 1935 one of the veterans albert c keith wrote letters to both the president and  urging that the camps not be closed keith was editor of the weekly camp paper the key veteran news he was emphatic that the veterans were being defamed and that their work program was actually a success story rehabilitating many veterans for return to civilian life the news published occasional reports from camp  2 mullet key  at the entrance to tampa bay this was the  colored  veterans camp  the keys camps were white only in early august the colored veterans were transferred to the new camp  8 in  rescue 
improved weather conditions on wednesday september 4 permitted the evacuation of survivors to begin participating in the rescue were

    fera    wpa    ccc     dade county undertakers association dade county medical society city and county officials and numerous individuals  including   headquarters of the operation was the near shore of snake creek on plantation key with the bridge over the creek washed out this was the farthest point south on the highway on september 5 at a meeting of all public and private agencies involved governor  placed the sheriffs of monroe and dade counties in overall control 
on the evening of september 4 1935 brigadier general  va administrator received a phone call from  it was  the presidents press secretary he had orders from the president who was very distressed by the news from florida the va was to  1 cooperate with fera in seeing that everything possible be done for those injured in the hurricane  2 see that the bodies were properly cared for shipment home to relatives and that those bodies for which shipment home was not requested be sent to   and 3 conduct a very careful joint investigation with mr hopkins organization to determine whether there was any fault that would lie against anyone in the administration hines representative in florida was to take full charge of the situation and all other organizations and agencies were ordered to cooperate the presidents first order was straight forward and promptly executed 124 injured veterans were treated in miami area hospitals  9 of these died 56 were later transferred to va medical facilities uninjured veterans were removed to camp foster in jacksonville and evaluated for transfer to the ccc  those declining transfer or deemed unemployable were paid off and given tickets home all of the fera transient camps were closed in november 1935 in december 1935 fera itself was absorbed within the new wpa also directed by hopkins recovery 
the second and third orders however were almost immediately compromised at a news conference on september 5 hopkins asserted that there was no negligence traceable to fera in the failed evacuation of the camps as the weather bureau advisories had given insufficient warning he also dispatched his assistant  to florida to coordinate fera efforts and to investigate the deaths williams and hines assistant colonel george e ijams both arrived in miami on september 6 ijams concentrated on the dead their collection identification and proper disposition this was to prove exceptionally difficult bodies were scattered throughout the keys and their rapid decomposition created ghastly conditions state and local health officials demanded a ban on all movement of bodies and their immediate burial or cremation in place  the next day governor sholtz so ordered this was reluctantly agreed to by hines with the understanding that those buried would be later disinterred and shipped home or to arlington when permitted by the state health authorities the cremations began on saturday september 7  38 bodies were burned together at the collection point beside snake creek over the next week 136 bodies were cremated on upper matecumbe key at 12 different locations on lower matecumbe key 82 were burned at 20 sites on numerous small keys in florida bay bodies were either burned or buried where found this effort continued into november 123 bodies had been transported to miami before the embargo these were processed at a temporary morgue staffed by fingerprint experts and 8 volunteer undertakers under tents at woodlawn park cemetery  3260 sw 8th st miami  the intention was to identify the remains and prepare them for burial or further shipment with the embargo in force immediate burial of all the bodies at woodlawn was mandatory fera purchased a plot in section 2a the va coordinated the ceremony with full military honors on september 8 109 bodies were buried in the fera plot  81 veterans 9 civilians and 19 unidentified bodies some records claim 259 veterans were victims of the hurricane

the florida emergency relief administration reported that as of november 19 1935 the total of dead stood at 423  259 veterans and 164 civilians these numbers are reflected on the veterans storm relief map  which see  by march 1 1936 62 additional bodies had been recovered bringing the total to 485  257 veterans and 228 civilians the discrepancy in veterans deaths resulted from the difficulty in identifying bodies particularly those found months after the hurricane and a question of definition  whether to count just those on the camp payrolls or to include others not enrolled who happened to be veterans the   va  compiled its own list of veterans deaths 
121 dead-positive identification 90 missing and 45 dead-identification tentative totaling 256 five others are named in a footnote one proved to be a misidentification of a previously listed veteran  two were state employees working at the camps  and two were unaffiliated veterans caught in the storm this gives a total for all veterans of 260 adding this to the florida emergency relief administration number for civilians gives a total of 488 for all deaths 12 of the dead were listed as  colored   visited the veteran s camp by boat after weathering the hurricane at his home in key west  he wrote about the devastation in a critical article titled  who killed the vets  for  magazine hemingway implied that the  workers and families who were unfamiliar with the risks of florida hurricane season were unwitting victims of a system that appeared to lack concern for their welfare from  statement on the tragedy 
wealthy people yachtsmen fishermen such as president hoover and president roosevelt do not come to the florida keys in hurricane months there is a known danger to property but veterans especially the bonus-marching variety of veterans are not property they are only human beings  unsuccessful human beings and all they have to lose is their lives they are doing coolie labor for a top wage of  45 a month and they have been put down on the florida keys where they can t make trouble it is hurricane months sure but if anything comes up you can always evacuate them can t youit is not necessary to go into the deaths of the civilians and their families since they were on the keys of their own free will  they made their living there had property and knew the hazards involved but the veterans had been sent there  they had no opportunity to leave nor any protection against hurricanes  and they never had a chance for their lives who sent nearly a thousand war veterans many of them husky hard-working and simply out of luck but many of them close to the border of pathological cases to live in frame shacks on the florida keys in hurricane months 

in the same issue of the new masses appeared an editorial charging criminal negligence and a cartoon by russell t limbach captioned an act of god depicting burning corpses a  editorial on sept 5 titled ruin in the veterans  camps stated the widely held opinion that the camps were havens of rest designed to keep bonus marchers away from washington most of these veterans are drifters psychopathic cases or habitual troublemakers those who are nor physically or mentally handicapped have no claim whatsoever to special rewards in return for bonus agitation 
investigation 
williams meanwhile rushed to complete the investigation he finished on sunday september 8 the day an elaborate memorial service and mass burial of hurricane victims  both coordinated by ijams  were held in miami ijams who had been too busy to participate in the investigation and had not questioned any of the 12 witnesses interrogated by williams nonetheless signed the 15 page report to the president that night williams released it to the miami press in a radio broadcast immediately following the memorial ceremony ijams considered the timing unfortunate after receiving several critical telephone messages the report exonerated everyone involved and concluded  to our mind the catastrophe must be characterized as an  and was by its very nature beyond the power of man or instruments at his disposal to foresee sufficiently far enough in advance to permit the taking of adequate precautions capable of preventing the death and desolation which occurred early also found the publicity around the report  unfortunate  in a telegram to his colleague assistant presidential secretary  early wrote that he had authorized hines to proceed with a  complete and exhaustive  joint investigation with hopkins significantly hines was to  instruct his investigator that under no circumstances will any statement be made to the press until final report has been submitted to the president  hopkins gave similar instructions to his investigator mcintyre also was involved in damage control on sept 10 1935 the greater miami ministerial association wrote the president an angry letter labeling the report a   mcintyre forwarded it to fera for a response williams returned a draft for the president s signature on sept 25th insisting the report was only preliminary and that the  final and detailed report  will be both thorough and searching  williams assigned  assistant general counsel for fera to complete the investigation on sept 11 1935 hines directed the skeptical and meticulous david w kennamer to investigate the disaster there was immediate friction between them  kennamer believed abt did not have an open mind and abt felt further investigation was unnecessary working with harry w farmer another va investigator kennamer completed his 2 volume report on october 30 1935 farmer added a third volume concerning the identification of the veterans kennamer s report included 2,168 pages of exhibits 118 pages of findings and a 19 page general comment his findings differed substantially from those of williams citing three officials of the florida emergency relief administration as negligent  administrator conrad van hyning asst administrator fred ghent and camp superintendent ray sheldon  in a response to abt s draft report to the president ijams sided with kennamer hines and hopkins never agreed on a final report and kennamers findings were suppressed they remained so for decades one might speculate that hines wished to avoid a public quarrel with hopkins who had enjoyed roosevelts patronage since his term as new york governor hines was a holdover from the hoover administration such an internal dispute would embarrass the roosevelt administration at the time a vote on the   bonus bill  was upcoming  it passed on jan 27 1936 over the presidents veto  also 1936 was a presidential election year kennamer did appear at the house hearings in april 1936 along with hines ijams williams and the 3 officials he pilloried in his report he was not questioned about his controversial findings nor did he volunteer his opinions on november 1 1935 the american legion completed its own report on the hurricane the legion s national commander ray murphy mailed a copy to president roosevelt it concluded that 
the blame for the loss of life can be placed on  inefficiency indifference and ignorance  inefficiency in the setup of the camps indifference of someone in charge as to the safety of the men ignorance of the real danger from a tropical hurricane and these  i s  can be added together and they spell  murder at matacombe    committee early in its investigation noticed a tendency on the part of some to reflect on the character of the men who were veterans in the camps several parties referred to them as  bums   drunkards   crazy men   riff-raff  and the like they seem to think that  they got what was coming to them 
how anyone could arrive at such a conclusion is impossible for us to determine if these men were  bums   drunkards   crazy men  etc then it was all the more necessary that every precaution be taken to protect them if they fell into this category they were subnormal men and should have been treated as such if they were incapable of caring for themselves then the government should have placed them in hospitals and not have sent them to a wilderness in the high-seas on a so called  rehabilitation program 
others testified that the men were well-behaved and that a great majority of them would have preferred to have been placed under military discipline in the camps but these observations are of no real value except to show that some people are trying to  cover up  the real guilt of responsible parties williams prepared a response for the president stating   a final report based upon the facts obtained in this investigation  will be submitted to me shortly at that time i shall transmit a copy of the report to you for your information and consideration

 there were no turntables on the florida east coast railway below miami in routine operations locomotives were reversed using the   junctions at homestead marathon or key west in this case it was decided to use the homestead way and run the locomotive backward to camp  3 on lower matecumbe and then using a siding move it to the other end of the train facing forward for the return trip using the marathon wye would have allowed running the engine forward on both legs but would have added 45.6 miles to the route much of which was over open water as it happened the hurricane s eye passed directly over the long key crossings caught there the entire train would have been lost in the bay

 6 coaches 2 baggage cars and 3 box cars the box cars were at the rear of the train  being empty and smaller than the other cars they blew off the tracks even before the storm surge arrived stopping the train from continuing past islamorada a close examination of photographs of the wreck show one box car still coupled to the last baggage car the other two broke off completely and were apparently carried by the surge half-way across the key towards the bay two other boxcars were on a siding before the storm and ended up wedged against the sides of coaches 5 and 6 counting back from the locomotive 
  fec co-receiver concluded on sept 6 1935 that the delays likely saved the crew and passengers  if the train had arrived an hour earlier it would have been on lower matecumbe or the narrow indian key fill when the surge struck and destroyed  from what we now know it seems that the men could not have been extracted from the camps unless the train had left miami about 10 00 am  florida hurricane disaster hearings p 504
