space environment is a branch of   and  that seeks to understand and address conditions existing in space that affect the design and operation of spacecraft a related subject  deals with dynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft but that can also affect the atmosphere  and  giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies effects on spacecraft can arise from   and  impact upper  and  radiation in space usually comes from three main sources   i  the    ii   and   and  iii  galactic  for long duration missions the high doses of radiation can damage electronic components and solar cells a major concern is also radiation-induced  single-event effects  such as  manned missions usually avoid the radiation belts and the  is at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts during solar energetic events   and   particles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the earth in times as short as 30 minutes  but usually take some hours  these particles are mainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage disruption to logic circuits and even hazards to astronauts manned missions to return to the moon or to travel to mars will have to deal with the major problems presented by solar particle events to radiation safety in addition to the important contribution to doses from the low-level background  in near-earth orbits the earth s  screens spacecraft from a large part of these hazards  a process called  space debris and meteoroids can impact spacecraft at high speeds causing mechanical or electrical damage the average speed of space debris is 10km s  while the average speed of meteoroids is much greater for example the meteoroids associated with the  travel at an average speed of 58km s mechanical damage from debris impacts have been studied through space missions including  which had over 20,000 documented impacts through its 5.7 year mission electrical anomalies associated with impact events include  s olympus spacecraft which lost attitude control during the 1993 perseid meteor shower a similar event occurred with the  spacecraft during the 2009 perseid meteor shower spacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot  environment around the earth the plasma encountered in the region of the  orbit becomes heated during geomagnetic  caused by disturbances in the solar wind  hot  electrons  with energies in the kilo range  collect on surfaces of spacecraft and can establish electrostatic potentials of the order of kilovolts as a result discharges can occur and are known to be the source of many spacecraft anomalies solutions devised by scientists and engineers include but are not limited to spacecraft shielding special  hardening  of electronic systems various collision detection systems evaluation of effects during spacecraft design includes application of various models of the environment including radiation belt models spacecraft-plasma interaction models and atmospheric models to predict drag effects encountered in lower orbits and during reentery the field often overlaps with the disciplines of    and  albeit usually with an emphasis on application the united states government maintains a  at  the space weather prediction center  swpc  is part of the    swpc is one of the  s  nws    ncep   effects on earth can include  storms temporary decreases in  densities disruption to radio communication to  signals and submarine positioning some scientists also theorize links between  activity and
