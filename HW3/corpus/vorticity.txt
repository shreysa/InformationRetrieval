in  the vorticity is a   that describes the local  motion of a continuum near some point  the tendency of something to rotate   as would be seen by an observer located at that point and traveling along with the flow conceptually vorticity could be determined by marking the part of continuum in a small neighborhood of the point in question and watching their relative displacements as they move along the flow the vorticity vector would be twice the mean  vector of those particles relative to their  oriented according to the  this quantity must not be confused with the angular velocity of the particles relative to some other point more precisely the vorticity is a    defined as the   rotational  of the  u vector the definition can be expressed by the  formula 



where  is the  the vorticity of a  is always perpendicular to the plane of the flow and therefore can be considered a  the vorticity is related to the flow s   line integral of the velocity  along a closed path by the  classical   namely for any   c with  n and area da the circulation d along the  of c is the     da n  where  is the vorticity at the center of c many phenomena such as the blowing out of a candle by a puff of air are more readily explained in terms of vorticity rather than the basic concepts of  and velocity this applies in particular to the formation and motion of

examples 
in a mass of continuum that is rotating like a rigid body the vorticity is twice the  vector of that rotation this is the case for example of water in a tank that has been spinning for a while around its vertical axis at a constant rate the vorticity may be nonzero even when all particles are flowing along straight and parallel  if there is   that is if the flow speed varies across   for example in the  within a pipe with constant  all particles travel parallel to the axis of the pipe  but faster near that axis and practically stationary next to the walls the vorticity will be zero on the axis and maximum near the walls where the shear is largest conversely a flow may have zero vorticity even though its particles travel along curved trajectories an example is the ideal  where most particles rotate about some straight axis with speed inversely proportional to their distances to that axis a small parcel of continuum that does not straddle the axis will be rotated in one sense but sheared in the opposite sense in such a way that their mean angular velocity about their center of mass is zero 
another way to visualize vorticity is to imagine that instantaneously a tiny part of the continuum becomes solid and the rest of the flow disappears if that tiny new solid particle is rotating rather than just moving with the flow then there is vorticity in the flow 
mathematical definition 
mathematically the vorticity of a three-dimensional flow is a pseudovector field usually denoted by  defined as the  or rotational of the velocity field v describing the continuum motion in  



in words the vorticity tells how the velocity vector changes when one moves by an infinitesimal distance in a direction perpendicular to it in a two-dimensional flow where the velocity is independent of the z coordinate and has no z component the vorticity vector is always parallel to the z axis and therefore can be expressed as a scalar field multiplied by a constant unit vector z 



evolution 
the evolution of the vorticity field in time is described by the  which can be derived from the  in many real flows where the viscosity can be neglected  more precisely in flows with high   the vorticity field can be modeled well by a collection of discrete vortices the vorticity being negligible everywhere except in small regions of space surrounding the axes of the vortices this is clearly true in the case of 2-d   i.e 2-d zero viscosity flow  in which case the flowfield can be modeled as a  field on the  vorticity is a useful tool to understand how the ideal potential flow solutions can be perturbed to model real flows in general the presence of viscosity causes a  of vorticity away from the vortex cores into the general flow field this flow is accounted for by the diffusion term in the vorticity transport equation thus in cases of very viscous flows  e.g   the vorticity will be diffused throughout the flow field and it is probably simpler to look at the velocity field than at the vorticity vortex lines and vortex tubes 
a vortex line or vorticity line is a line which is everywhere tangent to the local vorticity vector vortex lines are defined by the relation 



where  is the vorticity vector in cartesian coordinates a vortex tube is the surface in the continuum formed by all vortex-lines passing through a given  reducible  closed curve in the continuum the  strength  of a vortex-tube  also called vortex flux  is the integral of the vorticity across a cross-section of the tube and is the same everywhere along the tube  because vorticity has zero divergence  it is a consequence of   or equivalently of   that in an inviscid fluid the  strength  of the vortex tube is also constant with time viscous effects introduce frictional losses and time dependence in a three dimensional flow vorticity  as measured by the volume integral of its squared magnitude  can be intensified when a vortex-line is extended  a phenomenon known as  this phenomenon occurs in the formation of a bath-tub vortex in out-flowing water and the build-up of a tornado by rising air-currents  is vorticity in motion along a third axis in a corkscrew fashion vorticity meters 
rotating-vane vorticity meter 
a rotating-vane vorticity meter was invented by russian hydraulic engineer a.ya.milovich  1874-1958  in 1913 he proposed a cork with four blades attached as a device qualitatively showing the magnitude of the vertical projection of the vorticity and demonstrated a motion-picture photography of float s motion on the water surface in a model of river bend rotating-vane vorticity meters are commonly shown in educational films on continuum mechanics  famous examples include the ncfmf s  vorticity  and  fundamental principles of flow  by iowa institute of hydraulic research  non-rotating vorticity meters
in  the  distribution over a finite wing may be approximated by assuming that each segment of the wing has a semi-infinite trailing vortex behind it it is then possible to solve for the strength of the vortices using the criterion that there be no flow induced through the surface of the wing this procedure is called the vortex panel method of  the strengths of the vortices are then summed to find the total approximate  about the wing according to the  lift is the product of circulation airspeed and air density atmospheric sciences 
the relative vorticity is the vorticity of the air velocity field relative to the earth this is often modeled as a two-dimensional flow parallel to the ground so that the relative vorticity vector is generally perpendicular to the ground and can then be viewed as a scalar quantity positive when the vector points upward negative when it points downwards therefore vorticity is positive when the wind turns counter-clockwise  looking down onto the earth s surface  in the northern hemisphere positive vorticity is called  and negative vorticity is   the nomenclature is reversed in the southern hemisphere the absolute vorticity is computed from the air velocity relative to an inertial frame and therefore includes a term due to the earth s rotation the  the  is absolute vorticity divided by the vertical spacing between levels of constant   or   the absolute vorticity of an air mass will change if the air mass is stretched  or compressed  in the z direction but the potential vorticity is  in an  flow which predominates in the atmosphere the potential vorticity is therefore useful as an approximate  of air masses over the timescale of a few days particularly when viewed on levels of constant entropy the  is the simplest way for forecasting the movement of   that is the  and  of 500   over a limited amount of time  a few days  in the 1950s the first successful programs for  utilized that equation in modern numerical weather forecasting models and   gcm s  vorticity may be one of the predicted variables in which case the corresponding time-dependent equation is a  helicity of the air motion is important in forecasting  and the potential for  activity see also
