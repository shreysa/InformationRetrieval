despite marginally warm  of around 79f  26c  the effects of below-average air temperatures aloft and low wind shear allowed ophelia to gradually strengthen  with banding features becoming more prominent as it drifted northwards in an area of weak steering currents in addition the large  between the unusually-warm ocean surface  for that time of the year  and the extremely cold temperatures in the upper atmosphere provided instability for ophelia s thunderstorms which allowed the storm to continue strengthening despite being over marginally-warm ocean temperatures a slight degradation of the structure of the storm resulted in some weakening early on 11 october but this was short-lived as deep convection wrapped around the entire storm it was upgraded to a hurricane at 21 00utc that day after a ragged  developed becoming the record-tying tenth consecutive hurricane to form during the 2017 hurricane season  ophelia was the fourth such occurrence since the   and  afterwards ophelia steadily intensified as it became nearly stationary intensifying into a category2 hurricane on the  on 12 october as the  became more symmetric and the eye became better defined the hurricane then weakened slightly the on next day as cloud tops warmed only to quickly strengthen as the eye became much more defined and cloud tops cooled significantly due to  from a strong  to the northeast the nhc upgraded the storm to a major hurricane  category 3 or higher  at 15 00utc on 14 october the farthest east that a storm of such intensity had been observed in the satellite era at the same time it attained its peak intensity with winds of 115mph  185km h  and a minimum pressure of 960millibars  28.35inhg  while located approximately 235miles  375km  southeast of the azores after peaking in intensity increasing shear and dry air from an encroaching frontal boundary began to disrupt the core of the storm which caused ophelia to begin weakening early on 15 october as it began its extratropical transition with the eye collapsing the process accelerated as ophelia became further embedded in the trough and ultimately the storm became extratropical at 03 00utc on the next day preparations and impact
