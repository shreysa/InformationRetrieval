warnings and nomenclature 
each year the  office  mfr  based on  island issues warnings on tropical cyclones within the basin which is defined as the waters of the  from the coast of africa to 90 south of the  the agency issues the warnings as part of its role as a  designated as such in 1993 by the  intensities are estimated through the  which utilizes images from satellites by the american  the   a joint   task force  also issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region wind estimates from mto-france and most other basins throughout the world are  over 10minutes while estimates from the united states-based joint typhoon warning center are sustained over 1minute 1-minute winds are about 1.12 times the amount of 10-minute winds if a tropical storm in the basin strengthens to attain 10minute sustained winds of at least 118km h  74mph  the mfr classifies it as a  equivalent to a  or   a use of  tropical cyclone  which is more restrictive than the usual definition  history of the basin 
the first storm in the database for mfr originated on january11 1848 in january1960 the first  was alex and each subsequent year had a list of storm names beginning in 1967 satellites helped locate cyclones in the basin and in the following year the mfr began estimating storm intensities from the satellite images by 1977 the agency was using the  on an unofficial basis but officially adopted it in 1981 originally the basin only extended to 80e and while it was extended eastward to the current 90e a lack of satellite imagery initially made data uncertain east of 80e the world meteorological organization designated the mfr as a regional tropical cyclones advisory centre in 1988 and upgraded it to a  in 1993 in may 1998 two europe-based  satellites began providing complete coverage of the basin on july1 2002 the mfr shifted the cyclone year to begin on this date and end on june30 of the following year  previously the cyclone year began on august1 and ended on the subsequent july31 in 2003 the mfr extended their area of warning responsibility to 40 having previously been limited at 30s during 2011 mfr started a reanalysis project of all tropical systems between 197898 with methods such as a dvorak technique reanalysis and use of microwave imagery preliminary results from this reanalysis project include correcting an increasing trend in the number of very intense tropical cyclones in the basin since 1978 this also revealed a seemingly systematic underestimation of tropical cyclone intensities in the past statistics 
from the  to the  season there was an average of 9.3tropical storms each year in the basin a tropical storm has 10minute winds of at least 65km h  40mph  there are an average of five storms that become tropical cyclones which have 10 minute winds of at least 120km h  75mph  as of 2002 there was an average of 54days when tropical systems were active in the basin of which 20 had  active or a system with winds of over 120km h  75mph  the median start date for the season was november17 and the median end date was april20 climatology 




tracks of storms in the basin from 1980 to 2005


generally the  does not cross into the  until december  as a result storms rarely form there before that time from 1948 to 2010 94tropical systems developed in the small body of water of which about half made  occasionally small storms form in the mozambique channel that resemble  or storms in the northeastern   these systems are well-organized but have weaker  than typical tropical cyclones and originate over cooler than normal  of less than 26c  79f  a survey in 2004 conducted by weather expert gary padgett found meteorologists split whether these storms should be classified as tropical or  in an average year ten tropical depressions or storms strike madagascar and most generally do not cause much damage occasionally storms or their remnants enter the interior of southeastern africa bringing heavy rainfall to  seasons
