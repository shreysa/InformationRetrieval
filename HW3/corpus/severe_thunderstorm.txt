warm air has a lower  than cool air so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom  this effect can be seen with a   clouds form as relatively warmer air carrying moisture rises within cooler air the moist air rises and as it does so it cools and some of the  in that rising air  when the moisture condenses it releases energy known as  of vaporization which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air continuing the cloud s ascension if enough  is present in the atmosphere this process will continue long enough for  clouds to form and produce  and  meteorological indices such as   cape  and the  can be used to assist in determining potential upward vertical development of clouds generally thunderstorms require three conditions to form 

moisture
an unstable airmass
a lifting force  heat 

all thunderstorms regardless of type go through three stages  the developing stage the mature stage and the dissipation stage the average thunderstorm has a 24km  15mi  diameter depending on the conditions present in the atmosphere each of these three stages take an average of 30 minutes cumulus stage
the first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage during this stage masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere the trigger for this lift can be  where the heating of the ground produces  or where two winds converge forcing air upwards or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation the moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude which appear as  clouds as the water vapor condenses into liquid  is released which warms the air causing it to become less dense than the surrounding drier air the air tends to rise in an  through the process of   hence the term   this process creates a  within and beneath the forming thunderstorm in a typical thunderstorm approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the  mature stage

in the mature stage of a thunderstorm the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther often this  cap  is the  the air is instead forced to spread out giving the storm a characteristic  shape the resulting cloud is called  the water droplets  into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles as these fall they melt to become  if the updraft is strong enough the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as  while updrafts are still present the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it creating  as well the simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds during this stage considerable internal  can occur within which manifests as strong winds severe lightning and even  typically if there is little  the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and  rain itself out  but if there is sufficient change in wind speed or direction the downdraft will be separated from the updraft and the storm may become a  where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours 
dissipating stage

in the dissipation stage the thunderstorm is dominated by the downdraft if atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development this stage occurs rather quickly approximately 2030 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm the downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm hit the ground and spread out this phenomenon is known as a  the cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions which then quickly cuts off its  of relatively warm moist air and kills the thunderstorm s further growth the downdraft hitting the ground creates an  this can cause downbursts a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft the stronger the  is the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes classification




conditions favorable for thunderstorm types and complexes


there are four main types of thunderstorms  single-cell multi-cell squall line  also called multi-cell line  and supercell which type forms depends on the instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere   single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 2030 minutes organized thunderstorms and thunderstorm clusters lines can have longer life cycles as they form in environments of significant vertical wind shear normally greater than 25 knots  13m s  in the lowest 6 kilometres  3.7mi  of the  which aids the development of stronger updrafts as well as various forms of severe weather the supercell is the strongest of the thunderstorms most commonly associated with large hail high winds and tornado formation  values of greater than 31.8 millimetres  1.25in  favor the development of organized thunderstorm complexes those with heavy rainfall normally have precipitable water values greater than 36.9 millimetres  1.45in  upstream values of  of greater than 800 j kg are usually required for the development of organized convection single-cell

preparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm some preparedness takes the form of general readiness  as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year  preparing a family emergency plan for example can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees which can be blown over in high winds can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury the   nws  in the united states recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to occur 



know the names of local counties cities and towns as these are how warnings are described monitor forecasts and weather conditions and know whether thunderstorms are likely in the area be alert for natural signs of an approaching storm cancel or reschedule outdoor events  to avoid being caught outdoors when a storm hits  take action early so you have time to get to a safe place get inside a substantial building or hard-topped metal vehicle before threatening weather arrives if you hear  get to the safe place immediately avoid open areas like hilltops fields and  and don t be or be near the tallest objects in an area when thunderstorms are occurring don t shelter under tall or isolated trees during thunderstorms if in the woods put as much distance between you and any trees during thunderstorms if in a group spread out so that you increase the chances for survivors who could come to the aid of any victims from a  


safety

take action immediately upon hearing thunder anyone close enough to the storm to hear thunder can be struck by lightning avoid electrical appliances including corded telephones  and wireless telephones are safe to use during a thunderstorm close and stay away from windows and doors as glass can become a serious hazard in high wind do not bathe or shower as plumbing conducts  if driving safely exit the roadway turn on hazard lights and park remain in the vehicle and avoid touching metal

lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs in a thunderstorm it can be seen in the form of a bright streak  or bolt  from the sky lightning occurs when an  is built up within a cloud due to static electricity generated by   colliding with  near the  when a large enough charge is built up a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning the temperature of a lightning bolt can be five times hotter than the surface of the sun although the lightning is extremely hot the duration is short and 90 of strike victims survive contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot some people have been struck by lightning over three times and skyscrapers like the  have been struck numerous times in the same storm the loud bang that is heard is the super heated air around the lightning bolt expanding at the  because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is seen before the bang although both occur at the same moment there are several types of lightning 

in-cloud lightning is the most common it is lightning within a cloud and is sometimes called intra-cloud or sheet lightning cloud to ground lightning is when a bolt of lightning from a cloud strikes the ground this form poses the greatest threat to life and property ground to cloud lightning is when a lightning bolt is induced from the ground to the cloud cloud to cloud lightning is rarely seen and is when a bolt of lightning arcs from one cloud to another  is extremely rare and has several hypothesized explanations it is seen in the form of a 15 to 50 centimeter radius ball  is when lightning from a cloud hits air of a different charge  is a misnomer that refers to a thunderstorm whose precipitation does not reach the ground  refers to a lightning flash that is seen from the horizon that does not have accompanying thunder  occurs above the thunderhead  is used widely to describe lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it in the u.s and  a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not be observable  either visually or audibly  from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes european and asian mountainous areas experience similar events also in clear areas where the storm cell is on the near horizon  within 26km  16mi  a strike can occur and as the storm is so far away the strike is referred to as clear-air

in more contemporary times thunderstorms have taken on the role of a scientific curiosity every spring  head to the  of the united states and the canadian prairies to explore the scientific aspects of storms and tornadoes through use of videotaping radio pulses produced by cosmic rays are being used to study how electric charges develop within thunderstorms more organized meteorological projects such as  use an array of sensors such as the  vehicles with mounted automated   and unmanned aircraft to investigate thunderstorms expected to produce severe weather lightning is detected remotely using sensors that detect cloud-to-ground lightning strokes with 95percent accuracy in detection and within 250 metres  820ft  of their point of origin mythology and religion
