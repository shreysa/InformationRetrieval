seal of the u.s supreme court


article iii section i of the constitution establishes the  and authorizes the united states congress to establish inferior  i.e lower  courts as their need shall arise section i also establishes a lifetime tenure for all federal judges and states that their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office article ii section ii establishes that all federal judges are to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the  the  subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into  and created federal courts for each district the three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of the national judiciary  the supreme court 13 courts of appeals 94 district courts and two courts of special jurisdiction congress retains the power to re-organize or even abolish federal courts lower than the supreme court the u.s supreme court adjudicates  matters pertaining to the federal government disputes between states and interpretation of the united states constitution and in general can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as  nullifying the law and creating  for future law and decisions the united states constitution does not specifically mention the power of   the power to declare a law unconstitutional  the power of judicial review was asserted by  in the landmark supreme court case   1803  there have been instances in the past where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches below the u.s supreme court are the  and below them in turn are the  which are the general trial courts for federal law and for certain controversies between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state   there are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction meaning that these courts handle criminal cases and civil lawsuits between individuals other courts such as the  and the  are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases   the bankruptcy courts are  under  the supervision of the district courts and as such are not considered part of the   judiciary and also as such their judges do not have lifetime tenure nor are they constitutionally exempt from diminution of their remuneration also the tax court is not an article iii court  but is instead an  article i court  the district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are considered under the judicial code  title 28 united states code  consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of   and  diversity jurisdiction  and   can be filed and decided the district courts can also hear cases under   wherein a case brought in state court meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction and one party litigant chooses to  remove  the case from state court to federal court the united states courts of appeals are appellate courts that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts and some direct appeals from administrative agencies and some interlocutory appeals the u.s supreme court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts and in addition has  over a few cases the judicial power extends to cases arising under the constitution an   a u.s   cases affecting   and  of foreign countries in the u.s  cases and controversies to which the federal government is a party  controversies between states  or their citizens  and foreign nations  or their citizens or subjects  and bankruptcy cases  collectively  federal-question jurisdiction  the  removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant it did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant the power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress and to criminal cases arising under federal law the interplay of the supremacy clause and article iii has resulted in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to  state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law and a handful of federal claims are primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts  for example those arising from the   both court systems thus can be said to have  in some areas and  in others the u.s constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office  during good behavior  in practice this usually means they serve until they die retire or resign a judge who commits an offense while in office may be  in the same way as the president or other officials of the federal government u.s judges are appointed by the president subject to confirmation by the senate another constitutional provision prohibits congress from reducing the pay of any article iii judge  congress is able to set a lower salary for all future judges that take office after the reduction but may not decrease the rate of pay for judges already in office  relationships between state and federal courts
separate from but not entirely independent of this federal court system are the court systems of each state each dealing with in addition to federal law when not deemed preempted a state s own laws and having its own court rules and procedures although state governments and the federal government are legally dual sovereigns the supreme court of the united states is in many cases the appellate court from the state supreme courts  e.g absent the court countenancing the applicability of the   the  are by this doctrine the final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state s laws and constitution many state constitution provisions are equal in breadth to those of the u.s constitution but are considered  parallel   thus where for example the right to privacy pursuant to a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy and the asserted ground is explicitly held to be  independent  the question can be finally decided in a state supreme courtthe u.s supreme court will decline to take jurisdiction  a state supreme court other than of its own accord is bound only by the u.s supreme court s interpretation of federal law but is not bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the federal circuit in which the state is included or even the federal district courts located in the state a result of the dual sovereigns concept conversely a federal district court hearing a matter involving only a question of state law  usually through   must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits a result of the application of the   however at the same time the case is heard under the  the  and the  instead of state procedural rules  that is the application of the erie doctrine only extends to a requirement that a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply substantive state law but not procedural state law which may be different  together the laws of the federal and state governments form  elections and voting

the state governments tend to have the greatest influence over most americans  daily lives the  prohibits the federal government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the states in the constitution  as a result states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals within their jurisdiction because state governments are not authorized to print currency they generally have to raise revenue through either taxes or bonds as a result state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts or raise taxes any time the economy is faltering each state has its own written constitution government and code of laws the constitution stipulates only that each state must have  a republican government  therefore there are often great differences in law and procedure between individual states concerning issues such as property crime health and education amongst others the highest elected official of each state is the  each state also has an elected    is a feature of every state except   whose members represent the voters of the state each state maintains its own  system in some states supreme and lower court justices are elected by the people  in others they are appointed as they are in the federal system as a result of the supreme court case   are considered  domestic dependent nations  that operate as  governments subject to federal authority but in some cases outside of the jurisdiction of state governments hundreds of laws executive orders and court cases have modified the governmental status of tribes  individual states but the two have continued to be recognized as separate bodies tribal governments vary in robustness from a simple council used to manage all aspects of tribal affairs to large and complex bureaucracies with several branches of government tribes are currently encouraged to form their own governments with power resting in elected tribal councils elected tribal chairpersons or religiously appointed leaders  as is the case with   tribal citizenship and voting rights are typically restricted to individuals of native descent but tribes are free to set whatever citizenship requirements they wish the institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically town city or county boards water management districts fire management districts library districts and other similar governmental units which make laws that affect their particular area these laws concern issues such as traffic the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals the highest elected official of a town or city is usually the  in  towns operate in a  fashion and in some states such as   and some parts of  counties have little or no power existing only as geographic distinctions in other areas county governments have more power such as to collect taxes and maintain  agencies see also

 contrary to common misconception residents of puerto rico do pay u.s federal taxes  customs taxes  which are subsequently returned to the puerto rico treasury   see   june 10 2012 at the  import export taxes  see   april 1 2010 at the  federal commodity taxes  see   social security taxes  see  residents pay federal  such as   see  and   see  as well as commonwealth of puerto rico income taxes  see  and   april 29 2011 at the  all federal employees  see   february 10 2010 at the  those who do business with the federal government  see   january 16 2010 at  puerto rico-based corporations that intend to send funds to the u.s  see  and some others  for example puerto rican residents that are members of the u.s military see  and puerto rico residents who earned income from sources outside puerto rico see  also pay federal income taxes in addition because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the u.s irs code and because the per-capita income in puerto rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland more puerto rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the irs code were applied to the island this occurs because  the commonwealth of puerto rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do u.s state and local governments   see  as residents of puerto rico pay into social security puerto ricans are eligible for social security benefits upon retirement but are excluded from the   ssi   commonwealth of puerto rico residents unlike residents of the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands and residents of the 50 states do not receive the ssi see  and the island actually receives less than 15 of the  funding it would normally receive if it were a u.s state however medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico even though the latter paid fully into the system  see   may 11 2011 at the  it has also been estimated  see  that because the population of the island is greater than that of 50 of the states if it were a state puerto rico would have six to eight seats in the house in addition to the two seats in the senate see    june 10 2009 at the  and   note that for the later the official us congress database website you will need to resubmit a query the document in question is called  house report 110-597    these are the steps to follow     committee reports   110   drop down  word phrase  and pick  report number    type  597  next to report number this will provide the document  house report 110-597    then from the table of contents choose  background and need for legislation   another misconception is that the import export taxes collected by the u.s on products manufactured in puerto rico are all returned to the puerto rico treasury this is not the case such import export taxes are returned only for rum products and even then the us treasury keeps a portion of those taxes  see the  house report 110-597    mentioned above
