the lrltran compiler extensive software problems confront an organization which possesses a number of different computers and which frequently acquires new ones to maintain cohesion a system must be developed written in a high level language which minimizes machine dependencies and isolates those which are necessary a language and a compiler for the language are discussed here the language called lrltran is a heavily augmented FORTRAN. the tree-pass compiler makes use internally of a postfix polish notation pass i to pass ii and a tree representation referred to as a composite blocking table pass i to pass iii machine-independent optimization occurs in pass ii and do-loop and machine-dependent optimization in pass III. cacm November, 1968 Mendicino, S.
