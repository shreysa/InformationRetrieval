linguists refer to the maya language as yucatec or yucatec maya to distinguish it from other  this norm has often been misinterpreted to mean that the people are also called yucatec maya  that term refers only to the language and the correct name for the people is simply maya  not mayans  maya is one language in the mayan language family thus to refer to maya as mayans would be similar to referring to spanish people as romantics because they speak a language belonging to the romance language family confusion of the term maya mayan as an ethnic label occurs because maya women who use traditional dress identify by the ethnic term mestiza and not maya persons use a strategy of ethnic identification that juan castillo cocom refers to as  ethnoexodus meaning that ethnic self-identification as maya is quite variable situational and articulated not to processes of producing group identity but of escaping from discriminatory processes of sociocultural marginalization the yucatn s indigenous population was first exposed to europeans after a party of spanish shipwreck survivors came ashore in 1511 one of the sailors  is reported to have taken up with a local woman and started a family  he became a counselor among a local polity near present-day  later spanish expeditions to the region were led by  in 1517  in 1518 and  in 1519 from 1528 to 1540 several attempts by  to conquer the yucatn failed his son francisco de montejo the younger fared almost as badly when he first took over  while desperately holding out at chichen itza he lost 150 men in a single day european diseases massive recruitment of native warriors from campeche and champoton and internal hatred between the xiu maya and the lords of cocom eventually turned the tide for montejo the younger  was conquered by 1570 in 1542 the western yucatn peninsula also surrendered to him

there is an undeniable symbiotic relationship between cultural heritage tourism and a national identity in the case of the maya the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism by focusing on lifeways through costumes rituals diet handicrafts language housing or other features the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture global tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods services and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change estimated that between 35 and 40 percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples as well as sites and objects of global historical significance in this production of tourism the use of historic symbols signs and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building with this type of tourism people argue that ethno-commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds tourists travel with cultural expectations which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings an example of this can be seen in mayanizing tourism on roatan island honduras  archaeological perspectives on heritage development and indignity alejandro j figueroa et al combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on roatan island honduras have become increasingly mayanized over the past decade as tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized maya past for the island non-maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed while heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups notable maya people
