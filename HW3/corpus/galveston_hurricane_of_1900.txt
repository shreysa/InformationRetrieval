meteorological history 




map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the 


the storm s origins are unclear because of the limited observation ability at the end of the 19th century ship reports were the only reliable tool for observing hurricanes at sea and because  was in its infancy these reports were not available until the ships put in at a harbor the 1900 storm like many powerful atlantic hurricanes is believed to have begun as a a  moving off the western coast of africa the first formal sighting of the hurricane s precursor occurred on august 27 about 1,000 miles  1,600km  east of the  when a ship recorded an area of  unsettled weather  the storm passed through the  on august 30 probably as a tropical depression as indicated by  reports from  three days later antigua reported a  passing over followed by the hot humid calmness that often occurs after the passage of a tropical cyclone by september 1  observers were reporting on a  storm of moderate intensity  not a hurricane  southeast of  continuing westward the storm made landfall on southwest cuba on september 3 dropping heavy rains on september 5 it emerged into the  as a tropical storm or a weak hurricane the weather bureau ignored reports from cuban meteorologists because they expected the storm to curve northeast along the coast of north america   assumption became fact as the official government reports stated wrongly that the storm was traveling northeast in the atlantic  however a region of high pressure had pushed the storm to the west into the gulf of mexico the storm was reported to be north of  on september 6 and in the early morning hours of friday september 7 the weather bureau office in new orleans louisiana issued a report of heavy damage along the  and  coasts details of the storm were not widespread  damage to telegraph lines limited communication the weather bureau s central office in washington d.c ordered storm warnings raised from  to galveston by the afternoon of september 7 large swells from the southeast were observed on the gulf and clouds at all altitudes began moving in from the northeast both of these observations are consistent with a hurricane approaching from the east the galveston weather bureau office raised its double square flags  a  was in effect the ship louisiana encountered the hurricane at 1p.m that day after departing new orleans captain halsey estimated wind speeds of 100mph  160km h  these winds correspond to a category2 hurricane in the modern-day

by early afternoon on saturday september 8 a steady northeastern wind had picked up by 5p.m the bureau office was recording sustained hurricane-force winds that night the wind direction shifted to the east and then to the southeast as the hurricane s eye began to pass over the island just west of the city by 11p.m the wind was southerly and diminishing on sunday morning clear skies and a 20mph  30km h  breeze off the gulf of mexico greeted the galveston survivors the storm continued on and later tracked into  from there it continued over the  while still sustaining winds of almost 40mph  as recorded over   and passed north of  nova scotia on september 12 1900 from there it traveled into the north atlantic where it disappeared from observations after decimating a schooner fleet fishing off the coast of  background

at the end of the 19th century the city of galveston texas was a booming town with a population of 36,000residents its position on the natural harbor of  along the  made it the center of trade and one of the biggest cities in the state of texas with this prosperity came a sense of complacency a quarter of a century earlier the nearby town of  on  was undergoing its own boom and was second to galveston among texas port cities then in 1875 a powerful hurricane blew through nearly destroying the town indianola was rebuilt though a  caused residents to simply give up and move elsewhere many galveston residents took the destruction of indianola as an object lesson on the threat posed by hurricanes galveston is built on a  little more than a large  along the  these residents proposed a  be constructed to protect the city but their concerns were dismissed by the majority of the population and the city s government since its formal founding in 1839 the city of galveston had weathered numerous storms all of which the city survived with ease residents believed any future storms would be no worse than previous events in order to provide an official  statement on the threat of hurricanes galveston weather bureau section director  wrote an 1891 article in the  in which he argued not only that a seawall was not needed to protect the city but also that it would be impossible for a hurricane of significant strength to strike the island the seawall was not built and development activities on the island actively increased its vulnerability to storms  along the shore were cut down to fill low areas in the city removing what little barrier there was to the gulf of mexico preparations 
on september 4 the galveston office of the   as it was then called  began receiving warnings from the bureau s central office in washington d.c that a  tropical storm  had moved northward over cuba the weather bureau forecasters had no way of knowing where the storm was or where it was going at the time they discouraged the use of terms such as tornado or hurricane to avoid panicking residents in the path of any storm event conditions in the  were ripe for further strengthening of the storm the gulf had seen little cloud cover for several weeks and the seas were as warm as bathwater according to one report for a storm system that feeds off moisture the gulf of mexico was enough to boost the storm from a tropical storm to a hurricane in a matter of days with further strengthening likely

weather bureau forecasters believed the storm would travel northeast and affect the mid-atlantic coast  to them the storm appeared to have begun a long turn or  recurve  that would take it first into florida then drive it northeast toward an eventual exit into the atlantic  cuban forecasters adamantly disagreed saying the hurricane would continue west one cuban forecaster predicted the hurricane would continue into central texas near  early the next morning the swells continued despite only partly cloudy skies largely because of the unremarkable weather few residents heeded the warning few people evacuated across galveston s bridges to the mainland and the majority of the population was unconcerned by the rain clouds that began rolling in by midmorning  claimed that he took it upon himself to travel along the beach and other low-lying areas warning people personally of the storm s approach these reports by cline and his brother galveston meteorologist joseph l cline have been called into question in recent years as no other survivors corroborated these accounts in fact cline s role in the disaster is the subject of some controversy supporters point to cline s issuing a hurricane warning without permission from the bureau s central office  detractors  including author   point to cline s earlier insistence that a seawall was unnecessary and his belief that an intense hurricane could not strike the island impact
the first train to reach galveston left  on the morning of september 8 at 9 45a.m it found the tracks washed out and passengers were forced to transfer to a relief train on parallel tracks to complete their journey even then debris on the track slowed the train s progress to a crawl the 95 travelers on the train from  found themselves at the  waiting for the  that would carry them train and all to the island when it arrived the high seas forced the ferry captain to give up on his attempt to dock the train crew attempted to return the way they had come but rising water blocked the train s path ten refugees from the beaumont train sought shelter at the  with 200 residents of  who were already there the 85 who stayed with the train died when the  overran the tops of the cars galveston 

at the time of the 1900 storm the highest point in the city of galveston was only 8.7 feet  2.7m  above sea level the hurricane brought with it a  of over 15 feet  4.6m  that washed over the entire island the surge knocked buildings off their foundations and the surf pounded them to pieces over 3,600homes were destroyed and a wall of debris faced the ocean the few buildings that survived mostly solidly built mansions and houses along the  are today maintained as tourist attractions the highest measured wind speed was 100 miles per hour  160km h  just after 6p.m but the weather bureau s  was blown off the building shortly after that measurement was recorded the eye passed over the city around 8p.m maximum winds were estimated at 120mph  190km h  at the time though later estimates placed the hurricane at the higher category4 classification on the  the lowest recorded  was 28.48  964.4  considered at the time to be so low as to be obviously in error modern estimates later placed the storm s central pressure at 27.49inhg  930.9hpa  but this was subsequently adjusted to the storm s official lowest measured central pressure of 27.63inhg  935.7hpa

as severe as the damage to the city s buildings was the human toll was even greater because of the destruction of the bridges to the mainland and the telegraph lines no word of the city s destruction was able to reach the mainland at 11a.m on september 9 one of the few ships at the galveston wharfs to survive the storm the pherabe arrived in  on the western side of galveston bay it carried six messengers from the city when they reached the telegraph office in houston at 3a.m on september 10 a short message was sent to texas   and u.s president    i have been deputized by the mayor and citizen s committee of galveston to inform you that the city of galveston is in ruins  the messengers reported an estimated five hundred dead  this was considered to be an exaggeration at the time the citizens of houston knew a powerful storm had blown through and had made ready to provide assistance workers set out by rail and ship for the island almost immediately rescuers arrived to find the city completely destroyed it is believed 8,000people20 of the island s populationhad lost their lives estimates range from 6,000 to 12,000 most had  or been crushed as the waves pounded the  that had been their homes hours earlier many survived the storm itself but died after several days being trapped under the wreckage of the city with rescuers unable to reach them the rescuers could hear the screams of the survivors as they walked on the debris trying to rescue those they could a further 30,000 were left homeless 



so many died that corpses were piled onto carts for  

the dead bodies were so numerous that burying all of them was impossible the dead were initially weighted down on barges and dumped at sea but when the gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach a new solution was needed  were set up on the beaches or wherever dead bodies were found and burned day and night for several weeks after the storm the authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for the gruesome work of collecting and burning the dead more people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in all the tropical cyclones that have struck the united states since this count is greater than 300 cyclones as of 2009 the galveston hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in u.s history midwest 
the storm maintained tropical characteristics and saffirsimpson tropical storm-force winds  3950mph  when it crossed the upper midwest with more than 4   100  of rain being reported over most of the southern third of wisconsin wind created problems all over including over lake michigan and other areas in the path of the storm had similar problems  tropical storms reach wisconsin and surrounding areas to the east west and south once every 50 years on average with others in the 19th century 1961 and  subject to debate   in 2008   hit twice to three times every two years  and  and depressions hit equally or more rarely than their tropical counterparts 
the rapidly moving storm was still exhibiting winds of 65mph  105km h  by the time it reached new york city on september 12 1900  reported that pedestrian-walking became difficult and that one death was attributed to the storm a sign pole snapped by wind landed on a 23-year-old man crushing his skull and killing him instantly while two others were knocked unconscious awnings and signs on many buildings broke and the canvas roofing at the fire department headquarters was blown off closer to the waterfront along the  waves and tides were reported to be some of the highest in recent memory of the fishermen and sailors spray and debris were thrown over the wall making working along the waterfront dangerous small craft in  were thrown off course and tides and currents in the  made navigation difficult in  the new york times reported that trees were uprooted signs and similar structures were blown down and yachts were torn from moorings with some suffering severe damage because of the direction of the wind  escaped the fury of the storm though a bathing pavilion at  suffered damage from wind and waves canada 

from september 1214 the  of the galveston hurricane affected six  resulting in severe damage and extensive loss of life peak winds reached 5080mph  80125km h  in  during the storm a fire broke out at a flour mill in  resulting in  350,000 in damage to the mill and 50 other stores and offices total crop damage in  alone amounted to  1million  1900 usd  maximum rainfall reached 3.9inches  100mm  in  the majority of loss of life occurred due to numerous shipwrecks off the coast of   and  the overall death toll in canada is estimated to be between 52 and 232 making this at least the eighth deadliest hurricane to affect canada the large discrepancy between the fatality figures is due to the fact that many people were reported missing in saint pierre and miquelon and later presumed to be dead aftermath 

in less than 24 hours the city of galveston was effectively obliterated the final death toll is not known with certainty but the most conservative estimate is around 6,000 most historians believe the loss of life to be in the area of 8,000 with some suggesting as many as 12,000 perished with the city in ruins and rail lines to the mainland destroyed the survivors had little to live on until relief arrived rebuilding 
survivors set up temporary shelters in surplus  tents along the shore they were so numerous that observers began referring to galveston as the  white city on the beach  others constructed so-called  storm lumber  homes using salvageable material from the debris to build shelter reporter  a young journalist working for  was the first reporter on the line at the flood s aftermath she delivered an exclusive set of reports and hearst sent relief supplies by train by september 12 galveston received its first post-storm mail the next day basic water service was restored and  began providing minimal  service within three weeks cotton was again being shipped out of the port before the hurricane of 1900 galveston was considered to be a beautiful and prestigious city and was known as the   of the west  and the   of the southwest  however after the storm development shifted north to houston which was enjoying the benefits of the  boom the dredging of the  in 1909 and 1914 ended galveston s hopes of regaining its former status as a major commercial center protection

to prevent future storms from causing destruction like that of the 1900 hurricane many improvements to the island were made the first 3 miles  4.8km  of the  17-foot  5m  high were built beginning in 1902 under the direction of  an all-weather bridge was constructed to the mainland to replace the ones destroyed in the storm the most dramatic effort to protect the city was its raising dredged sand was used to raise the city of galveston by as much as 17 feet  5.2m  above its previous elevation over 2,100buildings were raised in the process by the process of pumping sand underneath including the 3,000-ton st patrick s church the seawall and raising of the island were jointly named a  by the  in 2001 in 1915 a storm similar in strength and track to the 1900 hurricane struck galveston the  brought a 12-ft  4-m  storm surge that tested the new seawall although 53people on  lost their lives in the 1915 storm this was a great reduction from the thousands who died in 1900 the galveston city government was reorganized into a  a newly devised structure wherein the government is made of a small group of commissioners each responsible for one aspect of governance this was prompted by fears that the existing city council would be unable to handle the problem of rebuilding the city today galveston is home to a cruise port two universities and a major insurance corporation homes and other buildings that survived the hurricane have been preserved and give much of the city a  look the seawall since extended to 10 miles  16km  is now an attraction itself as hotels and tourist attractions have been built along its length in seeming defiance of future storms the last reported survivor of the galveston hurricane of 1900 mrs maude conic of  died november 14 2004 at the claimed age of 116 although the 1910 census and other records indicate she was younger than that historiography 
in  the hurricane and the rebuilding afterward divide what is known as the golden era  18751900  from the   19201957  of galveston the most important long-term impact of the hurricane was to confirm fears that galveston was a dangerous place to make major investments in shipping and manufacturing operations  the economy of the golden era was no longer possible as investors fled in 1920  and tax law enforcement opened up new opportunities for  related to gambling and  in the city galveston rapidly became a prime  destination enabled by the open  businesses on the island this new entertainment-based economy brought decades-long prosperity to the island the galveston historical foundation maintains the texas seaport museum at pier 21 in the port of galveston included in the museum is a documentary titled the great storm that gives a recounting of the 1900 hurricane gallery
