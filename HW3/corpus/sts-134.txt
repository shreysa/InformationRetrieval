sts-134  launch


the  had been scheduled to be retired from service after  but controversy over the cancellation of several  components most notably the  in order to meet deadlines for the retirement of the shuttle caused the  to consider ordering an additional mission on 19 june 2008 the  passed the nasa authorization act of 2008 giving  funding for one additional mission to  deliver science experiments to the station  the same mandate was included in the u.s senate version of the nasa authorization act that was unanimously approved by the senate committee on commerce science and transportation on 25 june 2008 it was amended and passed by the full senate on 25 september 2008 passed by the house on 27 september 2008 and signed by president  on 15 october 2008 bush had previously opposed any additional shuttle missions as they could delay the transition to  in the spring of 2009 the obama administration included funds for the sts-134 mission in its proposed 2010 nasa budget sts-134 was planned to be the final regularly scheduled mission of the nasa space shuttle program but with the passing in 2011 of an appropriations bill authorizing the conversion of  to  this was no longer the case it was also originally scheduled to coincide with  before delays in the space shuttle launch schedule pushed it past that expedition if sts-134 had launched during expedition 26 then mark kelly and expedition 26 commander  would have become the first siblings  and twins  to fly in space at the same time shuttle commander mark kelly s wife   flew to the   ksc  in florida to view the first launch attempt her first trip since moving from  to  for rehabilitation after being seriously wounded in the  on 16 may giffords was again at ksc for the launch which was  one of the most anticipated in years  according to   scheduled a visit to kennedy space center on 29 april 2011 to view the launch and despite the canceled launch attempt he toured an  at  and met with giffords and the six crewmembers mission payload

the   elc3  carried several orbital replacement units  oru  that were too large or too heavy for other spacecraft to carry to the iss these orus included a high pressure gas tank  hpgt  an ammonia tank assembly  ata  the  antenna sub-system assembly  2   3  sasa  a   spdm  arm with orbital replacement unit change-out mechanism a space test program houston 3  payload and a spare elc pallet controller avionics box materials on international space station experiment 
the sts-134 mission delivered the   misse  experiments and returned the completed misse 7 experiments to earth misse 7 had been delivered to the iss on  in 2009 sensor test of orion rel-nav risk mitigation detailed test objective kit 
the orion rel-nav sensor was mounted on the orbiter docking system  ods  in  slot 1 and on an adaptive payload carrier in the bay 3 port of the payload bay for the storrm detailed test objective  dto  after endeavour undocked it completed its normal fly-around of the station the crew then guided endeavour back towards the station flying a nominal orbiter trajectory for docking to the iss s  however the shuttle did not actually dock with the iss again  instead it was positioned below the station on  the docking target on the iss was enhanced with reflectors to allow for the characterization of the orion rel-nav sensors  performance during sts-134 s rendezvous and proximity operations with the iss these proximity operations were tested during approach and docking undocking flyaround  time permitting  and during a modified separation from the iss during the modified separation the crew performed a series of re-rendezvous burns that put the orbiter on an orion-like rendezvous profile afterwards instead of re-docking to the iss the crew performed a full separation glacier freezer module 
sts-134 carried a new  module to the iss and returned two old ones to earth the glacier units were used to store and return science samples on the space shuttle orbiter boom sensor system 




the newly attached  at the  

sts-134 left its   obss  permanently on the iss for use in reaching places that the  cannot get to on its own the usefulness of having an obss available for use at the station was demonstrated during  s repair of the torn p6 solar panel on  the feasibility of leaving an obss attached to iss for a long period of time was demonstrated when the  mission left one behind for use during the subsequent  mission lego kits 
endeavour brought 13  kits to the iss where astronauts built lego models to see how they would react in microgravity as part of the lego bricks in space program the results were shared with schools as part of an educational project shuttle life 
the  precursor mission was launched aboard endeavour this  project was to test the mission destined for  the stage rehearsal was deemed fully successful stem bars 
endeavour brought specialized nutrition bars called  stem bars  to the iss these were created by high school students and sisters mikayla and shannon diesch the nutrition bars were certified for spaceflight by meeting a specific nasa-developed nutritional profile and had to pass strict microbial testing the stem bars were flown to support the work of thebased sisters to raise awareness of the importance of  among their peers an outreach effort which they started after they won the 2010  spirit of innovation awards the little mole 
a  of the  was successfully brought back to earth by  it was later presented to the character s creator  and used for space science popularization mainly in the czech republic mission experiments 
endeavour performed four  payloads of opportunity  maui seiti rambo-2 and simplex all four of these experiments required engine and thruster firings and were to be completed only if there was sufficient propellant on board endeavour mission milestones

endeavour lifted off from  s  at 08 56 edt on 16 may 2011 the launch of endeavour came after an on-time tanking process which filled the shuttle s  with more than 1,900,000l  500,000 us gallons  of  and   the tanking started at 23 36 edt on 15 may 2011 once the shuttle and crew were on-orbit they set about preparing the shuttle for the mission ahead the first tasks they completed were opening the payload bay doors activating the  antenna and activating the shuttle remote manipulator system  srms  also known as the  prior to this commander  and pilot  completed an engine firing known as the oms-2 burn to circularize the orbit of the shuttle they also completed another engine firing the nc-1 burn to help the shuttle catch up to the   iss  after completing these initial tasks the crew activated the  allowing it to be monitored by teams on the ground later in the crew s work day they downlinked video recordings that had been shot of the external tank by mission specialist

on flight day 6 the members of endeavour s crew performed a focused inspection of an area of thermal protection tiles on the bottom of the orbiter the tiles were damaged during launch and detailed data provided by the   obss  was needed to make sure the orbiter could re-enter earth s atmosphere safely the focused inspection started with the  grappling the obss in the middle of the boom and handing it off to the shuttle s  which was controlled by pilot greg johnson and mission specialists mike fincke and roberto vittori the inspection process took approximately two hours to complete and resulted in the   tps  being cleared for entry after the inspection was complete fincke joined drew feustel to get their spacesuits ready for the second spacewalk of the mission on flight day 7 the pair performed the standard overnight campout procedure to get ready for the  later in the crew day the sts-134 crew assembled with the  crew in the  module the joint crew spoke with  answering several questions asked by the pope 22 may  flight day 7  eva 2

wake-up calls 
nasa began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the  and first used music to wake up a flight crew during  each track is specially chosen often by the astronauts  families and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew or is applicable to their daily activities nasa opened the selection process to the public for the first time for  where the public was invited to vote on two songs used to wake up astronauts on previous missions to wake up the sts-133 crew for sts-134 the public was invited to submit original songs with two songs being selected to wake up the crew of endeavour
