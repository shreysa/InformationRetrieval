after maintaining category5 status for about 18hours hurricane ioke weakened slightly due to an  completing the cycle on august 26 the hurricane restrengthened to category5 status the trough to its west tracked further away from the hurricane allowing the subtropical ridge to build ahead of the hurricane which turned ioke to the southwest the overall environment remained very favorable for sustainment of the powerful cyclone strong upper-level cyclones far to its northwest provided outflow channels and light wind shear with warm water temperatures along its path with the conditions the  hurricane model predicted ioke to reach winds of 220mph  350km h  with a predicted minimum pressure of 860mbar  25inhg  early on august 27 the pressure dropped to 915mbar  27.0inhg  and shortly thereafter ioke crossed the  becoming a 160mph  255km h  typhoon unofficially referred as a  by the   jtwc  ioke remained at the equivalence of a category5 hurricane for about 12hours after crossing the date line it then began a slight weakening trend on august 28 due to increased  from the ridge to its north on august 29 the cyclone turned to the west and west-northwest while tracking around the periphery of the subtropical ridge and ioke again reached the equivalence of category5 status the   jma  assessed ioke as attaining peak 10minute sustained winds of 120mph  195km h  on august 30 later that day the typhoon weakened to the equivalent of a category4 hurricane for the final time and on august 31 ioke passed very near  with winds of about 155mph  250km h  by september 1 increased wind shear and drier air caused the eye of ioke to become cloud-filled and elongated and by september 2 ioke was undergoing another eyewall replacement cycle on september 2 ioke passed about 50mi  80km  north of  with winds of about 125mph  200km h  gradual weakening continued and the typhoon steadily shifted its track to the northwest around the subtropical ridge a deepening  turned ioke to the north-northwest and north and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm a few hundred miles east of  after accelerating northeastward the cyclone began losing tropical characteristics and the jtwc declared ioke as an  on september 5 the jma maintained ioke as a typhoon until a day later and maintained ioke as a tropical cyclone until it was declared extratropical midday on september 6 the extratropical remnants of ioke were tracked by the jma until september 7 when it was located near the  of  the storm deepened as it approached the aleutians and re-developed winds of hurricane-force the storm entered the  on september 8 and after turning eastward crossed the aleutian islands and entered the  the extratropical remnants of ioke dissipated near southeastern  on september 12 preparations and impact

hurricane ioke became one of five hurricanes to reach  status on the  in the central north pacific ocean and the only one originating in the basin with an estimated minimum central pressure of 915  27.019  the cyclone attained the lowest estimated surface pressure for any hurricane within the basin surpassing the previous minimum set by  in  ioke maintained at least category4 status for 198consecutive hours which was the longest continuous time period at that intensity ever observed for any tropical cyclone anywhere on earth additionally the cyclone remained at the equivalence of a  for 174consecutive hours which was also a record as a result of its extended duration and intensity hurricane typhoon ioke accrued an  index of 82 which set a new worldwide record the  first performed an aerial assessment of damage on  on september 2 three days after the typhoon struck the flight indicated an overall damage smaller than expected and reported a lack of oil spill or hazardous material leak the u.s coast guard arrived by boat with a team on september 7 with a preliminary damage assessment completed four days later  the team repaired a generator to provide power the  s combat stores ship the  and sixteen members  s  at  guam arrived on september 8 and analyzed the stability of the airfield along with assisting in clean-up efforts and after core tests workers cleared the runway to allow flights onto the territory on september 13 a group of engineers restored power on the island about two weeks after the cyclone several buildings were operational the central pacific hurricane center requested the retirement of the name and in april 2007 the name ioke was retired and replaced with iopa see also
