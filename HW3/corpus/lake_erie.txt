lake erie and   map the deepest point is marked with   

lake erie was carved out by glacier ice and in its current form is less than 4,000 years old which is a short span in geological terms before this the land on which the lake now sits went through several complex stages a large lowland basin formed over two million years ago as a result of an eastern flowing river that existed well before the  this ancient drainage system was destroyed by the first major  in the area while it deepened and enlarged the lowland areas allowing water to settle and form a lake the glaciers were able to carve away more land on the eastern side of the lowland because the bedrock is made of shale which is softer than the carbonate rocks of  and  on the western side thus the eastern and central basins of the modern lake are much deeper than the western basin which averages only 25 feet  7.6m  deep and is rich in nutrients and fish lake erie is the shallowest of the great lakes because the ice was relatively thin and lacked erosion power when it reached that far south according to one view as many as three glaciers advanced and retreated over the land causing temporary lakes to form in the time periods in between each of them because each lake had a different volume of water their shorelines rested at differing elevations the last of these lakes to form  existed between about 13,000 and 12,000 years ago it was deeper than the current lake erie so its shoreline existed about eight miles  13km  inland from the modern one the shorelines of these lakes left behind high ground sand ridges that cut through swamps and were used as trails for indians and later pioneers these trails became primitive roads which were eventually paved  west of delphos and  west of norwalk and east of cleveland were formed in this manner one can still see some of these ancient sand dunes that formed in the  in  there the sandy dry lake bed soil was not enough to support large trees with the exception of a few species of oaks forming a rare  history
at the time of european contact there were several groups of indian cultures living around the shores of the eastern end of the lake the   from whom the lake takes its name  lived along the southern edge while the   also known as attawandaron  lived along the northern shore near port stanley there is an indian village dating from the 16th century known as the southwold earthworks where as many as 800 neutral indians once lived  the archaeological remains include double earth walls winding around the grass-covered perimeter europeans named the tribe the neutral indians since these people refused to fight with other tribes both tribes were conquered and assimilated by their hostile eastern neighbors the  between  1651 and 1657 in what is referred to as part of the  for decades after those wars the land around eastern lake erie was claimed and utilized by the iroquois as a hunting ground as the power of the iroquois waned during the last quarter of the 17th century several other mainly  native american tribes displaced them from the territories they claimed on the north shore of the lake there was a legend of an indian woman named huldah who despairing over her lost british lover hurled herself from a high rock from pelee island european exploration and settlement 




the steamship walk in water built in buffalo was the first steamship on lake erie picture circa 1816 

in 1669 the frenchman  was the first documented european to sight lake erie although there is speculation that  may have come across it in 1615 lake erie was the last of the great lakes to be explored by europeans since the iroquois who occupied the  area were in conflict with the french and they did not allow explorers or traders to pass through explorers followed rivers out of  and portaged directly into  british authorities in canada were nervous about possible expansion by american settlers across lake erie so colonel talbot developed the talbot trail in 1809 as a way to stimulate settlement to the area  talbot recruited settlers from  and  and there are numerous places named after him such as  and the  and  in southern ontario

in 1837 rebellions broke about between canadian settlers and the  primarily over political reforms and land allocation issues some of the rebels stationed themselves in the u.s and crossed the ice from sandusky bay to pelee island wearing  tattered overcoats and worn-out boots  and carrying muskets pitchforks and swords but the islanders had already fled later there was a battle on the ice with the royal 32nd regiment with the rebels being driven to retreat

settlers established commercial fisheries on the north coast of the lake around the 1850s an important business was fishing in the pre-civil war years railways sprouted everywhere and around 1852 there were railways circling the lake maritime traffic picked up although the lake was usually closed because of ice from december to early april and ships had to wait for the ice to clear before proceeding since slavery had been abolished in canada in 1833 but was still legal in southern states of the u.s a lake erie crossing was sometimes required for fugitive slaves seeking freedom 

when kentucky fugitive lewis clarke arrived in cleveland he had no idea how to find canada  i went out to the shore of the lake again and again to try and see the other side but i could see no hill mountain nor city of the asylum i sought  he once told an interviewer  i was afraid to inquire where  canada  was lest it would betray such a degree of ignorance as to excite suspicion at once  many fugitives also had to overcome fears instilled by their former masters chris lackner in the ottawa citizen 2006

merchant shippers lacked modern  and weather forecasting so vessels were often caught up in intense gales 

a violent gale is blowing on lake erie  the schooner stranger came in this morning and reports seeing a vessel about 12 miles  up 2 miles  3.2km  from the canada shore with three men clinging to the masts which alone were visible above the waterheard their cries and screams the new york times october 1853

there were reports of disasters usually from sea captains passing information to reporters  in 1868 the captain of the grace whitney saw a sunken vessel  three men clinging to the masthead  but he could not help because of the gale and high seas a  named john steiner of  made an ambitious trip across the lake in 1857 he was described in  as an eronaut or aeronaut  powered boats were called propellers  and fast was deemed railroad speed here s an account of the day-long voyage over the lake 

he arose to the height of about three miles and started off at a slow but steady rate  the lake could be seen from one end to the other nearly  at one time mr steiner counted 38 sail vessels all in sight and far below him the hands on board several of the vessels saw him and rightly apprehending that he was an aeronaut cheered him heartily  he neared the canada shore a little below long point  he was accordingly driven towards buffalo  night was drawing on and it became apparent that he could not with this current get away from the water before dark and after nightfall it would not be safe to come down seeing a propeller  the mary stewart  he first struck the water about 25 miles below long point  during this time mr steiner says he thinks his balloon bounded from the water at least twenty times it would strike and then rebound like a ball going into the air from twenty to fifty feet and still rushing down the lake at railroad speed  mr steiner then abandoned the balloon leaping into the water and swimming towards the boat which speedily reached him  july 23 1857

in 1885 lake winds were so strong that water levels dropped substantially sometimes by as much as two feet so that at ports such as toledo watercraft could not load coal or depart the port during the history of the lake as a fishery there has been marked battling by opposing interest groups here s an 1895 newspaper account in which critics of commercial fishing issued dire predictions and calling for government action to solve the problem 

the preservation of the fisheries of lake erie has become a serious problem to all who have given it close attention  the fisheries are being exhausted by the wasteful methods which are now in vogue  it is still the custom of the pound fishermen about sandusky to take fish of all sizes and if they are too small to be marketable they are turned over to a fertilizer factory if left undisturbed for two or three years more these little fish would be a very valuable product   1895





view from the  at 


predictions of the lake being over-fished in 1895 were premature since the fishery has survived commercial and sport fishing pollution in the middle of the 20th century invasive species and other ailments but state and provincial governments as well as national governments have played a greater role as time went by business boomed  in 1901 the carnegie company proposed building a new harbor near  in elk creek to accommodate shipments from its tube-plant site nearby in 1913 a memorial to commodore perry was built on put-in-bay island featuring a doric column during the  years from 1919 to 1933 a  great deal of alcohol crossed erie  along with  mobster corpses  dumped into the  which sometimes washed up on the beaches of  according to one account  hid a  fortune  in the walls of the middle island luxury club but no money was found in it as of 2007 when the building no longer stood the club had a basement casino with poker tables and slot machines during the 20th century commercial fishing was prevalent but so was the boom in manufacturing industry around the lake and often rivers and streams were used as sewers to flush untreated sewage which ended up in the lake sometimes poorly constructed sanitary systems meant that when old mains broke raw sewage would spill directly into the cuyahoga and into the lake a report in  magazine in 1969 described the lake as a  gigantic cesspool  since only three of 62 beaches were rated  completely safe for swimming  by 1975 the popular commercial fish  had been declared extinct although the declaration may have been premature by the 1980s there were about 130 fishing vessels with about 3,000 workers but commercial fishing was declining rapidly particularly from the american side great lakes compact

cold air travels over warm lake water the air becomes warmer moister less dense so that it rises  when it passes over land the reduced airspace causes the air to  pile up  resulting in  frictional convergence  this lifts the air even further to where it cools turning into droplets or snowflakes the result is enhanced snowfall 





tornadoes rarely happen around the immediate great lakes region although this one happened in 1953 in erie michigan near lake erie 





lake erie in winter


like the other great lakes erie produces  when the first cold winds of winter pass over the warm waters when the difference in temperature between the relatively warm surface water and the colder air reaches a threshold value of 18 to 23 degrees fahrenheit  10 to 13 degrees celsius  then  lake-effect snow becomes possible 

as cold air flows over the warm water the lake warms and moistens the air since warm moist air is less dense than cold air the heated air rises rising air cools and water vapor condenses into cloud droplets  the efficiency of snow production increases when the wind pushes the clouds over land friction with the ground causes air to pile up this frictional convergence creates lift and enhances snowfall bob swanson and adrienne lewis of  2008

heavy lake-effect snowfalls can occur when cold air travels 60 miles  97km  or longer over a large unfrozen lake lake-effect snow makes  and  the eleventh and thirteenth snowiest places in the entire  respectively according to data collected from the  since winds blow primarily westtoeast along the main axis of the lake lake effect snow effects are more pronounced on the eastern parts of the lake such as cities such as  and  buffalo typically gets 95 inches  240cm  of snow each winter and sometimes ten feet  3.0m  of snow  the snowiest city is  which can receive heavy snowfall from both the lake effect process and large coastal cyclones a storm around christmas in 2001 pounded buffalo with seven feet of snow 



lake erie in winter


the lake effect ends or its effect is reduced however when the lake freezes over in january 2011 for example residents of cleveland were glad when lake erie was  90 percent frozen  since it meant that the area had  made it over the hump  in terms of enduring repeated snowfalls which required much shoveling being the shallowest of the great lakes it is the most likely to freeze and frequently does on february 16 2010 meteorologists reported that the lake had frozen over marking the first time the lake had completely frozen over since the winter of 19951996 in contrast  has never completely frozen over since the warmer and deeper portion is in the south although it came close to being totally frozen during three harsh winters over the past century when the lake freezes over this usually shuts down the lake effect snowfall in past years lake ice was so thick that it was possible to drive over it or go sailing on iceboats  but in the first decade of the 21st century the ice has not been thick enough for such activities many lake residents take advantage of the ice and travel  some drive to canada and back here s one account of ice life around put-in-bay 

the first ice usually forms in late november and by january it locks into place for islanders in the western basin it is the equivalent of summer vacation  once the lake freezes islanders organize impromptu ice rallies families gather to drink hot wine and race all-terrain vehicles across the lake they also race  which resemble sailboats on skates  many people drive to other islands for dinner with friends they ride in cars with the roofs and doors chopped off so they can escape if the vehicles fall through the ice islanders stab evergreen trees into the ice every 50 yards to mark a route  even in the coldest winters there are dangerous patches of thin ice the cracks are so predictable that the put-in-bay ice yacht club prints them on a map  on a normal winter day the ice is dotted with 2,000 fishing shanties christopher maag in  2004

windy conditions 
strong winds have caused lake currents to shift sediment on the bottom leading to  wickedly shifting sandbars  which have been a source of shipwrecks but winds can have a peaceful purpose as well  there have been proposals to place electricityproducing  in windy and shallow points in the lake and along the coast both in the  and  in 2010 there were plans for  to develop five wind turbines to generate 20 megawatts of power by 2012 with plans to generate 1,000 megawatts by 2020  one proposal called for  gearless turbines  with 176-foot long blades helped along with magnets a nonprofit development group near cleveland was developing plans to construct hundreds of turbines in the lake a former steel mill site on the eastern edge of the lake in  has been redeveloped as an urban wind farm in 2007 known as  the project currently houses 14 turbines capable of generating up to 35 megawatts of electricity a plan by  to build an offshore  on the north shore of the lake from  to  for a distance of 15.5mi  24.9km  but the plan has been met with opposition from residents for a number of reasons canadians near  and  have organized protest groups to thwart attempts to bring wind turbines to the lake  reasons against the turbines include spoiling lake views as well as possible adverse effects regarding drinking water and commercial fishing plans to install turbines in pigeon bay south of  were met with opposition as well the notion that bird and bat migration may be hurt by the wind turbines has been used to argue against the wind turbines  a reporter in  wrote  given the tendency of turbines to make mincemeat of things airborne it doesnt require great imagination to figure out what would happen

according to one estimate 34 to 36 inches of water evaporates each year from the surface of the lake which allows for rainfall and other precipitation in surrounding areas there are conflicting reports about the overall effect of  on the great lakes region  including lake erie one account suggests that climate change is causing greater  of lake water leading to warmer temperatures as well as ice in winter which is less thick or nonexistent fueling concerns that  erie appears to be shrinking  and is the most likely candidate among the five great lakes to  turn into a festering mud puddle  in 2010 the  reported that the lake experienced  record-breaking temperatures  reaching 81f  27c  in mid-august and compared the lake to a  bath tub  but the long term weather patterns are subject to controversy

lake erie has a complex ecosystem with many species in constant interaction human activity such as pollution and maritime ship traffic can affect this environment in numerous ways the interactions between the new species can sometimes have beneficial effects as well as harmful effects some introductions have been seen as beneficial such as the introduction of  occasionally there have been mass die-offs of certain species of fish sometimes for reasons unknown such as many numbers of  in may 2010 invasive species 
the lake has been plagued with a number of  including  and   the  and the  one estimate was that there have been 180 invasive species in the great lakes some having traveled in ballast water in international ships zebra mussels and gobies have been credited with the increased population and size of  in lake erie in 2008 there were concerns that the  newest invader swarming in the great lakes  which was the  bloody-red shrimp  might harm fish populations and promote  environmentalists and biologists study lake conditions via installations such as the franz theodore stone laboratory on  the lab which was established in 1895 is the oldest biological field station in the united states stone laboratory was donated to the  by julius stone in 1925 as part of the university s ohio sea grant college program in addition the great lakes institute of the  has experts who study issues such as lake sediment pollution and the flow of contaminants such as  a list of the common invasive species in lake erie include  zebra mussels quagga mussels round gobies spiny european water fleas fishhook water fleas the sea lamprey and white perch the invasive plant species that fill lake erie consist mainly of eurasian milfoil and purple loosestrife eutrophication and the infamous dead zone

the green scum shown in this image taken in october 2011 is the worst  lake erie has experienced in decades 

an ongoing concern is that  nutrient overloading from fertilizers human and animal waste  known as  in which additional  and  enter the lake will cause plant life to  run wild and multiply like crazy  since there are fewer  which are like  nature s kidneys  by filtering nutrients as well as greater  channelization of waterways  nutrients in water can cause algal blooms to sprout as well as  low-oxygen dead zones  in a complex interaction of natural forces as of the 2010s much of the phosphorus in the lake comes from fertilizer applied to  soybean and corn fields but washed into streams by heavy rains the  result from growth of  a toxic  that the  which infest the lake don t eat there periodically is a dead zone or region of low oxygen in the lake whose exact location varies scientists from the  have been studying the lake s blue-green algae blooms and trying to find ways to predict when they are spreading or where they might hit landfall  typically the blooms arrive late each summer this problem was extreme in the mid and late 1960 s and the   lewms  conducted by the buffalo district of the us army  determined that the eutrophication was due to  point sources  such as industrial outfalls and municipal sanitary and storm sewer outfalls as well as  diffuse sources  such as overland runoff from farm and forest land all these sources contribute nutrients primarily  to the lake growth of organisms in the lake is then spiked to the point that oxygen levels are depleted lewms made recommendations for reducing point source outflows as well as reducing farm contributions of phosphorus by changing fertilizer usage employing   farming and other conservative practices many industrial and municipal sources have since then been greatly reduced the improved farming practices which were voluntary were followed for a while resulting in remarkable recovery of the lake in the 1970s unfortunately the conservative practices are not monitored and have not been kept up one recent account suggests that the seasonal algae blooms in lake erie were possibly caused by  runoff from cities fertilizers zebra mussels and livestock near water  a second report focuses on the zebra mussels as being the cause of  big oxygen-poor dead zones  since they filter so much sediment that they have resulted in the growth of algae one report suggests the oxygen-poor zone began about 1993 in the lake s central basin and becomes more pronounced during summer months but it is somewhat of a mystery why this happens some scientists speculate that the dead zone is a naturally occurring phenomenon another report cited ohio s  as the main source of polluted runoff of  from industries municipalities tributaries and agriculture and in 2008 satellite images showed the algal bloom heading toward pelee island and possibly heading to lake erie s central basin there have been two-year  2 million studies trying to understand the  growing zone  which was described as a  10-foot-thick layer of cold water at the bottom  55 feet  17m  in one area which stretches  100 miles across the lake s center  it kills fish and microscopic creatures of the lake s food chain and fouls the water and may cause further problems in later years for sport and commercial fishing algae blooms continued in early 2013 but new farming techniques  and even a change in lake eries ecosystem make phosphorus pollution more intractable snakes 




the northern watersnake   is nonvenomous 

the lake erie water snake a subspecies of the northern water snake   lives in the vicinity of ohio s put-in-bay harbor and had been put on the threatened species list a  is one which may soon become an  by 2010 the water snake population was over 12,000 snakes while they have a non-venomous bite they are a key predator in the lake s aquatic ecosystem since they feed on  and  and  the snake was helpful in keeping the population of  fish in check they mate from late may through early june and can be found in large mating balls with one female bunched with several males asian carp 
there is a concern that  might enter the great lakes region and alter the ecosystem negatively they have been described as  greedy giants that suck plankton from the water with the brutal efficiency of vacuum cleaners  and scientists worry that they may unravel the  aquatic food web  by crowding out other species snakehead fish 




snakehead fish


there was concern in 2007 that  fish could get into the great lakes area officials warn that if the fish invades it could  decimate the aquatic food chain  a youtube video mentioned in a newspaper account has a man claiming that the fish could  bite your entire hand off  the fish can reach 5feet 11inches  1.80m  in length and  survive out of water for four days  and  has a mouth full of teeth that can shear fish in half  and can  eat ducks and small mammals  it should be noted however the snakehead fish can not live in a lake that has completely frozen over they must come to the surface to breathe via their swim bladder 
it gets such huge sizes it moves over land and it breathes air and it will eat anything it comes into contact with that s what freaks people out about it to see a fish moving across land gulping air about the snakehead fish 2007 canwest news service

agriculture and life around the lake 
in 1999 doppler radar weather sensors detected millions of mayflies heading for presque isle in blue and green splotches on the radar in clouds measuring ten miles  16km  long these insects were a sign of lake erie s move back to health since the mayflies require clean water to thrive biologist masteller of  declared the bugs to be a  nice nuisance  since they signified the lake s return to health after forty years of absence each is an inch and a half long  the three main species of mayflies are ephemera simulans hexagenia rigida and hexagenia limbata the insects mate over a 72-hour period from june through september  they fly in masses up to the shore mate in the air then females lay up to 8,000 eggs each over the water  the eggs sink back down and the cycle repeats sometimes the clouds of mayflies have caused power outages as well as causing roads to become slippery with squashed insects since  filter extra nutrients from the lake it allows the mayfly larvae to thrive

summer morning west of 


lake erie is home to one of the world s largest freshwater commercial fisheries lake erie s fish populations are the most abundant of the great lakes partially because of the lake s relatively mild temperatures and plentiful supply of  which is the basic building block of the  the lake s fish population accounts for an estimated 50 of all fish inhabiting the great lakes the lake is  loaded with superstars  such as    american usage  or   canadian usage    as well as bass trout salmon whitefesh smelt and many others the lake consists of a long list of well established  common non-indigenous fish species include the    and  non-native sport fish such as  and  are stocked specifically for anglers to catch attempts failed to stock  and its numbers are once again dwindling commercial landings are dominated by yellow perch and  with substantial quantities of  and  also taken anglers target walleye and yellow perch with some effort directed at  a variety of other species are taken in smaller quantities by both commercial and sport fleets up until the end of the 1950s the most commonly caught commercial fish  more than 50 of the commercial catch  was a subspecies of the walleye known as the   sander vitreus glaucus  sometimes erroneously called  blue pike  in the 1970s and 1980s as pollution in the lake declined counts of walleyes which were caught grew from 112,000 in 1975 to 4.1 million in 1985 with estimates of the numbers of walleyes in the lake at around 33 million in the basin with many of 8 pounds or more not all walleyes thrived the combination of overfishing and the eutrophication of the lake by pollution caused the population to collapse and in the mid-1980s one species of walleye called the  was declared extinct but the lake erie walleye was reportedly having record numbers even in 1989 according to one report there have been concerns about rising levels of mercury in walleye fish  a study by the canadian ministry of the environment noted an  increasing concentration trend  but that limits were within acceptable established by authorities in  it was recommended because of pcbs that persons eat no more than one walleye meal per month because of these and other concerns in 1990 the national wildlife federation was on the verge of having a  negative fish consumption advisory  for walleyes and smallmouth bass which had been the bread-and-butter catch of an  800 million commercial fishing industry the longest fish in lake erie is reportedly the  which can grow to ten feet long and weight 300 pounds but it is an  and mostly lives on the bottom of the lake in 2009 there was a confirmed instance of a sturgeon being caught which was returned to the lake alive and there are hopes that the population of sturgeons is resurging commercial fishing 




sunset on lake erie seen through a fishing net


estimates vary about the fishing market for the great lakes region one estimate of the total market for fishing including commercial as well as sport or recreational fishing for all of the great lakes was  4 billion annually in 2007 a second estimate was that the fishing industry was valued at more than  7 billion but since high levels of  were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s there has been continued debate over the desired intensity of commercial fishing  in lake erie has been hurt by the bad economy as well as government regulations which limit the size of their catch  one report suggested that the numbers of fishing boats and employees had declined by two-thirds in recent decades another concern had been that pollution in the lake as well as toxins found inside fish were working against commercial fishing interests u.s fishermen based along lake erie  lost their livelihood  over the past few decades described as being  caught in a net of laws and bans  according to the  and no longer catch fish such as  for markets in new york pennsylvania had a special  3 stamp on fishing licenses to help  compensate commercial fishermen for their losses  but this program ended after five years turning erie s commercial fishing industry into an  artifact  one blamed the commercial fishing ban after a  test of wills  between commercial and recreational fishermen   one side needed large hauls the other feared the lake was being emptied 
commercial fishing is now predominantly based in canadian communities with a much smaller fisherylargely restricted to in ohio one account suggested that canadian fishermen are  still at it and making money  and they  know how to fish  by  using the old nets  the ontario fishery is one of the most intensively managed in the world however there are reports that some canadian commercial fishermen are dissatisfied with fishing quotas and have sued their government about this matter and there have been complaints that the legislative body writing the quotas is  dominated by the u.s  and that sport fishing interests are favored at the expense of commercial fishing interests cuts of 30 to 45 percent for certain fish were made in 2007 the lake erie fishery was one of the first fisheries in the world managed on individual transferable quotas and features mandatory daily catch reporting and intensive auditing of the catch reporting system still the commercial fishery is the target of critics who would like to see the lake managed for the exclusive benefit of  and the various industries serving the sport fishery in november 2010 ontario s oldest and largest fish processor known as great lakes fish corporation was shut down after operating for a hundred years  130 workers were laid off and numerous spinoff jobs disappeared such as jobs at local restaurants and net repair shops according to one report the canadian town of  is the home of the lake s largest fishing fleet and the town features miniature golf dairy bars french-fry stands and restaurants serving  government regulation of fishing 
the lake can be thought of as a common asset with multiple purposes including being a fishery there was direct competition between commercial fishermen and sport fishermen  including charter boats and sales of fishing licenses  throughout the lake s history with both sides seeking government assistance from either  or  and trying to make their case in the  court  of  through newspaper reporting but other groups have entered the political process as well including  lakefront property owners industry owners and workers seeking cost-effective solutions for sewage ferry boat operators even corporations making electric-generating wind turbines management of the fishery is by consensus of all management agencies with an interest in the resource and include the states of     and the province of  and work under the mandate of the  the commission makes assessments using sophisticated  systems the commission has been the focus of considerable recrimination primarily from angler and charter fishing groups in the u.s which have had a historical antipathy to commercial fishing interests this conflict is complex dating from the 1960s and earlier with the result in the united states that in 2011 commercial fishing was mostly eliminated from great lakes states one report suggests that battling between diverse fishing interests began around  and evolved to cover the entire great lakes region the analysis suggests that in the lake erie context the competition between sport and commercial fishing involves universals and that these conflicts are cultural not scientific and therefore not resolvable by reference to ecological data sport fishing 
the lake also supports a strong sport fishery while commercial fishing declined sport fishing has remained the deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing is in the canadian side of the lake as a result a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport if their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake upon returning to the american shore passengers will have to  drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures  to customs officers by videophone there are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well who will have to fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving  officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft  authorities in 2008 from the pennsylvania fish and boat commission have tried stocking the lake with  in an effort to build what s called a put-grow-and-take fishery there was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the american side from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in ohio alone during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake in 1984 ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits and sport fishing was described as big business in 1992 there were accounts of fishermen catching 8 10 and 12 pound walleyes and that the  runt of a five-man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds  it is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the  also known by pseudonyms such as eelpout mudblow lawyer fish cusk or freshwater cod which looks  ugly  but tastes great  the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of  erie s glacial relics

ice fishing 
in winter when the lake freezes many fishermen go out on the ice cut holes and fish it is even possible to build bonfires on the ice but venturing on lake erie ice can be dangerous in a freak incident in 2009 warming temperatures and winds of 35 miles per hour and currents pushing eastward dislodged a miles-wide ice floe which broke away from the shore trapping more than 130 fishermen offshore  one man died while the rest were rescued by helicopters or boats 
the day began with fishermen setting down wooden pallets to create a bridge over a crack in the ice so they could roam farther out on the lake but the planks fell into the water when the ice shifted stranding the fishermen about 1,000 yards offshore  when fishermen realized late saturday morning that the ice had broken away they began to debate the best way off some chose to sit and wait for authorities while others headed east in search of an ice bridge  others managed to get to land on their own by riding their all-terrain vehicles about five miles east to where ice hadn t broken away  when the rescued fishermen made it to shore authorities had them line up single-file to take down their names john seewer february 2009

lake erie is a favorite for divers since there are many shipwrecks perhaps 1,400 to 8,000 according to one estimate of which about 270 are  confirmed shipwreck locations  most wrecks are undiscovered but believed to be well preserved and in good condition and at most only 200 feet  61m  below the water surface one report suggests there are more  wrecks per square mile  than any other freshwater location including wrecks from  watercraft there are efforts to identify shipwreck sites and survey the lake floor to map the location of underwater sites possibly for further study or exploration while the lake is relatively warmer than the other great lakes there is a thermocline meaning that as a diver descends the water temperature drops about 30 degrees fahrenheit change  17c  requiring a wetsuit one estimate is that lake erie has a quarter of all 8,000 estimated shipwrecks in the great lakes they are preserved because the water is cold and salt-free creating  intact time capsules down there  divers have a policy of not removing or touching anything at the wreck else the  next person won t be able to see it  when artifacts were removed on occasion it was met by  outrage  by the diving community the cold conditions make diving difficult and  strenuous  requiring divers with skill and experience one charter firm from western new york state takes about 1,500 divers to lake erie shipwrecks in a typical season from april through october

the anthony wayne side-wheel passenger and cargo steamship sank in 1850 but was rediscovered in 2006 by diver tom kowalczk about six miles  9.7km  north of vermilion ohio it is believed to be the oldest archaeological steamship wreck in lake erie according to the great lakes historical society 

in 1991 the 19th-century sidewheeler atlantic was discovered it had sunk in a collision with the ogdensburg a steamship sometimes referred to as a  propeller  according to 19th-century parlance in 1852 six miles  9.7km  west of  and survivors from the atlantic were saved by the ogdensburg one account suggests 130 people drowned while another suggests about 20 drowned the aftermath of the disaster led to calls for authorities to seize captains of both ships so  that the cause of the collision may be correctly ascertained  as well as calls for more lifeboats and improved life preservers since the earlier ones proved to be  totally useless  there was speculation that the sunken vessel had been a gambling ship and therefore there might have been money aboard but most historians were skeptical in 1998 the shipwreck of the vessel adventure was the first shipwreck registered with the state of ohio as an  underwater archaeological site  when it was discovered that the adventure s propeller had been removed and given to a junkyard the propeller was rescued days before being converted to scrap metal and brought back to the dive site and back to its underwater home in 2003 divers discovered the steamer canobie near presque isle which sunk in 1921 other wrecks include the fish tub neal h dow  1910  the elderado  steamer-cum-barge   1880  the w r hanna the dundee which sank north of cleveland in 1900 the f h prince and the craftsman in 2007 the wreck of the steamship named after mad anthony wayne was found near  in 50 feet  15m  of water  the vessel sank in 1850 after its boilers exploded and 38 people died the wreck belongs to the state of ohio and  salvaging it is illegal  but divers can visit it after it is surveyed in addition there are wrecks of smaller vessels with occasional drownings of fishermen the finding of the well-preserved wreck of the canadian-built british troop transport warship caledonia sunk during the war of 1812 has led to accusations about plundering of the site and legal wrangling about whether the vessel should be resurfaced in time for the 2013 war s bicentennial research into shipwrecks has been organized by the peachman lake erie shipwreck research center or plesrc located on the grounds of the great lakes historical society in 2008 the great lakes historical society announced plans to survey the underwater battle site of the  in preparation for the bicentennial celebration of the battle in 2013 public parks
