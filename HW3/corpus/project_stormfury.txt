project stormfury was an attempt to weaken  by flying aircraft into them and  with  the project was run by the  from 1962 to 1983 the hypothesis was that the silver iodide would cause   in the storm to freeze disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane this led to the seeding of several atlantic hurricanes however it was later shown that this hypothesis was incorrect it was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective additionally researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same  that were expected from seeded hurricanes this finding called stormfury s successes into question as the changes reported now had a natural explanation the last experimental flight was flown in 1971 due to a lack of candidate storms and a changeover in  s fleet more than a decade after the last modification experiment project stormfury was officially canceled although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes project stormfury was not without merit the observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by stormfury helped improve meteorologists  ability to  the movement and intensity of future hurricanes

hypothesis 




the working hypothesis of project stormfury


cloud seeding was first attempted by  and  after witnessing the artificial creation of ice crystals langmuir became an enthusiastic proponent of  schaefer found that when he dumped crushed  into a cloud precipitation in the form of  resulted with regard to hurricanes it was hypothesized that by seeding the area around the  with   would be released this would promote the formation of a new eyewall as this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced  even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane s winds would be beneficial  since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness due to langmuir s efforts and the research of schaefer at  the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum indeed schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on december 20 1946 by seeding a cloud this caused ge to drop out for legal reasons schaefer and langmuir assisted the u.s military as advisors for project cirrus the first large study of  and  its most important goal was to try to weaken  project cirrus 
project cirrus was the first attempt to modify a hurricane it was a collaboration of the  corporation the  the  and the  after several preparations and initial skepticism by government scientists the first attempt to modify a hurricane began on october 13 1947 on a  that was heading  and out to sea an airplane flew along the rainbands of the hurricane and dropped nearly 180 pounds  82 kilograms  of crushed  into the clouds the crew reported  pronounced modification of the cloud deck seeded  it is not known if that was due to the seeding next the hurricane changed direction and made landfall near  the public blamed the seeding and  claimed that the reversal had been caused by human intervention cirrus was canceled and  were threatened only the fact that  had taken a similar path as well as evidence showing that the storm had already begun to turn when seeding began ended the  this disaster set back the cause of seeding hurricanes for eleven years at first the seeding was officially denied and it took years before the government admitted it according to the sept 12 1965 edition of the fort lauderdale news and sun-sentinel in 1947 a hurricane  went whacky  and  twelve years later it was admitted the storm had in fact been seeded

the  s  founded in 1955 had as one of its objectives to investigate the scientific validity of hurricane modification methods to this end silver iodide dispensers were tested in  in august 1958 the flares were deployed outside of the hurricane eyewall so this was an equipment test rather than a modification experiment the equipment malfunctioned in all but one of the flights and no conclusive data was acquired the first seeding experiment since the cirrus disaster was attempted on september 16 1961 into  by nhrp and the  aircraft eight cylinders of silver iodide were dropped into esther s eyewall and winds were recorded as weakening by 10 percent the next day more seeding flights were made this time the silver iodide did not fall into the eyewall and no reduction in windspeed was observed these two results were interpreted as making the experiment a  success  the seedings into hurricane esther led to the establishment of project stormfury in 1962 project stormfury was a joint venture of the  and the  project baton 
the objective of project baton was the analysis of the life history of thunderstorms a department of defense research activity supported by the advanced research project agency project baton sought to expand understanding of storm physics as an aid to weather forecasting fire prevention and possibly for artificially controlling the weather dr helmut weickmann as an employee of the u.s army signal research and development laboratory and dr paul mcready of meteorology research inc were joint leaders of the project baton team during the 1962 julyaugust storm season in flagstaff arizona the scientists selected  guinea pig  storms and seeded them with chemicals effects were thoroughly analyzed from the ground and from the air with time-lapse motion picture cameras stereo still cameras storm radar lightning detectors and airborne heat sensors among the agents inserted in selected clouds were  condensation nuclei  which temporarily increased the number of water droplets in the cloud and pulverized dry ice which turns a portion of the cloud to fine snow crystals that remain aloft the utilization of these agents facilitated study of a storm s characteristics project stormfury begins 
 became its first director serving in this capacity until 1965 there were several guidelines used in selecting which storms to seed the hurricane had to have a less than 10 percent chance of approaching inhabited land within a day  it had to be within range of the seeding aircraft  and it had to be a fairly intense storm with a well-formed  the primary effect of these criteria was to make possible seeding targets extremely rare no suitable storms formed in the  next year stormfury began by conducting  on  from august 17 to 20 of that year experiments were conducted in 11 clouds of which six were seeded and five were  in five of the six seeded clouds changes consistent with the working hypothesis were observed on august 23 1963  was the site of the next seeding attempt it had an indistinct eyewall in addition mistakes were made as the seedings of silver iodide were dropped in the wrong places as a consequence nothing happened the next day another attempt was made and the seeders hit their targets the eyewall was observed to fall apart and be replaced by another eyewall with a larger radius the  also fell by twenty percent all in all the results of the experiments on beulah were  encouraging but inconclusive 
in the six years after beulah no seedings were conducted for several different reasons in 1964 measurement and observation equipment was not ready to be used the year after that all flights were used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane clouds  became its director beginning in 1965 while out to sea in august of the  stormfury meteorologists decided that  was a good candidate for seeding however the storm immediately swung towards land and on september 1 the planned flights were canceled for some reason the press was not notified that there were no seedings and several newspapers reported that it had begun as betsy passed close to  and smashed into southern  the public and  thought that seeding was underway and blamed stormfury it took two months for stormfury officials to convince congress that betsy was not seeded and the project was allowed to continue a second candidate  stayed too far out to sea after betsy two other hurricanes came close to being seeded  was considered a likely candidate but it stayed out of range of the seeding planes that same year recon flights were conducted into  but there were no seedings both the  and  were inactive because of that there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons

dr r cecil gentry became the director of stormfury in 1968 there were no more near-seedings until 1969 in the interim equipment was improved what once was the primitive method of hand-dumping dry ice was replaced with rocket canisters loaded with silver iodide and then gun-like devices mounted on the wings of the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds observation equipment was improved additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the working hypothesis the new theory took cumulus towers outside the  into account according to the revised theory by seeding the towers  would be released this would trigger the start of new convection which would then cause a new eyewall since the new eyewall was outside the original one the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart in addition since the new eyewall was broader than the old one the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure difference  in 1969 provided the best opportunity to test the underpinnings of project stormfury in many ways it was the perfect storm for seeding  it did not threaten any land  it passed within range of seeding aircraft  and was intense with a distinct eye on august 18 and again on august 20 thirteen planes flew out to the storm to monitor and seed it on the first day windspeeds fell by 31 on the second day windspeeds fell by 18 both changes were consistent with stormfury s working hypothesis indeed the results were so encouraging that  a greatly expanded research program was planned  among other conclusions was the need for frequent seeding at close to hourly intervals the  and  provided no suitable seeding candidates despite this flights were conducted into  ginger was not a suitable storm for seeding due to its diffuse indistinct nature the seeding had no effect ginger was the last seeding done by project stormfury after the seedings

atlantic hurricanes meeting all of the criteria were extremely rare which made duplication of the  success  reached with hurricane debbie extremely difficult meanwhile developments outside of meteorology hindered the cause of hurricane modification in the early 1970s the navy withdrew from the project stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding rather than modifying tropical cyclones at the same time the project s aircraft were nearing the end of their operational lifetimes at the cost of  30million  year unknown  two  s were acquired due to the rarity of atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements plans were made to move stormfury to the pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons there this action required many of the same safety requirements as in the atlantic but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects the plan was to begin again in 1976 and seed typhoons by flying out of  however political issues blocked the plan the  announced that it would not be happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores while  declared itself willing to put up with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones similar plans to operate stormfury in the eastern north pacific or in the  region also collapsed failure of the working hypothesis 
multiple eyewalls had been detected in very strong hurricanes before including  and  although the double eyes were usually seen in very intense systems double eyewalls were also seen post-seeding in some of the seeded storms at the time however the only known times that rapid changes in eyewall diameter other than during presumably successful seedings was during rapid changes in intensity it remained controversial whether the seedings caused the secondary eyewalls or whether it was just a natural cycle basically if eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded hurricanes were rare in unseeded tropical cyclones it would provide powerful evidence that project stormfury was successful conversely if such changes were common in unseeded systems it would throw doubt on the very hypothesis and assumptions driving project stormfury data and observations began to accumulate that debunked stormfury s working hypothesis beginning with hurricanes  and  flights by  aircraft encountered events similar to what happened in  successfully  seeded storms anita itself had a weak example of a concentric eyewall cycle and david a more dramatic one in august 1980 hurricane allen passed through the   and  it also underwent changes in the diameter of its eye and developed multiple eyewalls all this was consistent with the behavior that would have been expected of allen had it been seeded thus what stormfury was accomplishing by seeding was also happening on its own other observations in hurricanes anita david  and allen also discovered that tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water and a great deal of ice crystals the reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the  within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing as cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect those observations called the basis for project stormfury into question in the middle of 1983 stormfury was finally canceled after the hypothesis guiding its efforts was invalidated legacy 
in the sense of weakening hurricanes to reduce their destructiveness project stormfury was a complete failure because it did not distinguish between natural phenomena in tropical cyclones and the impact of human intervention millions of dollars had been spent trying to do the impossible in the end   stormfury had two fatal flaws  it was neither microphysically nor statistically feasible 
in addition stormfury had been a primary generator of funding for the  while the project was operational the hrd s budget had been around  4million  1975    16million 2008usd  with a staff of approximately 100people today the hrd employs 30people and has a budget of roughly  2.6million each year however project stormfury had positive results as well knowledge gained during flights proved invaluable in debunking its hypotheses other science resulted in a greater understanding of tropical cyclones in addition the  were perfectly suitable for gathering data on tropical cyclones allowing improved forecasting of these monstrous storms those planes are still used by the noaa today former  president  alleged that project stormfury was an attempt to weaponize hurricanes see also
