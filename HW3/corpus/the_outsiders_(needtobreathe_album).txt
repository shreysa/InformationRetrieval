critical reception 

the outsiders garnered critical acclaim from  at  andrew leahey rated the album four stars and suggested that the band  offer up another collection of sweeping reverent rock songs  on which he alluded to how the album  flirts with touches of roots rock and traditional gospel though from the title track s powerful southern stomp to the sheer power of bear rinehart s voice  furthermore leahey noted the album  covers more ground than records by similar artists and it does so without alienating any of its secular-minded listeners too  matt conner of  indicated in a positive review that the album  brings even more evidence to the table that rinehart s rock sensibilities only improve with time  and conner also mentioned that the album s  second half provides some of the most beautiful moments on the record
