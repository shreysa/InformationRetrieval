microsoft powerpoint is a  created by robert gaskins and dennis austin at a software company named forethought inc it was released on april 20 1987 initially for macintosh computers only microsoft acquired powerpoint for  14million three months after it appeared this was microsoft s first significant acquisition and microsoft set up a new business unit for powerpoint in silicon valley where forethought had been located powerpoint became a component of the microsoft office suite first offered in 1989 for macintosh and in 1990 for windows which bundled several microsoft apps beginning with powerpoint 4.0  1994  powerpoint was integrated into microsoft office development and adopted shared common components and a converged user interface powerpoint s market share was very small at first prior to introducing a version for microsoft windows but grew rapidly with the growth of windows and of office pp402404  since the late 1990s powerpoint s worldwide market share of presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent powerpoint was originally designed to provide visuals for group presentations within business organizations but has come to be very widely used in many other communication situations both in business and beyond the impact of this much wider use of powerpoint has been experienced as a powerful change throughout society with strong reactions including advice that it should be used less should be used differently or should be used better the first powerpoint version  macintosh 1987  was used to produce overhead transparencies the second  macintosh 1988 windows 1990  could also produce color 35mm slides the third version  windows and macintosh 1992  introduced video output of virtual slideshows to digital projectors which would over time completely replace physical transparencies and slides a dozen major versions since then have added many additional features and modes of operation and have made powerpoint available beyond apple macintosh and microsoft windows adding versions for ios android and web access

history 
creation at forethought  19841987 
powerpoint was created by  and dennis austin at a software  in  named  forethought had been founded in 1983 to create an integrated environment and applications for future personal computers that would provide a graphical user interface but it had run into difficulties requiring a  restart  and new plan on july 5 1984 forethought hired robert gaskins as its vice president of product development p51  to create a new application that would be especially suited to the new  personal computers such as  and  gaskins produced his initial description of powerpoint about a month later  august 14 1984  in the form of a 2-page document titled  presentation graphics for overhead projection  by october 1984 gaskins had selected dennis austin to be the developer for powerpoint gaskins and austin worked together on the definition and design of the new product for nearly a year and produced the first specification document dated august 21 1985 this first design document showed a product as it would look in microsoft  which at that time had not been released development from that spec was begun by austin in november 1985 for macintosh first p104  about six months later on may 1 1986 gaskins and austin chose a second developer to join the project thomas rudkin p149  gaskins prepared two final product specification marketing documents in june 1986  these described a product for both macintosh and windows at about the same time austin rudkin and gaskins produced a second and final major design specification document this time showing a macintosh look throughout this development period the product was called  presenter  then just before release there was a last-minute check with forethought s lawyers to register the name as a trademark and  presenter  was unexpectedly rejected because it had already been used by someone else gaskins says that he thought of  powerpoint  based on the product s goal of  empowering  individual presenters and sent that name to the lawyers for clearance while all the documentation was hastily revised funding to complete development of powerpoint was assured in mid-january 1987 when a new apple computer venture capital fund called apple s strategic investment group selected powerpoint to be its first investment pp169171  a month later on february 22 1987 forethought announced powerpoint at the personal computer forum in phoenix   the ceo of apple appeared at the announcement and said  we see desktop presentation as potentially a bigger market for apple than desktop publishing 
powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh shipped from manufacturing on april 20 1987 and the first production run of 10,000 units was sold out acquisition by microsoft  19871992 
by early 1987 microsoft was starting to plan a new application to create presentations an activity led by  who was head of marketing for the applications division microsoft assigned an internal group to write a specification and plan for a new presentation product they contemplated an acquisition to speed up development and in early 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire  s product called  an outlining program that could print its outlines as bullet charts during this preparatory activity raikes discovered that a program specifically to make overhead presentations was already being developed by forethought inc and that it was nearly completed raikes and others visited forethought on february 6 1987 for a confidential demonstration p173 
raikes later recounted his reaction to seeing powerpoint and his report about it to  who was initially skeptical 

i thought  software to do overheadsthat s a great idea  i came back to see bill i said  bill i think we really ought to do this  and bill said  no no no no no that s just a feature of microsoft word just put it into word   and i kept saying  bill no it s not just a feature of microsoft word it s a whole genre of how people do these presentations  and to his credit he listened to me and ultimately allowed me to go forward and  buy this company in silicon valley called forethought for the product known as powerpoint 
when powerpoint was released by forethought its initial press was favorable  the wall street journal reported on early reactions   i see about one product a year i get this excited about  says amy wohl a consultant in bala cynwyd pa  people will buy a macintosh just to get access to this product 
on april 28 1987 a week after shipment a group of microsoft s senior executives spent another day at forethought to hear about initial powerpoint sales on macintosh and plans for windows p191  the following day microsoft sent a letter to dave winer withdrawing its earlier letter of intent to acquire his company and in mid-may 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire forethought as requested in that letter of intent robert gaskins from forethought went to redmond for a one-on-one meeting with bill gates in early june 1987 p197  and by the end of july an agreement was concluded for an acquisition the new york times reported 

 july 30 the microsoft corporation announced its first significant software acquisition today paying  14million  29.5million in present-day terms  for forethought inc of sunnyvale calif forethought makes a program called powerpoint that allows users of apple macintosh computers to make overhead transparencies or flip charts  he acquisition of forethought is the first significant one for microsoft which is based in redmond wash forethought would remain in sunnyvale giving microsoft a silicon valley presence the unit will be headed by robert gaskins forethought s vice president of product development 
microsoft s president  offered microsoft s motivation for the acquisition   we made this deal primarily because of our belief in desktop presentations as a product category  forethought was first to market with a product in this category 
microsoft set up within its applications division an independent  graphics business unit  to develop and to market powerpoint the first microsoft application group distant from the main redmond location all the powerpoint people from forethought joined microsoft and the new location was headed by robert gaskins with dennis austin and thomas rudkin leading development powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh was modified to indicate the new microsoft ownership and continued to be sold a new powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh adding color 35mm slides appeared by mid-1988 and again won good reviews the same powerpoint 2.0 product re-developed for windows was shipped two years later in mid-1990 at the same time as  much of the color technology was the fruit of a joint development partnership with  at that time the dominant presentation services company powerpoint 3.0 which was shipped in 1992 for both windows and mac added live video for projectors and monitors with the result that powerpoint was thereafter used for delivering presentations as well as for preparing them this was at first an alternative to overhead transparencies and 35mm slides but over time would come to replace them part of microsoft office  since 1993

powerpoint had been included in  from the beginning powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh was part of the first office bundle for macintosh which was offered in mid-1989 when powerpoint 2.0 for windows appeared a year later it was part of a similar office bundle for windows which was offered in late 1990 both of these were bundling promotions in which the independent applications were packaged together and offered for a lower total price powerpoint 3.0  1992  was again separately specified and developed and was prominently advertised and sold separately from office it was as before included in  both for windows and the corresponding version for macintosh a plan to integrate the applications themselves more tightly had been indicated as early as february 1991 toward the end of powerpoint 3.0 development in an internal memo by bill gates 

another important question is what portion of our applications sales over time will be a set of applications versus a single product  please assume that we stay ahead in integrating our family together in evaluating our future strategiesthe product teams will deliver on this  i believe that we should position the  office  as our most important application 
the move from bundling separate products to integrated development began with powerpoint 4.0 developed in 19931994 under new management from redmond the powerpoint group in silicon valley was reorganized from the independent  graphics business unit   gbu  to become the  graphics product unit   gpu  for office and powerpoint 4.0 changed to adopt a converged user interface and other components shared with the other apps in office when it was released the computer press reported on the change approvingly   powerpoint 4.0 has been re-engineered from the ground up to resemble and work with the latest applications in office  word 6.0 excel 5.0 and access 2.0 the integration is so good you ll have to look twice to make sure you re running powerpoint and not word or excel  office integration was further underscored in the following version powerpoint 95 which was given the version number powerpoint 7.0  skipping 5.0 and 6.0  so that all the components of office would share the same major version number although powerpoint by this point had become part of the integrated microsoft office product its development remained in silicon valley succeeding versions of powerpoint introduced important changes particularly version 12.0  2007  which had a very different shared office   user interface and a new shared  this marked the 20th anniversary of powerpoint and microsoft held an event to commemorate that anniversary at its silicon valley campus for the powerpoint team there special guests were robert gaskins dennis austin and thomas rudkin and the featured speaker was jeff raikes all from powerpoint 1.0 days 20 years before since then major development of powerpoint as part of office has continued new development techniques  shared across office  for powerpoint 2016 have made it possible to ship versions of powerpoint 2016 for windows mac ios android and web access nearly simultaneously and to release new features on a nearly-monthly schedule powerpoint development is still located in silicon valley as of 2017 in 2010 jeff raikes who had most recently been president of the business division of microsoft  including responsibility for office  observed   of course today we know that powerpoint is often times the number twoor in some cases even the number onemost-used tool  among the applications in office sales and market share 
powerpoint s initial sales were about 40,000 copies sold in 1987  nine months  about 85,000 copies in 1988 and about 100,000 copies in 1989 all for macintosh powerpoint s market share in its first three years was a tiny part of the total presentation market which was very heavily dominated by  applications on pcs the market leaders on ms-dos in 1988-1989 were   introduced by  in 1986  in first place and   also introduced in 1986  as a strong second they were competing with more than a dozen other ms-dos presentation products and microsoft did not develop a powerpoint version for ms-dos after three years powerpoint sales were disappointing jeff raikes who had bought powerpoint for microsoft later recalled   by 1990 it looked like it wasn t a very smart idea  because not very many people were using powerpoint 
this began to change when the first version for windows powerpoint 2.0 brought sales up to about 200,000 copies in 1990 and to about 375,000 copies in 1991 with windows units outselling macintosh p403  powerpoint sold about 1million copies in 1992 of which about 80 percent were for windows and about 20 percent for macintosh p403  and in 1992 powerpoint s market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 63 percent p404  by the last six months of 1992 powerpoint revenue was running at a rate of over  100million annually  211million in present-day terms  p405 
sales of powerpoint 3.0 doubled to about 2million copies in 1993 of which about 90 percent were for windows and about 10 percent for macintosh p403  and in 1993 powerpoint s market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 78 percent p404  in both years about half of total revenue came from sales outside the u.s p404 
by 1997 powerpoint sales had doubled again to more than 4million copies annually representing 85 percent of the world market also in 1997 an internal publication from the powerpoint group said that by then over 20million copies of powerpoint were in use and that total revenues from powerpoint over its first ten years  1987 to 1996  had already exceeded  1billion since the late 1990s powerpoint s market share of total world presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent by both industry and academic sources operation 
the earliest version of powerpoint  1987 for macintosh  could be used to print black and white pages to be photocopied onto  for projection from  and to print speaker s notes and audience handouts  the next version  1988 for macintosh 1990 for windows  was extended to also produce  by communicating a file over a modem to a  imaging center with slides returned by overnight delivery for projection from  powerpoint was used for planning and preparing a presentation but not for delivering it  apart from previewing it on a computer screen or distributing printed paper copies  the operation of powerpoint changed substantially in its third version  1992 for windows and macintosh  when powerpoint was extended to also deliver a presentation by producing direct video output to  or large monitors in 1992 video projection of presentations was rare and expensive and practically unknown from a laptop computer robert gaskins one of the creators of powerpoint says he publicly demonstrated that use for the first time at a large microsoft meeting held in paris on february 25 1992 by using an unreleased development build of powerpoint 3.0 running on an early pre-production sample of a powerful new color laptop and feeding a  pp373375 
by about 2003 ten years later digital projection had become the dominant mode of use replacing transparencies and 35mm slides and their projectors pp410414  as a result the meaning of  powerpoint presentation  narrowed to mean specifically digital projection 

 in the business lexicon  powerpoint presentation  had come to refer to a presentation made using a powerpoint slideshow projected from a computer although the powerpoint software had been used to generate transparencies for over a decade this usage was not typically encompassed by common understanding of the term 
in contemporary operation powerpoint is used to create a file  called a  presentation  or  deck  containing a sequence of pages  called  slides  in the app  which usually have a consistent style  from template masters  and which may contain information imported from other apps or created in powerpoint including text bullet lists tables charts drawn shapes images audio clips video clips animations of elements and animated transitions between slides plus attached notes for each slide after such a file is created typical operation is to present it as a  using a portable computer where the presentation file is stored on the computer or available from a network and the computer s screen shows a  presenter view  with current slide next slide speaker s notes for the current slide and other information video is sent from the computer to one or more external digital projectors or monitors showing only the current slide to the audience with sequencing controlled by the speaker at the computer a smartphone remote control built in to powerpoint for ios  optionally controlled from apple watch  and for android allows the presenter to control the show from elsewhere in the room in addition to a computer slide show projected to a live audience by a speaker powerpoint can be used to deliver a presentation in a number of other ways 

displayed on the screen of the presentation computer or tablet  for a very small group 
printed for distribution as paper documents  in several formats 
distributed as files for private viewing even on computers without powerpoint
packaged for distribution on cd or a network including linked and embedded data
transmitted as a live broadcast presentation over the web
embeded in a web page or blog
shared on social networks such as  or 
set up as a self-running unattended display
recorded as video audio   to be distributed as for any other video

some of these ways of using powerpoint have been studied by  and  of the  

the standard form of such presentations involves a single person standing before a group of people talking and using the powerpoint slideshow to project visual aids onto a screen  in practice however presentations are not always delivered in this mode in our studies we often found that the presenter sat at a table with a small group of people and walked them through a  deck  composed of paper copies of the slides in some cases decks were simply distributed to individuals without even a walk-through or discussion  other variations in form included sending the powerpoint file electronically to another site and talking through the slides over an audio or video channel  e.g telephone or video conference  as both parties viewed the slides  another common variation was placing a powerpoint file on a web site for people to view at different times 
they found that some of these ways of using powerpoint could influence the content of presentations for example when  the slides themselves have to carry more of the substance of the presentation and thus need considerably more content than they would have if they were intended for projection by a speaker who would orally provide additional details and nuance about content and context 
cultural impact 




a powerpoint presentation in progress


powerpoint more than most other personal computer applications has been experienced as a powerful force producing change throughout all of society in 2016 an analyst summed up   the real mystery is   how come almost every organisation in the world is using powerpoint to communicate almost everything to almost everybody  that s the real question how come powerpoint is everywhere 
business uses 
powerpoint was originally targeted just for business presentations robert gaskins who was responsible for its design has written about his intended customers    i did not target other existing large groups of users of presentations such as school teachers or military officers  i also did not plan to target people who were not existing users of presentations  such as clergy and school children   our focus was purely on business users in small and large companies from one person to the largest multinationals pp7677  business people had for a long time made presentations for sales calls and for internal company communications and powerpoint produced the same formats in the same style and for the same purposes p420 
powerpoint use in business grew over its first five years  1987-1992  to sales of about 1 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 63 percent over the following five years  1992-1997  powerpoint sales accelerated to a rate of about 4 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 85 percent the increase in business use has been attributed to    whereby additional users of powerpoint in a company or an industry increased its salience and value to other users not everyone immediately approved of the greater use of powerpoint for presentations even in business ceos who very early were reported to discourage or ban powerpoint presentations at internal business meetings included   at ibm in 1993    at sun microsystems in 1996  and   at apple in 1997  but even so rich gold a scholar who studied corporate presentation use at  could write in 1999   within today s corporation if you want to communicate an idea  you use powerpoint 
uses beyond business 
at the same time that powerpoint was becoming dominant in business settings it was also being adopted for uses beyond business   personal computing  scaled up the production of presentations  the result has been the rise of presentation culture in an information society nearly everyone presents 
in 1998 at about the same time that gold was pronouncing powerpoint s ubiquity in business the influential  engineer  could already write about broader uses 

 the world has run amok with the giddy power of presentation graphics a new language is in the air and it is codified in powerpoint  in a family discussion about what to do on a given evening for example i feel like pulling out my laptop and giving a  presentation   in church i am surprised that the preachers haven t caught on yet  how have we gotten on so long without powerpoint 

over a decade or so beginning in the mid 1990s powerpoint began to be used in many communication situations well beyond its original business presentation uses to include teaching in schools and in universities lecturing in scientific meetings  and preparing their related poster sessions  worshipping in churches making legal arguments in courtrooms displaying supertitles in theaters driving helmet-mounted displays in spacesuits for nasa astronauts giving military briefings issuing governmental reports undertaking diplomatic negotiations writing novels giving architectural demonstrations prototyping website designs creating animated video games creating art projects and even as a substitute for writing engineering technical reports and as an organizing tool for writing general business documents by 2003 it seemed that powerpoint was being used everywhere julia keller reported for the chicago tribune 

powerpoint  is one of the most pervasive and ubiquitous technological tools ever concocted in less than a decade it has revolutionized the worlds of business education science and communications swiftly becoming the standard for just about anybody who wants to explain just about anything to just about anybody else from corporate middle managers reporting on production goals to 4th-graders fashioning a show-and-tell on the french and indian war to church pastors explicating the seven deadly sins  powerpoint seems poised for world domination 
cultural reactions 
as uses broadened cultural awareness of powerpoint grew and commentary about it began to appear  with the widespread adoption of powerpoint came complaints  often very general statements reflecting dissatisfaction with modern media and communication practices as well as the dysfunctions of organizational culture  indications of this awaremess included increasing mentions of powerpoint use in the  comic strips of  comic parodies of poor or inappropriate use such as the  in powerpoint or summaries of shakespeare s hamlet and nabokov s lolita in powerpoint and a vast number of publications on the general subject of powerpoint especially about how to use it out of all the analyses of powerpoint over a quarter of a century at least three general themes emerged as categories of reaction to its broader use   1   use it less  avoid powerpoint in favor of alternatives such as using more-complex graphics and written prose or using nothing   2   use it differently  make a major change to a powerpoint style that is simpler and pictorial turning the presentation toward a performance more like a steve jobs keynote  and  3   use it better  retain much of the conventional powerpoint style but learn to avoid making many kinds of mistakes that can interfere with communication use it less

an early reaction was that the broader use of powerpoint was a mistake and should be reversed an influential example of this came from  an authority on information design who has been a professor of political science statistics and computer science at princeton and yale but is best known for his self-published books on data visualization which have sold nearly 2million copies as of 2014 in 2003 he published a widely-read booklet titled the cognitive style of powerpoint revised in 2006 tufte found a number of problems with the  cognitive style  of powerpoint many of which he attributed to the standard default style templates 

powerpoint s convenience for some presenters is costly to the content and the audience these costs arise from the cognitive style characteristics of the standard default pp presentation  foreshortening of evidence and thought low spatial resolution an intensely hierarchical single-path structure as the model for organizing every type of content breaking up narratives and data into slides and minimal fragments rapid temporal sequencing of thin information rather than focused spatial analysis conspicuous chartjunk and pp phluff branding of slides with logotypes a preoccupation with format not content incompetent designs for data graphics and tables and a smirky commercialism that turns information into a sales pitch and presenters into marketeers  
tufte particularly advised against using powerpoint for reporting scientific analyses using as a dramatic example some slides made during the flight of the space shuttle columbia after it had been damaged by an accident at liftoff slides which poorly communicated the engineers  limited understanding of what had happened pp814  for such technical presentations and for most occasions apart from its initial domain of sales presentations tufte advised against using powerpoint at all  in many situations according to tufte it would be better to substitute high-resolution graphics or concise prose documents as handouts for the audience to study and discuss providing a great deal more detail many commentators enthusiastically joined in tufte s vivid criticism of powerpoint uses and at a conference held in 2013  a decade after tufte s booklet appeared  one paper claimed that  despite all the criticism about his work tufte can be considered as the single most influential author in the discourse on powerpoint  while his approach was not rigorous from a research perspective his articles received wide resonance with the public at large     there were also others who disagreed with tufte s assertion that the powerpoint program reduces the quality of presenters  thoughts   professor of psychology at mit and later harvard had earlier argued that  if anything powerpoint if used well would ideally reflect the way we think  pinker later reinforced this opinion   any general opposition to powerpoint is just dumb  it s like denouncing lecturesbefore there were awful powerpoint presentations there were awful scripted lectures unscripted lectures slide shows chalk talks and so on 
much of the early commentary on all sides was  informal  and  anecdotal  because empirical research had been limited use it differently

a second reaction to powerpoint use was to say that powerpoint can be used well but only by substantially changing its style of use this reaction is exemplified by  a professor of psychology at the university of california santa barbara who has studied cognition and learning particularly the design of educational multimedia and who has published more than 500 publications including over 30 books mayer s theme has been that  in light of the science it is up to us to make a fundamental shift in our thinkingwe can no longer expect people to struggle to try to adapt to our powerpoint habits instead we have to change our powerpoint habits to align with the way people learn 
tufte had argued his judgment that the information density of text on powerpoint slides was too low perhaps only 40 words on a slide leading to over-simplified messages  mayer responded that his empirical research showed exactly the opposite that the amount of text on powerpoint slides was usually too high and that even fewer than 40 words on a slide resulted in  powerpoint overload  that impeded understanding during presentations mayer suggested a few major changes from traditional powerpoint formats 

replacing brief slide titles with longer  headlines  expressing complete ideas 
showing more slides but simpler ones 
removing almost all text including nearly all bullet lists  reserving the text for the spoken narration 
using larger higher-quality and more important graphics and photographs 
removing all extraneous decoration backgrounds logos and identifications everything but the essential message 
mayer s ideas are claimed by  to have been reflected in steve jobs s presentations   mayer outlined fundamental principles of multimedia design based on what scientists know about cognitive functioning steve jobs s slides adhere to each of mayer s principles   p92  though not unique to jobs many people saw the style for the first time in jobs s famous product introductions steve jobs would have been using apple s  which was designed for jobs s own slide shows beginning in 2003 but gallo says that  speaking like jobs has little to do with the type of presentation software you use  powerpoint keynote,etc   all the techniques apply equally to powerpoint and keynote pp14,46  gallo adds that  microsoft s powerpoint has one big advantage over apple s keynote presentation softwareit s everywhere  it s safe to say that the number of keynote presentations is miniscule in comparison with powerpoint although most presentation designers who are familiar with both formats prefer to work in the more elegant keynote system those same designers will tell you that the majority of their client work is done in powerpoint p44 
consistent with its association with steve jobs s keynotes a response to this style has been that it is particularly effective for  ballroom-style presentations   as often given in conference center ballrooms  where a celebrated and practiced speaker addresses a large passive audience but less appropriate for  conference room-style presentations  which are often recurring internal business meetings for in-depth discussion with motivated counterparts use it better

a third reaction to powerpoint use was to conclude that the standard style is capable of being used well but that many small points need to be executed carefully to avoid impeding understanding this kind of analysis is particularly associated with  a cognitive neuroscientist who specializes in the psychology of learning and visual communication and who has been head of the department of psychology at harvard has been director of stanford s center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences and has published some 300 papers and 14 books kosslyn presented a set of psychological principles of  human perception memory and comprehension  that  appears to capture the major points of agreement among researchers  he reports that his experiments support the idea that that it is not intuitive or obvious how to create effective powerpoint presentations that conform to those agreed principles and that even small differences that might not seem significant to a presenter can produce very different results in audiences  understanding for this reason kosslyn says users need specific education to be able to identify best ways to avoid  flaws and failures 

specifically we hypothesized and found that the psychological principles are often violated in powerpoint slideshows across different fields   that some types of presentation flaws are noticeable and annoying to audience members   and that observers have difficulty identifying many violations in graphical displays in individual slides   these studies converge in painting the following picture  powerpoint presentations are commonly flawed  some types of flaws are more common than others  flaws are not isolated to one domain or context  and although some types of flaws annoy the audience flaws at the level of slide design are not always obvious to an untrained observer   
the many  flaws and failures  identified were those  likely to disrupt the comprehension or memory of the material  among the most common examples were  bulleted items are not presented individually growing the list from the top to the bottom   more than four bulleted items appear in a single list   more than two lines are used per bulleted sentence  and  words are not large enough  i.e greater than 20 point  to be easily seen  among audience reactions common problems reported were  speakers read word-for-word from notes or from the slides themselves   the slides contained too much material to absorb before the next slide was presented  and  the main point was obscured by lots of irrelevant detail 
kosslyn observes that these findings could help to explain why the many studies of instructional effectiveness of powerpoint have been inconclusive and conflicting if there were differences in the quality of the presentations tested in different studies that went unobserved because  many may feel that  good design  is intuitively clear 
in 2007 kosslyn wrote a book about powerpoint in which he suggested a very large number of fairly modest changes to powerpoint styles and gave advice on recommended ways of using powerpoint in a later second book about powerpoint he suggested nearly 150 clarifying style changes  in fewer than 150 pages  kosslyn summarizes pp23,200 

 there s nothing fundamentally wrong with the powerpoint program as a medium  rather i claim that the problem lies in how it is used  in fact this medium is a remarkably versatile tool that can be extraordinarily effective  for many purposes powerpoint presentations are a superior medium of communication which is why they have become standard in so many fields 
in 2017 an online poll of social media users in the uk was reported to show that powerpoint  remains as popular with young tech-savvy users as it is with the baby boomers  with about four out of five saying that  powerpoint was a great tool for making presentations  in part because  powerpoint with its capacity to be highly visual bridges the wordy world of yesterday with the visual future of tomorrow  also in 2017 the managerial communication group of  polled their incoming mba students finding that  results underscore just how differently this generation communicates as compared with older workers  fewer than half of respondents reported doing any meaningful longer-form writing at work and even that minority mostly did so very infrequently but  85 percent of students named producing presentations as a meaningful part of their job responsibilities two-thirds report that they present on a daily or weekly basisso it s no surprise that in-person presentations is the top skill they hope to improve  one of the researchers concluded   we re not likely to see future workplaces with long-form writing the trend is toward presentations and slides and we don t see any sign of that slowing down 
u.s military excess 
use of powerpoint by the u.s military services began slowly because they were invested in mainframe computers ms-dos pcs and specialized military-specification graphic output devices all of which powerpoint did not support but because of the strong military tradition of presenting  as soon as they acquired the computers needed to run it powerpoint became part of the u.s military by 2000 ten years after powerpoint for windows appeared it was already identified as an important feature of u.s armed forces culture in a front-page story in the wall street journal 

old-fashioned slide briefings designed to update generals on troop movements have been a staple of the military since world war ii but in only a few short years powerpoint has altered the landscape just as word processing made it easier to produce long meandering memos the spread of powerpoint has unleashed a blizzard of jazzy but often incoherent visuals instead of drawing up a dozen slides on a legal pad and running them over to the graphics department captains and colonels now can create hundreds of slides in a few hours without ever leaving their desks if the spirit moves them they can build in gunfire sound effects and images that explode like land mines  powerpoint has become such an ingrained part of the defense culture that it has seeped into the military lexicon  powerpoint ranger  is a derogatory term for a desk-bound bureaucrat more adept at making slides than tossing grenades 
u.s military use of powerpoint may have influenced its use by armed forces of other countries   foreign armed services also are beginning to get in on the act  you can t speak with the u.s military without knowing powerpoint  says margaret hayes an instructor at national defense university in washington d.c who teaches latin american military officers how to use the software 
after another 10 years in 2010  and again on its front page  the new york times reported that powerpoint use in the military was then  a military tool that has spun out of control 

like an insurgency powerpoint has crept into the daily lives of military commanders and reached the level of near obsession the amount of time expended on powerpoint the microsoft presentation program of computer-generated charts graphs and bullet points has made it a running joke in the pentagon and in iraq and afghanistan  commanders say that behind all the powerpoint jokes are serious concerns that the program stifles discussion critical thinking and thoughtful decision-making not least it ties up junior officers  in the daily preparation of slides be it for a joint staff meeting in washington or for a platoon leader s pre-mission combat briefing in a remote pocket of afghanistan 
the new york times account went on to say that as a result some u.s generals had banned the use of powerpoint in their operations 

 powerpoint makes us stupid  gen  of the marine corps the joint forces commander said this month at a military conference in north carolina  he spoke without powerpoint  brig gen  who banned powerpoint presentations when he led the successful effort to secure the northern iraqi city of tal afar in 2005 followed up at the same conference by likening powerpoint to an internal threat  it s dangerous because it can create the illusion of understanding and the illusion of control  general mcmaster said in a telephone interview afterward  some problems in the world are not bullet-izable 

several incidents about the same time gave wide currency to discussions by serving military officers describing excessive powerpoint use and the organizational culture that encouraged it in response to the new york times story  and  sent a joint letter to the editor stressing the institutional culture of the military    many military personnel bemoan the overuse and misuse of powerpoint  the problem is not in the tool itself but in the way that people use itwhich is partly a result of how institutions promote misuse the two generals who had been mentioned in 2010 as opposing the institutional culture of excessive powerpoint use were both in the news again in 2017 when  became u.s secretary of defense and  was appointed as u.s national security advisor artistic medium 
musician  has been using powerpoint as a medium for art for years producing a book and dvd and showing at galleries his powerpoint-based artwork byrne has written   i have been working with powerpoint the ubiquitous presentation software as an art medium for a number of years it started off as a joke  this software is a symbol of corporate salesmanship or lack thereof  but then the work took on a life of its own as i realized i could create pieces that were moving despite the limitations of the  medium 
in 2005 byrne toured with a theater piece styled as a powerpoint presentation when he presented it in berkeley on march 8 2005 the university of california news service reported   byrne also defended its  powerpoint s  appeal as more than just a business toolas a medium for art and theater his talk was titled  i  powerpoint    berkeley alumnus bob gaskins and dennis austin  were in the audience   eventually byrne said powerpoint could be the foundation for  presentational theater  with roots in brechtian drama and asian puppet theater  after that performance byrne described it in his own online journal   did the powerpoint talk in berkeley for an audience of it legends and academics i was terrified the guys that originally turned powerpoint into a program were there what were they gonna think    did tell me afterwards that he liked the powerpoint as theater idea which was a relief 
the expressions  powerpoint art  or   are used to define a contemporary italian artistic movement which believes that the corporate world can be a unique and exceptional source of inspiration for the artist they say   the pptart name refers to powerpoint the symbolic and abstract language developed by the corporate world which has become a universal and highly symbolic communication system beyond cultures and borders 
the wide use of powerpoint had by 2010 given rise to    a subculture of powerpoint enthusiasts  is teaching the old application new tricks and may even be turning a dry presentation format into a full-fledged artistic medium  by using  to create  games artworks anime and movies 
powerpoint viewer 
powerpoint viewer is the name for a series of small free application programs to be used on computers without powerpoint installed to view project or print  but not create or edit  presentations the first version was introduced with powerpoint 3.0 in 1992 to enable electronic presentations to be projected using conference-room computers and to be freely distributed  on windows it took advantage of the new feature of embedding  fonts within powerpoint presentation files to make such distribution easier the same kind of viewer app was shipped with powerpoint 3.0 for macintosh also in 1992 beginning with powerpoint 2003 a feature called  package for cd  automatically managed all linked video and audio files plus needed fonts when exporting a presentation to a disk or flash drive or network location and also included a copy of a revised powerpoint viewer application so that the result could be presented on other pcs without installing anything the latest version that runs on windows  was created in conjunction with powerpoint 2010 but it can also be used to view newer presentations created in powerpoint 2013 and powerpoint 2016  all transitions videos and effects appear and behave the same when viewed using powerpoint viewer as they do when viewed in powerpoint 2010  it supports presentations created using powerpoint 97 and later the latest version that runs on macintosh is powerpoint 98 viewer for the  and  for macs supporting system 7.5 to   10.4  it can open presentations only from powerpoint 3.0 4.0 and 8.0  powerpoint 98  although presentations created on mac can be opened in powerpoint viewer on windows as of 2017 the latest versions of powerpoint viewer for windows  2010  and for macintosh  1998  remain available for download since powerpoint 2013 the recommended replacement for powerpoint viewer has been to use any computer with a browser and network access to display any accessible powerpoint presentation by using the free web app  versions

file formats 

binary  19872007 
early versions of powerpoint from 1987 through 1995  versions 1.0 through 7.0  evolved through a sequence of binary file formats different in each version as functionality was added that resulted in a stable binary format  called appt file like all earlier binary formats  that was shared as the default in powerpoint 97 through powerpoint 2003 for windows and in powerpoint 98 through powerpoint 2004 for mac  that is in powerpoint versions 8.0 through 11.0  the specification document is actively maintained and can be freely downloaded because although no longer the default that binary format can be read and written by some later versions of powerpoint including the current powerpoint 2016 after the stable binary format was adopted versions of powerpoint continued to be able to read and write differing file formats from earlier versions but beginning with powerpoint 2007 and powerpoint 2008 for mac  powerpoint version 12.0  this was the only binary format available for saving  powerpoint 2007  version 12.0  no longer supported saving to binary file formats used earlier than powerpoint 97  version 8.0  ten years before binary

the big change in powerpoint 2007 and powerpoint 2008 for mac  powerpoint version 12.0  was that the stable binary file format of 972003 was replaced as the default by a new based  format pptx files  microsoft s explanation of the benefits of the change included  smaller file sizes up to 75 smaller than comparable binary documents  security through being able to identify and exclude executable macros and personal data  less chance to be corrupted than binary formats  and easier interoperability for exchanging data among microsoft and other business applications all while maintaining backward compatibility xml

the specification for the new format was published as an   through  technical committee 45  tc45  the ecma 376 stardard was approved in december 2006 and was submitted for standardization through  wg4 in early 2007 the  was contentious it was approved as  in early 2008 copies of the iso iec standard specification are freely available in two parts these define two related standards known as  transitional  and  strict  the two standards were progressively adopted by powerpoint  powerpoint version 12.0  2007 2008 for mac  could read and write transitional format but could neither read nor write strict format powerpoint version 14.0  2010 2011 for mac  could read and write transitional and also read but not write strict powerpoint version 15.0 and later  beginning 2013 2016 for mac  can read and write both transitional and strict formats the reason for the two variants was explained by microsoft 

 the participants in the iso iec standardization process recognized two objectives with competing requirements the first objective was for the open xml standard to provide an xml-based file format that could fully support conversion of the billions of existing office documents without any loss of features content text layout or other information including embedded data the second was to specify a file format that did not rely on microsoft-specific data types they created two variants of open xmltransitional which supports previously-defined microsoft-specific data types and strict which does not rely on them prior versions of office  that is 2007  have supported reading and writing transitional open xml and office 2010 can read strict open xml documents with the addition of write support for strict open xml office 2013 provides full support for both variants of open xml 
the powerpointpptx file format  called   for presentation markup language  contains separate structures for all the complex parts of a powerpoint presentation the specification documents run to over sixthousand pages because of the widespread use of powerpoint the standardized file formats are considered important for the long-term access to digital documents in library collections and archives according to the u.s library of congress powerpoint 2013 and powerpoint 2016 provide options to set default saving to iso iec 29500 strict format but the initial default setting remains transitional for compatibility with legacy features incorporating binary data in existing documents powerpoint 2013 or powerpoint 2016 will both open and save files in the former binary format ppt  for compatibility with older versions of the program  but not versions older than powerpoint 97  in saving to older formats these versions of powerpoint will check to assure that no features have been introduced into the presentation which are incompatible with the older formats powerpoint 2013 and 2016 will also save a presentation in many other file formats including  format  or  video as a sequence of single-picture files  using image formats including     and some older formats  and as a single presentation file in which all slides are replaced with pictures powerpoint will both open and save files in  format  odp  for compatibility see also
