an equator is the intersection of the surface of a    such as a   with the  perpendicular to the  and midway between its  on  the equator is an imaginary line on the surface equidistant from the  and  dividing the earth into  and  it is about 40,075 kilometres  24,901mi  long of which 78.7 lies across water and 21.3 over land

locations on the equator experience the quickest  and  because the sun moves nearly perpendicular to the horizon for most of the year the length of daylight  sunrise to sunset  is almost constant throughout the year  it is about fourteen minutes longer than nighttime due to  and the fact that sunrise is begun  or sunset is ended  as the upper edge not the centre of the sun s disk crosses the  the earth   the  average  diameter of the earth is 12,750 kilometres  7,922mi  but the diameter at the equator is about 43 kilometres  27mi  greater than at the poles sites near the equator such as the  in   are good locations for  as they have a faster rotational speed than other latitudes  the added velocity reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft because the earth spins to the east spacecraft must also launch to the east  or to the southeast or northeast  to take advantage of this earth-boost of speed further information   and 
precise location 
the precise location of the equator is not truly fixed  the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the earth s spin axis which  about 9 metres  30ft  during a year this effect must be accounted for in detailed  measurements in two widely used  standards the equator is modelled as a circle whose radius is a  of metres in 1976 the  chose a radius of 6,378.140 kilometres  3,963.192mi   codified as the iau-1976 value  later refined by the  to 6,378.137 kilometres  3,963.191mi  and adopted in  despite this change the yet more recent iau-2000 retained the old iau-1976 value if it were really circular the length of the equator would be exactly 2 times the radius namely 40,075.036 kilometres  24,901.473mi  however due to the effect of  on the earth s surface the actual circumference at the equator is about 40,075.16 kilometres  24,901.55mi  the  is defined as one arc minute of the equator so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed for example by wsg-84 the distance is 1,855.3248 metres  6,087.024ft  while by iau-2000 it is 1,855.3257 metres  6,087.027ft  this is a difference of less than one millimeter over the total distance  approximately 1.86 kilometres  1.16mi  the earth is commonly modeled as a sphere flattened 0.336 along its axis this makes the equator 0.16 longer than a   a great circle passing through the two poles  the iugg standard meridian is to the nearest millimetre 40,007.862917 kilometres  24,859.733480mi  one arc minute of which is 1,852.216 metres  6,076.82ft  explaining the  standardization of the  as 1,852 metres  6,076ft  more than 3 metres  9.8ft  less than the  the sea-level surface of the earth  the   is irregular so the actual length of the equator is not so easy to determine aviation week and space technology on 9 october 1961 reported that measurements using the transit iv-a satellite had shown the equatorial  diameter  from longitude 11 west to 169 east to be 1,000 feet  300m  greater than its  diameter  ninety degrees away 
crossing-the-equator ceremonies

certain navies such as the   and  have a tradition of holding ceremonies aboard ships to mark sailors  first crossing of the equator these rites of initiation have in the past been notorious for their brutality  milder line-crossing ceremonies typically featuring  are also held for passengers  entertainment on some civilian ocean liners and cruise ships

seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth s axis relative to the plane of revolution during the year the northern and southern hemispheres are inclined toward or away from the sun according to earth s position in its orbit the hemisphere inclined toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter  see   at the  the earth s axis is not tilted toward the sun instead it is perpendicular to the sun meaning that the day is about 12 hours long as is the night across the whole of the earth the equator lies mostly on the three largest   the  the  and the  near the equator there is little temperature fluctuation throughout the year though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity the terms summer autumn winter and spring do not generally apply lowlands around the equator generally have a  also known as an equatorial climate though cold currents cause some regions to have  with a  in the middle of the year and the  generated by  due to continental heating via the high  causes  to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location average annual temperatures in equatorial lowlands are around 30c  86f  during the day and 23c  73f  at night rainfall is away from cold current upwelling zones very high from 2,500 to 3,500mm  98 to 138in  per year average rainy days are around 200 per year and average annual sunshine hours around 2,000 despite high year-round sea level temperatures some higher altitudes such as the  and  sustain glaciers the highest point on the equator is at the elevation of 4,690 metres  15,387ft  at  found on the southern slopes of   summit 5,790 metres  18,996ft  in  this is slightly above the  and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground at the equator the snow line is around 1,000 metres  3,280ft  lower than on  and as much as 2,000 metres  6,560ft  lower than the highest snow line in the world near the  on
