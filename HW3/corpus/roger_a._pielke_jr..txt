on the issues of  he has argued that the trend in increasing damage from hurricanes is primarily due to societal and economic factors  chiefly an increase in wealth density  rather than change in the frequency and intensity pielke has been labeled a  skeptic  and  denier  of  though pielke strongly objects to those labels his views on climate change have been widely criticized by scientists including us presidential science adviser  pielke rejected holdren s criticisms saying  the facts are on my side  and several publications defended pielke in october 2016 in a  disclosed by wikileaks  the editor of  a site that is part of the center for american progress action fund states that a thinkprogress blog helped to discredit  and get him fired from the  website but  reported on this in 2014 fivethirtyeight published a pielke article in march 2014 that climate scientists  and  criticized as  deeply misleading  and  demonstrably wrong  in interviews with thinkprogress the scientists said that pielke sent them threatening e-mails in response to their criticism calling it  libelous  pielke responded that their characterization of his e-mails as  threatening  was  ridiculous  legum told the huffington post that he contacted  the editor of fivethirtyeight which apologized to the two scientists for pielke s behavior other criticisms of pielke s article followed  published an article by dana nuccitelli called  fivethirtyeight undermines its brand by misrepresenting climate research  and  wrote that pielke s  conclusions are not taken seriously by myself and other climate scientists

pielke was also named in a letter sent by senator   dma  to numerous energy industry groups asking them to disclose the names of scientists they had funded regarding  disclosures pielke said that  if you look at our community the failure to disclose conflicts of interest is fairly endemic
