this article is about the pacific hurricane typhoon of 1994 for other storms of the same name see  
hurricane john also known as typhoon john was both the longest-lasting and the farthest-traveling  ever observed john formed during the  which had above average activity due to the  of 199495 and peaked as a category5 hurricane on the  the highest categorization for hurricanes over the course of its existence it followed a 7,165-mile  13,280-km  path from the eastern pacific to the western pacific and back to the central pacific lasting 31days in total because it existed in both the eastern and western pacific john was one of a small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon despite lasting for a full month john barely affected land at all bringing only minimal effects to the  and the united states  on  its remnants later affected alaska

the origins of hurricane john were thought by the united states   nhc  to be from a  that moved off the coast of africa on july 25 1994 the wave subsequently moved across the atlantic ocean and caribbean without distinction before it crossed central america and moved into the eastern pacific ocean on or around august 8 upon entering the eastern pacific the wave gradually developed before the nhc initiated advisories on the system and designated it as tropical depression ten-e during august 11 the system was at this time moving westwards and located around 345 miles  555km  to the south-southeast of  mexico quickly developing banding features and well-defined outflow it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named john later that day a strong ridge of high pressure over the northeastern pacific ocean forced john westward where upper level  kept john a tropical storm intensity fluctuated considerably however as shear levels varied more than once shear cleared away most of the clouds above john and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression however after eight days of slow westward movement across the pacific ocean shear lessened greatly on august 19 and john intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700  during an eighteen-hour period between august 19 and august 20 john further strengthened from a weak category1 hurricane to a major category3 hurricane around 1100 pdt on august 20 it crossed into the central pacific the first of three basin crosses john would make after entering the central pacific john left the area monitored by the nhc and was instead monitored by the   cphc  as it moved slowly westward hurricane john continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the   on 22 august john was designated a category5 hurricane on the   the highest classification for hurricanes  and later that day  by   reached its peak winds of 175miles per hour  280km h  also on august 22  by hawaii standard time  john made its closest approach to the hawaiian islands 345miles  500km  to the south john had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept john on its southerly path nonetheless heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of john affected the islands with the hawaiian islands behind it john began a slow turn to the north taking near-direct aim at  a small group of islands populated only by a united states military base the storm slowly weakened from its peak as a category5 hurricane in the face of increasing shear dropping down to a category1 hurricane with 90miles per hour  145km h  maximum winds on august 25 local time john made its closest approach to the johnston atoll only 15miles  24km  to the north on johnston atoll sustained winds were reported up to 60miles per hour  95km h  the equivalent of a strong tropical storm and gusts up to 75miles per hour  120km h  were recorded 



hurricane john at its tertiary peak strength in the far north-central pacific ocean there is also an extratropical cyclone attached north of john 

clearing johnston atoll john turned to the northwest and began strengthening again as shear decreased on august 27 local time john reached a secondary peak strength of 135miles per hour  210km h  and shortly thereafter it crossed the  at approximately 22  and came under the surveillance of the  branch of the   jtwc  by crossing into the western pacific john also became a typhoon and was referred to as typhoon john during its time in the western pacific immediately after crossing the date line john again weakened and its forward motion stalled by september 1 john had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the date line there john lingered for six days while performing a multi-day  loop on september 7 a trough moved into the area and quickly moved john to the northeast john crossed the date line again on september 8 and reentered the central pacific after reentering the central pacific john briefly reached a tertiary peak strength of 90miles per hour  145km h  a strong category1 hurricane well to the north of  however the trough was rapidly pulling apart john s structure and the cold waters of the northern central pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone on september 10 the 120th advisory was released on the system finally declaring john to have become  approximately 1000miles  1600km  south of  forecasting difficulties 
during john s time in the western north pacific the   jtwc  had particular difficulty in forecasting and even estimating the strength of john john weakened considerably after entering the western north pacific and before estimates were later revised four consecutive advisories were issued that declared john a tropical depression each of these advisories called for imminent dissipation as john persisted and did not dissipate as the jtwc had predicted it was upgraded to a minimal tropical storm in the next advisory at the same time however two separate ship reports indicated that john had sustained winds of at least 55  100km h 65mph  far stronger than the advisory strength of 35knots  65km h 40mph  john would go on to restrengthen into a strong category1 hurricane after reentering the central north pacific defying all jtwc predictions after later reanalysis the jtwc raised the estimated wind speeds of john for every advisory from 1200 utc september 1 to its final advisory exactly a week later by at least 5knots  9km h 6mph  and as much as 25knots  46km h 29mph  records 
its 31-day existence made john the longest-lasting tropical cyclone recorded in both the pacific ocean and worldwide surpassing both  s previous record in the pacific of 24days in the  and the  s previous world record of 28days in the  in addition despite its slow movement throughout much of its path john was the farthest-traveling tropical cyclone in both pacific ocean and worldwide with a distance traveled of 7,165miles  13,280km  out-distancing previous record holders  in the pacific of 4,700miles  8,700km  in the  and  worldwide of 6,850miles  12,700km  in the  pressure readings from john s peak are not consistently available as the cphc did not monitor pressures at the time but  aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929    making john one of the most intense hurricanes recorded in the central pacific  both  and  recorded a lower pressure in the central pacific earlier in the 1994 season but with lower wind speeds  intensity is measured by minimum central pressure which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds  john was also only the fourth category5 hurricane recorded in the central pacific  the first was  in  the second was hurricane emilia and the third one was hurricane gilma both earlier in 1994  and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central pacific hurricane 175mph  280km h  since 1994 only one category5 hurricane  has formed in or entered into the central pacific  ioke like emilia and gilma had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than john however john s pressure record is incomplete  the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph  there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175mph so it could have been stronger than emilia gilma or ioke john was the first eastern pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon a feat only matched by  in  additionally counting only storms recognized by all north pacific official  john was only the third of five tropical cyclones to exist in all three  in the pacific ocean the others were  and hurricanes   and  in    and  respectively also john was the fifth of seven tropical cyclones to enter the central pacific from the western pacific hurricanes  and  and tropical storms  and  in    and  respectively had done so previously and only  and  in  and  respectively did so later finally john was one of only five tropical cyclones to cross the date line twice alongside hurricanes patsy and skip tropical storm carmen and tropical depression 17w impact

john affected both the  and  but only lightly while john passed over 345miles  550km  to the south of hawaii the islands did experience strengthened trade winds and rough surf along the southeast and south-facing shores and while moving westward on west-facing shores as well the waves ranging from 6 to 10ft  1.8 to 3.0m  in height flooded beach parks in  additionally heavy rains on the  caused minor localized flooding and some short-term road closures no deaths injuries or significant damages were reported in hawaii although john passed within 25km  16mi  of  it had weakened greatly to a category1 system by closest approach prior to the storm s arrival waves between 20 and 30ft  6.1 and 9.1m  were reported on the island additionally in the northern hemisphere the strongest winds and heaviest rain lie to the north of a tropical cyclone so the atoll which lay to the south of the storm s path was spared the brunt of the storm nonetheless the 1,100-man personnel for the united states military base on johnston atoll had been evacuated to  as a precaution while john approached damage to structures was considerable but the size of the island and relative functionality of the base led to low damage  monetary losses were estimated at close to  15million  1994 us  the remnants of john moved through the  producing a wind gust of 46mph  74km h  in  the storm brought a plume of warm air and two stations recorded a high temperature of 66f  19c  see also
