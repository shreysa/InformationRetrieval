puerto rico has an  of about u.s 9.8 billion with expenses at about  10.4 billion  creating a structural deficit of  775 million  about 7.9 of the budget  the practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 17 consecutive years starting in 2000 throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments this practice eroded puerto rico s treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds  for four decades since 1973 



the 2012 budget of the government of puerto rico


projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued  of  71b or about 70 of puerto rico s gross domestic product this sparked  after puerto rico s general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade  junk status  by three credit rating agencies in terms of financial control almost 9.6%or about  1.5 billionof puerto rico s central government budget expenses for fy2014 is expected to be spent on debt service harsher budget cuts are expected as puerto rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years 
for practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects  a  general budget  which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the  and the  consolidated budget  which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget by  by revenue expected from loans by the sale of government bonds by subsidies extended by the  and by other funds both budgets contrast each other drastically with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget  currently  29b and  9.0b respectively almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from u.s federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31 of the consolidated budget the critical aspects come from the sale of bonds which comprise 7 of the consolidated budget  a ratio that increased annually due to the government s inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses in particular the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt as not a single one is self-sufficient all of them carrying extremely inefficient operations for example in fy2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than  1.3b with the   prhta  reporting losses of  409m the   prepa  the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island  reporting losses of  272m while the   prasa  the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island  reported losses of  112m losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40 of puerto rico s entire public debt today holistically from fy2000fy2010 puerto rico s debt grew at a   cagr  of 9 while gdp remained stagnant this has not always provided a long-term solution in early july 2017 for example the prepa power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure  9 billion in bond debt  the agency planned to seek court protection in terms of protocol the governor together with the   ogp in spanish  formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year he then submits this formulation as a budget request to the puerto rican legislature before july 1 the date established by law as the beginning of puerto rico s fiscal year while the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted  at the beginning of each regular session  the request is typically submitted during the first week of may as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in january and it would be unpractical to submit a request so far ahead once submitted the budget is then approved by the legislature typically with amendments through a  and referred back to the governor for his approval the governor then either approves it or vetoes it if vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor s approval or approve it without the governor s consent by two-thirds of the bodies of each chamber once approved the department of treasury disburses funds to the office of management and budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies all while the   the government s intergovernmental bank  manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government-owned corporations cost of living
