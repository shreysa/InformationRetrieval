the convair cv-240 is an american  produced by  from 1947 to 1954 initially as a possible replacement of the ubiquitous  featuring a more modern design with  the 240 series was able to make some inroads as a commercial airliner and also had a long development cycle which resulted in various civil and military variants although reduced in numbers through attrition the  convairliners  in various forms continue to fly into the 21st century

design and development 
the design began its life in a requirement by  for an airliner to replace its  convair s original design the unpressurised model 110 was a twin-engine low-wing  of all-metal construction with 30 seats it was powered by   and had a  and a ventral  for passenger boarding the prototype model 110  nx90653 first flew on july 8 1946 by this time american had changed its requirements to require  and deemed the design too small the first prototype was used by convair for development work for the 240 series before being broken up in 1947 



a 1949-built convair 240 of  at  england in march 1950


to meet the requirements of airlines for a pressurized airliner convair produced a revised designthe model 240 this had a longer but thinner fuselage than the model 110 accommodating 40 passengers in the first pressurized twin-engined airliner the 240 first flew on march 16 1947 the model 240 was followed by the model 340 that had a longer fuselage longer-span wings and more powerful engines the 340 first flew on october 5 1951 in 1954 in an attempt to compete withpowered airliners like the  convair produced the model 440 metropolitan with more streamlined cowlings new engine exhausts and better soundproofing for the cabin as the  super 240  evolved into the cv-340 and cv-440 the limit of piston-engine performance was reached and future development centered on conversion to turboprop power operational history 
the first delivery of a production convairliner was to american on february 29 1948 a total of 75 were delivered to american with another 50 going to       and  



two convair 580s of the based  at  in  us in 1986


a cv-240 was the first private aircraft used in a united states presidential campaign in 1960  used a cv-240 named caroline  after his daughter  during his campaign this aircraft is now preserved in the  after aborted negotiations with twa and eastern for  super 240  orders the production of the 240 series was temporarily halted in response to a united inquiry convair redesigned the super 240 calling it the cv-340 united ordered 55 and more us orders came from braniff continental delta northeast and national other orders came from abroad and the cv-340 proved popular in south america the cv-340 earned an enviable reputation for reliability and profitability and was developed into the cv-440 metropolitan the final piston-engined variant of the  convairliners 
 the major remaining operator of this model currently holds the  for this aircraft used price for a convair 240 in 1960 was around 40,000 variants
