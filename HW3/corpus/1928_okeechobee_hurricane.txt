on september6 ships reported a tropical depression developing just off the west coast of africa near   the next day a ship reported winds of 60mph  95km h  or tropical storm status  on this basis the  estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on september6 however lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the atlantic ocean on september10 the s.s commack first observed the storm about 900miles  1450km  to the east of  which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship s radio later that day two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm and the  estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18 00 on september10

while the storm was passing near dominica the san juan puerto rico weather bureau warned about the threat of the hurricane which would strike the island within a day or two the advisory was sent via  to 75police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours  this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio warnings were also posted for 12ports along the southern coast causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312 and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of puerto rico by comparison the weaker  killed approximately 3,000people according to the san juan national weather service office the storm was  up to this time the greatest and more    intense and destructive hurricane of record in puerto rico  along the storm path the eye passed over guayama cayey and aibonito resulting in a period of calm lasting 20minutes the island of puerto rico received the worst of the storm s winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at category 5 strength the hurricane was extremely large as it crossed puerto rico hurricane-force winds were measured in  for 18hours  since the storm is estimated to have been moving at 13mph  21km h  the diameter of the storm s hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234miles  376km  the storm was named the san felipe ii hurricane because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the christian  of saint philip it was named  segundo  spanish for  the second  because of another destructive   which struck puerto rico on that same day in 1876 since european arrival in the americas in 1492 all storms and hurricanes were named after the name of the saint of the day the storm hit puerto rico in 1953 the united states started naming hurricanes by female names until 1978 when both gender names began to be used yet it was only in 1960 that hurricanes stopped being officially named after saints the rainfall recorded on september 1314 1928 remains the record for the maximum rainfall associated with a hurricane in puerto rico within a period of forty-eight hours in those regions where precipitation is more common place as in adjuntas in the  and in the sierra de luquillo the rain was over 25 inches  640mm  with 29.60 inches  752mm  recorded in adjuntas the  located in  lost one of its cups at 11 44am on september 13 just when it had registered a maximum speed of 150 miles  240km  per houra speed that was sustained for five consecutive minutes previously the same instrument had measured 160 miles  260km  per hour for one minute because these measurements were taken 30 miles  48km  from san felipe s eye at the time it seemed possible that some estimates of 200 miles  320km  per hour near the center of the storm were not overdrawn there was general destruction through the island with the towns where the eye passed being swept away property damage on the island from winds and rain was catastrophic the northeast portion of the island received winds in excess of category3 strength with hurricane-force winds lasting as long as 18hours official reports stated  several hundred thousand  people were left homeless and property damages were estimated at  50million on the island there was no building that was not affected some sugar mills  centrales  that had cost millions of dollars to build were reduced to rubble reports say that 24,728 homes were destroyed and 192,444 were partially destroyed most of the  fields were flooded ruining the year s crops half of the  and half of the  that covered these were destroyed  almost all of the coffee harvest was lost the coffee industry would take years to recover since coffee needs shade trees to grow the tobacco farms also had great losses after this hurricane puerto rico never regained its position as a major coffee exporter communications were impacted by fallen trees landslides and damaged bridges of the school buildings 770were destroyed or damaged according to some estimates of the day excluding personal losses the damages reached  85.312million and over 500,000people were left homeless san felipe ii is officially classified as puerto rico s biggest worst and most devastating hurricane to ever have impacted the island greater antilles and bahamas 

after affecting puerto rico the hurricane passed just north of the  producing very little damage this was due to the small core and weaker winds to the south of the center advance warning reduced the number of ships traversing the region while the hurricane was passing nearby grand turk reported winds of 120mph  193km h  according to a ship report in the region  the force of the wind could only be judged by the noise made by the storm which reminded me of the new york subway going full speed passing switches  winds approached 120mph  193km h  at nassau before the anemometer failed in addition to the winds the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region totaling 9in  228mm  in nassau as in puerto rico authorities in the bahamas had ample warning of the hurricane s approach and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in grand turk although the crews were saved a  traversing from  to grand turk was lost killing all 18people on board the storm caused heavy damage throughout the bahamas mostly to property and crops in  some buildings which were recently repaired after the  were destroyed during this storm a 10-year-old girl drowned after falling into an open trench filled with water at the fort montague hotel the windows doors and furniture were badly damaged similar impact was reported at the royal victoria hotel while the british colonial hotel was largely spared however the gardens of the three hotels were  damaged almost beyond recognition  on  sustained winds of 140mph  230km h  were observed causing major damage to buildings ninety-five houses and some other buildings including a few churches and government buildings were damaged or destroyed on  minor damage was reported on  most of the food crops were destroyed on  four buildings were demolished including two churches while several other structures suffered minor damage food crops were nearly wiped out florida

inland the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of lake okeechobee residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule many thought it had missed and returned to their homes in the weeks prior to storm heavy rainfall caused the lake to rise 3ft  0.91m  between august10 and september10 and filled nearby canals and ditches precipitation from the hurricane itself caused lake okeechobee to rise further when the worst of the storm crossed the lake the south-blowing wind caused a  to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake the resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20ft  6m  deep houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered most survivors and bodies were washed out into the  where many of the bodies were never found agricultural losses in the area surrounding lake okeechobee were also significant with virtually all crops destroyed and over 150tractors suffering damage

burial of victims in west palm beach


floodwaters persisted for several weeks greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation burial services were quickly overwhelmed and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves around 75 of the fatalities were migrant farm workers making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult  as a result of this the count of the dead is not very accurate the  estimated the number of fatalities as 1,836 which was taken as the official count by the  for many years  and exactly equal to the official count for   older sources usually list 3,411 as the hurricane s total count of fatalities including the caribbean however in 2003 the u.s death count was revised to  at least  2,500 making the okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in united states history behind the  a mass grave at the port mayaca cemetery east of  contains the bodies of 1,600 victims of the hurricane central and north florida

in florida although the hurricane s destruction affected everything in its path the death toll was by far highest and the aftermath the worst in the economically poor areas in the low-lying ground right around lake okeechobee such as belle glade chosen pahokee south bay and bean city around 75 of the fatalities were among  most of whom were black the black workers did most of the post-hurricane cleanup work and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites additionally the white victims received a proper burial at woodlawn cemetery in downtown west palm beach which was the only mass gravesite to receive a timely memorial in contrast the bodies of black victims were burned in funeral pyres or thrown into mass burial sites such as the ones in  and port mayaca 



the historical marker added to the memorial site in 2003 the seventy-fifth anniversary of the storm


robert hazard a resident of west palm beach established the storm of  28 memorial park coalition inc to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm in 2000 the west palm beach burial site was reacquired by the city of west palm beach and plans for construction of a memorial began the  was listed on the   in 2002 and a state historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane the effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers were dramatized in african-american writer  s 1937 seminal novel  her best known work and a selection on  magazine s 2005 list of the 100 best english-language novels published since 1923 improved building codes 
in the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal florida it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings buildings with well-constructed frames and those made of steel concrete brick or stone were largely immune to winds and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings coming on the heels of the 1926 miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes flood control
