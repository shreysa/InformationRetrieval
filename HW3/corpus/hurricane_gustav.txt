 addressed in a  reflection  published on september 1 in the official daily   two days ago  out of 11 international press reports devoted to cuba none told about the hurricane that moved toward our island and the feverish efforts of our civil defense  castro writes instead the news services  echoing a yankee press organization dedicated to the media war and campaigns against cuba  reported about the defection of tv actor   the  yankee press organization  appears to be an allusion to  which broke the news of jaled s arrival in miami   what a patriot  what a democrat  what a brilliant example  wrote castro  this way the world is informed about a character a lot less known and important than hurricane gustav they want to make a sacred cow out of him
