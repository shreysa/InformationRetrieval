an anticyclone  that is opposite to a   is a   defined by the united states  s glossary as  a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure clockwise in the northern hemisphere counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere  effects of surface-based anticyclones include clearing skies as well as cooler drier air fog can also form overnight within a region of higher pressure mid-tropospheric systems such as the  deflect tropical cyclones around their periphery and cause a  inhibiting  near their center building up surface-based  under their base anticyclones aloft can form within warm core lows such as  due to descending cool air from the backside of upper troughs such as polar highs or from large scale sinking such as the subtropical ridge

history 
 first discovered anticyclones in the 1860s preferred areas within a  flow pattern in higher levels of the hydrosphere are beneath the western side of troughs or dips in the  pattern  high-pressure systems are alternatively referred to as anticyclones their circulation is sometimes referred to as  subtropical high pressure zones form under the descending portion of the  circulation upper-level high-pressure areas lie over tropical cyclones due to their warm core nature see also  
surface anticyclones form due to downward motion through the troposphere the atmospheric layer where weather occurs preferred areas within a  flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs on weather maps these areas show converging winds  isotachs  also known as  or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence which is near the 500 hpa pressure surface about midway up the troposphere because they weaken with height these high-pressure systems are cold subtropical ridge

main article  
heating of the earth near the equator forces upward motion and convection along the  or  the divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft as air moves towards the mid-latitudes it cools and sinks leading to subsidence near the 30 parallel of both hemispheres this circulation known as the  forms the subtropical ridge many of the world s deserts are caused by these climatological  because these anticyclones strengthen with height they are known as warm core ridges formation aloft 
the development of anticyclones aloft occurs in warm core cyclones such as  when latent heat caused by the formation of  is released aloft increasing the air temperature  the resultant thickness of the atmospheric layer increases high pressure aloft which evacuates their outflow strike 
in the absence of rotation the  tends to blow from areas of high pressure to  the stronger the pressure difference  pressure gradient  between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system the stronger the wind the  caused by  s rotation gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere  as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure  and anticlockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere  as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure  friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward  more   from the center effects

high-pressure systems are frequently associated with light winds at the surface and  of air from higher portions of the  subsidence will generally warm an air mass by   compressional  heating thus high pressure typically brings clear skies because no clouds are present to reflect sunlight during the day there is more incoming  and temperatures rise rapidly near the surface at night the absence of clouds means that   i.e heat energy from the surface  is not blocked giving cooler  in all seasons when surface winds become light the subsidence produced directly under a high-pressure system can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the high pressure leading to widespread  if the surface level  rises towards 100 percent overnight  can form the movement of continental arctic air masses to lower latitudes produces strong but vertically shallow high-pressure systems the surface level sharp temperature  can lead to areas of persistent  or  colloquially known as anticyclonic gloom the type of weather brought about by an anticyclone depends on its origin for example extensions of the azores high pressure may bring about anticyclonic gloom during the winter because they pick up moisture as they move over the warmer oceans high pressures that build to the north and move southwards often bring clear weather because they are cooled at the base  as opposed to warmed  which helps prevent clouds from forming once arctic air moves over an unfrozen ocean the air mass modifies greatly over the warmer water and takes on the character of a maritime air mass which reduces the strength of the high-pressure system when extremely cold air moves over relatively warm oceans  can develop however warm and moist  or maritime tropical  air masses which move poleward from tropical sources are slower to modify than arctic air masses mid-tropospheric systems

the circulation around mid-level  altitude  ridges and the air subsidence at their center act to steer tropical cyclones around their periphery due to the subsidence within this type of system a  can develop which inhibits free convection and hence mixing of the lower with the middle level troposphere this limits thunderstorm activity near their centers and traps low-level pollutants such as  as  under their base which is a significant problem in large urban centers during summer months such as  and  upper tropospheric systems 
the existence of upper-level  altitude  high pressure allows upper level  which leads to surface  if a capping mid-level ridge does not exist this leads to  and the development of showers and thunderstorms if the lower atmosphere is humid because a  loop develops between the convective tropical cyclone and the upper level high the two system are strengthened this loop stops once ocean temperatures cool to below 26.5c  79.7f  reducing the thunderstorm activity which then weakens the upper level high pressure system importance to global monsoon regimes
