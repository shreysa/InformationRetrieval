graupel  german pronunciation    english    also called soft hail or snow pellets is  that forms when  water  are collected and freeze on falling  forming 25mm  0.080.20in  balls of  the term graupel comes from the german language graupel is distinct from  small hail and   the  defines small hail as snow pellets encapsulated by ice a precipitation halfway between graupel and hail the  code for graupel is gs

falling graupel


under some  conditions  crystals may encounter  water  these droplets which have a diameter of about 10  0.00039in  can exist in the liquid  at temperatures as low as 40c  40f  far below the normal  point contact between a snow crystal and the supercooled droplets results in freezing of the liquid droplets onto the surface of the crystal this process of crystal growth is known as  crystals that exhibit frozen droplets on their surfaces are often referred to as  when this process continues so that the shape of the original snow crystal is no longer identifiable the resulting crystal is referred to as graupel graupel was formerly referred to by meteorologists as soft hail however graupel is easily distinguishable from hail in both the shape and strength of the pellet and the circumstances in which it falls ice from  is formed in hard relatively uniform layers and usually falls only during  graupel forms fragile oblong shapes and falls in place of typical  in  situations often in concert with  graupel is also fragile enough that it will typically fall apart when touched microscopic structure 




graupel encasing and hiding a snow crystal from view






rime on both ends of a columnar snow crystal


the frozen droplets on the surface of rimed crystals are difficult to see and the topography of a graupel particle is not easy to record with a  because of the limited  and  in the instrument however observations of snow crystals with a low-temperature   lt-sem  clearly show cloud droplets measuring up to 50m  0.002in  on the surface of the crystals the rime has been observed on all four basic forms of snow crystals including plates dendrites columns and needles as the riming process continues the mass of frozen accumulated cloud droplets obscures the form of the original snow crystal thereby giving rise to a graupel particle graupel and avalanches 
graupel commonly forms in high-altitude climates and is both denser and more  than ordinary  due to its rimed exterior macroscopically graupel resembles small beads of  the combination of density and low viscosity makes fresh layers of graupel unstable on slopes and layers of 2030cm  7.911.8in  present a high risk of dangerous slab  in addition thinner layers of graupel falling at low temperatures can act as ball bearings below subsequent falls of more naturally stable snow rendering them also liable to avalanche graupel tends to compact and stabilise  weld  approximately one or two days after falling depending on the temperature and the properties of the graupel references
