official tropical cyclone basins


traditionally areas of  formation are divided into seven basins these include the north  the eastern and western parts of the northern  the southwestern pacific the southwestern and southeastern  and the northern indian ocean   and   the western pacific is the most active and the north indian the least active an average of 86tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide with 47 reaching hurricane typhoon strength and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones  at least of  intensity

the northeastern pacific is the second most active basin and has the highest number of storms per unit area the  runs between may 15 and november 30 each year and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region in the 19712005 period there were an average of 1516 tropical storms 9  and 45 major hurricanes  storms of  or greater  annually in the basin storms that form here often affect western  and less commonly the   in particular   or northern  no hurricane included in the modern database has made landfall in california  however historical records from 1858 speak of a  that brought  winds over 75mph  65kn  121km h   marginal hurricane force  though it is not known if the storm actually made landfall tropical storms in   and  brought gale-force winds to california the  s   aor  begins at the boundary with the   aor  at 140  and ends at the international date line where the northwestern pacific begins the hurricane season in the north central pacific runs annually from june 1 to november 30  the central pacific hurricane center monitors the storms that develop or move into the defined area of responsibility the cphc previously tasked with monitoring tropical activity in the basin was originally known as the   today it is called the  central pacific hurricanes are rare and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move in this area annually as there are no large contiguous landmasses in the basin direct hits and  are rare  however they occur occasionally as with  in 1992 which made landfall on  and  in 2006 which made a direct hit on

within the  tropical cyclones generally form on a regular basis between the african coast and the middle of the south pacific tropical and subtropical cyclones have also been noted occurring in the southern atlantic ocean at times for various reasons including where tropical cyclones form there are several different ways to split the area between the american and african coasts for instance the  define three different basins for the tracking and warning of tropical cyclones these are the south-west indian ocean between the african coast and 90e the australian region between 90e and 160e and the south pacific between 160e and 120w the united states  also monitors the whole region but splits it at 135e into the south pacific and the southern indian ocean south-west indian ocean

the south-west indian ocean is located within the southern hemisphere between the africa s east coast and 90e and is primarily monitored by the meteo france s la reunion rsmc while the mauritian australian indonesian and malagasy weather services also monitor parts of it until the start of the 198586 tropical cyclone season the basin only extended to 80e with the 10 degrees between 80 and 90e considered to be a part of the australian region on average about 9 cyclones per develop into tropical storms while 5 of those go on to become tropical cyclones that are equivalent to a hurricane or a typhoon the tropical cyclones that form in this area can affect some of the various indian ocean island nations and or various countries along africa s east coast
