early forms of present-day hindustani developed from the    of present-day  in the 7th13th centuries  who lived in the 13th century ce during the  period in north india used these forms  which was the lingua franca of the period  in his writings and referred to it as hindavi the delhi sultanate which comprised several  and  dynasties that ruled from delhi was succeeded by the  in 1526 although the mughals were of   gurkn   descent they were  and persian had gradually become the state language of the mughal empire after  a continuation since the introduction of persian by   rulers in the indian subcontinent and the patronisation of it by the earlier turko-afghan delhi sultanate the basis in general for the introduction of persian language into the subcontinent was set from its earliest days by various persianised central asian turkic and afghan dynasties in the 18th century towards the end of the mughal period with the fragmentation of the empire and the elite system a variant of  one of the successors of apabhramsha vernaculars at  and nearby cities came to gradually replace persian as the lingua franca among the educated elite  particularly in northern india though persian still retained much of its pre-eminence for a short period the term hindustani  literally  of   was the name given to that variant of khariboli for socio-political reasons though essentially the variant of  with persian vocabulary the emerging  became also known as urdu  properly zabn-e urdu-e mo alla  language of the court  or zabn-e urdu      language of the camp  in persian derived from  ord  camp  cognate with english   due to its origin as the common speech of the mughal army  the more highly persianised version later established as a language of the court was called  or  mixed  as an emerging common dialect hindustani absorbed large numbers of persian arabic and turkic words and as mughal conquests grew it spread as a lingua franca across much of northern india written in the  or  it remained the primary lingua franca of northern india for the next four centuries  although it varied significantly in vocabulary depending on the local language  and achieved the status of a literary language alongside persian in muslim courts its development was centred on the poets of the mughal courts of cities in  such as delhi  and   in his book published in 1891 mentioned that the hindustani or camp language or language of the camps of  courts at  was not regarded by philologists as distinct language but only as a dialect of  with admixture of  he continued   but it has all the magnitude and importance of separate language it is linguistic result of muslim rule of eleventh   twelfth centuries and is spoken  except in rural    by many  in  and by  population in all parts of india  next to english it was the official language of  was commonly written in arabic or persian characters and was spoken by approximately 100,000,000 people when the british colonised the  from the late 18th through to the late 19th century they used the words  hindustani   hindi  and  urdu  interchangeably they developed it as the language of administration of  further preparing it to be the official language of modern india and pakistan however with independence use of the word  hindustani  declined being largely replaced by  hindi  and  urdu  or  hindi-urdu  when either of those was too specific more recently the word  hindustani  has been used for the colloquial language of  films which are popular in both india and pakistan and which cannot be unambiguously identified as either hindi or urdu registers

standard hindi one of the  is based on the  dialect of the delhi region and differs from urdu in that it is usually written in the indigenous  script of india and exhibits less persian and arabic influence than urdu many scholars today employ a sanskritised form of hindi developed primarily in  the  holy city which is based on the eastern hindi dialect of that region and thus a separate language from official standard hindi  it has a literature of 500 years with prose poetry religion   philosophy under the bahmani kings and later on khutab shahi adil shahi etc it is a living language still prevalent all over the  note that the term hindustani has generally fallen out of common usage in modern india except to refer to  indian  as a nationality and a style of indian  the term used to refer to it is hindi or urdu depending on the religion of the speaker and regardless of the mix of persian or sanskrit words used by the speaker one could conceive of a wide spectrum of dialects and registers with the highly persianised urdu at one end of the spectrum and a heavily sanskrit-based dialect spoken in the region around  at the other end of the spectrum in common usage in india the term hindi includes all these dialects except those at the urdu end of the spectrum thus the different meanings of the word hindi include among others 

standardised hindi as taught in schools throughout india  except some states such as tamil nadu  formal or official hindi advocated by  and as instituted by the post-independence indian government heavily influenced by sanskrit the vernacular dialects of hindustani as spoken throughout india the neutralised form of hindustani used in popular television and films or

in a specific sense hindustani may be used to refer to the dialects and varieties used in common speech in contrast with the standardised hindi and urdu this meaning is reflected in the use of the term  hindustani in other words the  language of the street or the marketplace  as opposed to the perceived refinement of formal hindi urdu or even sanskrit thus the webster s new world dictionary defines the term hindustani as the principal dialect of hindi urdu used as a trade language throughout north india and pakistan names 
 ca 1300 referred to this language of his writings as dahlavi  of delhi  or hindavi     of   during this period hindustani was used by  in promulgating their message across the  after the advent of the  in the subcontinent hindustani acquired more persian loanwords   mixture  and hindi  of  hindustan  became popular names for the same language until the 18th century the name urdu appeared around 1780 during the  the term hindustani was used by british officials in 1796  published a  a grammar of the hindoostanee language  upon  india and pakistan established national standards that they called hindi and urdu respectively and attempted to make distinct with the result that hindustani commonly but mistakenly came to be seen as a mixture of hindi and urdu  in his highly influential  proposed that the names hindustani urdu and hindi be separated in use for different varieties of the hindustani language rather than as the overlapping synonyms they frequently were 

we may now define the three main varieties of hindstn as follows hindstn is primarily the language of the upper gangetic doab and is also the lingua franca of india capable of being written in both persian and dva-ngar characters and without purism avoiding alike the excessive use of either persian or sanskrit words when employed for literature the name  urd  can then be confined to that special variety of hindstn in which persian words are of frequent occurrence and which hence can only be written in the persian character and similarly  hind  can be confined to the form of hindstn in which sanskrit words abound and which hence can only be written in the dva-ngar character

historically hindustani was written in the   and  kaithi and devanagari are two of the  native to india whereas urdu is a derivation of the  script  which is preferred calligraphic style for  today hindustani continues to be written in the urdu alphabet and this is nearly exclusive in pakistan in india the hindi register is officially written in   a relative of kaithi  and urdu in  script  to the extent that these standards are partly defined by their script however in popular publications in india urdu is also written in devanagari script with slight variations to establish a devanagari urdu alphabet alongside the devanagari hindi alphabet 

because of  in south asia and the international use of the  hindustani is occasionally written in the latin script this adaptation is called  or romanised hindi depending upon the register used because the bollywood film industry is a major proponent of the latin script the use of latin script to write in hindi and urdu is growing amongst younger internet users  since urdu and hindi are  when spoken romanised hindi and roman urdu  unlike devanagari hindi and urdu in the urdu alphabet  are mutually intelligible as well sample text
