comparison between extratropical and tropical cyclones on surface analysis


there are a number of structural characteristics common to all cyclones a cyclone is a  a cyclone s center  often known in a mature tropical cyclone as the   is the area of lowest atmospheric pressure in the region near the center the   from the pressure in the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone  and the  from the  must be in an approximate balance or the cyclone would collapse on itself as a result of the difference in pressure because of the  the wind flow around a large cyclone is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere in the northern hemisphere the fastest winds relative to the surface of the earth therefore occur on the eastern side of a northward-moving cyclone and on the northern side of a westward-moving one  the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere in contrast to low pressure systems the wind flow around high pressure systems are clockwise   in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere formation




the initial extratropical low-pressure area forms at the location of the red dot on the image it is usually perpendicular  at a right angle to  the leaf-like cloud formation seen on satellite during the early stage of cyclogenesis the location of the axis of the upper level  is in light blue 





tropical cyclones form when the energy released by the condensation of moisture in rising air causes a  over warm ocean waters

cyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in the development of some sort of cyclone it can occur at various scales from the microscale to the synoptic scale extratropical cyclones begin as waves along  before occluding later in their life cycle as cold-core systems however some intense extratropical cyclones can become warm-core systems when a  occurs tropical cyclones form as a result of significant convective activity and are warm core mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land and can lead to tornado formation  can also form from mesocyclones but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical  cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis and is the high-pressure system equivalent which deals with the formation of  a surface low can form in a variety of ways topography can create a surface low  can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core the disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the  and the low is positioned at the crest around the low the flow becomes cyclonic this rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator on the west side of the low while warm air move towards the pole on the east side a cold front appears on the west side while a warm front forms on the east side usually the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and  catches up  with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone in addition the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure denser cold air mass the cold front over takes the warm front and reduces the length of the warm front at this point an  forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft which is also known as a  tropical cyclogenesis is the term that describes the development and strengthening of a  the mechanisms by which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those that produce mid cyclones tropical cyclogenesis the development of a  cyclone begins with significant  in a favorable atmospheric environment there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis

 summary map


a tropical cyclone is a  characterized by a  center and numerous  that produce strong winds and   a tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist  rises resulting in  of  contained in the moist air they are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as   and  leading to their classification as  warm core  storm systems 



 a rare  viewed from the  on march 26 2004


the term  tropical  refers to both the geographic origin of these systems which form almost exclusively in  regions of the globe and their dependence on  for their formation the term  cyclone  refers to the storms  cyclonic nature with  rotation in the  and clockwise rotation in the  depending on their location and strength tropical cyclones are referred to by other names such as hurricane  tropical storm cyclonic storm tropical depression or simply as a cyclone while tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential  they are also able to produce high waves and a damaging  their winds increase the wave size and in so doing they draw more heat and moisture into their system thereby increasing their strength they develop over large bodies of warm water and hence lose their strength if they move over land this is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone while inland regions are relatively safe from strong winds heavy rains however can produce significant flooding inland storm surges are rises in sea level caused by the reduced pressure of the core that in effect  sucks  the water upward and from winds that in effect  pile  the water up storm surges can produce extensive coastal  up to 40 kilometres  25mi  from the coastline although their effects on human populations can be devastating tropical cyclones can also relieve  conditions they also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward   which makes them an important part of the global  mechanism as a result tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the earth s  many tropical cyclones  when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable others form when  acquire tropical characteristics tropical systems are then moved by  in the   if the conditions remain favorable the tropical disturbance intensifies and can even develop an  on the other end of the spectrum if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall the system weakens and eventually dissipates a tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition 









































upper level types
polar cyclone
main article  
a polar sub-polar or arctic cyclone  also known as a   is a vast area of low pressure that strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer a polar cyclone is a low-pressure  usually spanning 1,000 kilometres  620mi  to 2,000 kilometres  1,200mi  in which the air circulates in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere and a clockwise direction in the southern hemisphere the coriolis acceleration acting on the air masses moving poleward at high altitude causes a counterclockwise circulation at high altitude the poleward movement of air originates from the air circulation of the  the polar low is not driven by convection as are tropical cyclones nor the cold and warm air mass interactions as are extratropical cyclones but is an artifact of the global air movement of the polar cell the base of the polar low is in the mid to upper troposphere in the northern hemisphere the polar cyclone has two centers on average one center lies near baffin island and the other over northeast siberia in the southern hemisphere it tends to be located near the edge of the  near 160 west longitude when the polar vortex is strong its effect can be felt at the surface as a westerly wind  toward the east  when the polar cyclone is weak significant cold outbreaks occur tutt cell
main article  
under specific circumstances upper level cold lows can break off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough  tutt  which is located mid-ocean in the northern hemisphere during the summer months these upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices also known as tutt cells or tutt lows usually move slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest and their bases generally do not extend below 20,000 feet  6,100m  in altitude a weak inverted surface trough within the  is generally found underneath them and they may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds downward development results in an increase of  and the appearance of a surface vortex in rare cases they become warm-core  upper cyclones and the upper troughs that trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance cyclone mesoscale
the following types of cyclones are not identifiable in synoptic charts mesocyclone
main article  
a mesocyclone is a  of air 2.0 kilometres  1.2mi  to 10 kilometres  6.2mi  in diameter  the   within a   air rises and rotates around a vertical axis usually in the same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere they are most often cyclonic that is associated with a localized low-pressure region within a  such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe  mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in  where  may form about 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the  but only half produce tornadoes tornado
main article  
a tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or in rare cases the base of a cumulus cloud also referred to as twisters a collequial term in america or cyclones although the word cyclone is used in meteorology in a wider sense to name any closed low-pressure circulation dust devil
