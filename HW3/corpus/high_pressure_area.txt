a high-pressure area high or anticyclone is a region where the  at the surface of the planet is greater than its surrounding environment winds within high-pressure areas flow outward from the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement because the higher pressure compresses the column of air near the center of the area into greater density  and so greater weight compared to lower pressure lower density and lower weight of the air outside the center however because the planet is rotating underneath the atmosphere and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it the air flow from center to periphery is not direct but is twisted due to the  or the merely apparent  that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference viewed from above this twist in wind direction is in the same direction as the rotation of the planet the strongest high-pressure areas are associated with cold air masses which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less sun to warm neighboring regions these highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodies somewhat weaker but more common are high-pressure areas caused by atmospheric subsidence that is areas where large masses of cooler drier air descend from an elevation of 8 to 15km after the lower temperatures have precipitated out the water vapor many of the features of highs may be understood in context of middle or  and relatively enduring dynamics of a planet s  for example massive atmospheric subsidences occur as part of the descending branches of  and  hadley cells help form the  steer  and  across the ocean and is strongest during the summer the subtropical ridge also helps form most of the world s  on   high-pressure centers are identified by the letter h weather maps in other languages may use different letters or symbols

wind circulation in the northern and southern hemispheres 
the direction of wind flow around an atmospheric high-pressure area and a  as seen from above depends on the hemisphere high-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere  low-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere the scientific terms in english used to describe the weather systems generated by highs and lows were introduced in the mid-1800s mostly by the british the scientific theories which explain the general phenomena originated about two centuries earlier the term  was coined by  of the british east india company to describe the devastating storm of december 1789 in coringa india a cyclone forms around a low-pressure area  the term for the kind of weather around a high-pressure area was coined in 1877 by  to indicate an area whose winds revolved in the opposite direction of a  in british english the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise making the label anticyclones a logical extension a simple rule of thumb is that for high-pressure areas where generally air flows from the center outward the  given by the earth s rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth s apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere s pole so both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern the opposite to these two cases occurs in the case of a high these results derive from the   that article explains in detail the physics and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding formation

the letter  is used to represent a high-pressure area 

strong vertically shallow high-pressure systems moving from higher latitudes to lower latitudes in the northern hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses once arctic air moves over an unfrozen ocean the air mass modifies greatly over the warmer water and takes on the character of a maritime air mass which reduces the strength of the high-pressure system when extremely cold air moves over relatively warm oceans  can develop however warm and moist  or maritime tropical  air masses that move poleward from tropical sources are slower to modify than arctic air masses in climatology
