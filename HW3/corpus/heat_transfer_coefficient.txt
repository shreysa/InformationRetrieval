it is to be noted that often the value for  is referred to as the difference of two radii where the inner and outer radii are used to define the thickness of a pipe carrying a fluid however this figure may also be considered as a wall thickness in a flat plate transfer mechanism or other common flat surfaces such as a wall in a building when the area difference between each edge of the transmission surface approaches zero in the walls of buildings the above formula can be used to derive the formula commonly used to calculate the heat through building components architects and engineers call the resulting values either the  or the  of a construction assembly like a wall each type of value  r or u  are related as the inverse of each other such that r-value   1 u-value and both are more fully understood through the concept of an  described in lower section of this document convective heat transfer correlations 
although convective heat transfer can be derived analytically through dimensional analysis exact analysis of the boundary layer approximate integral analysis of the boundary layer and analogies between energy and momentum transfer these analytic approaches may not offer practical solutions to all problems when there are no mathematical models applicable therefore many correlations were developed by various authors to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient in various cases including natural convection forced convection for internal flow and forced convection for external flow these empirical correlations are presented for their particular geometry and flow conditions as the fluid properties are temperature dependent they are evaluated at the   which is the average of the surface  and the surrounding bulk temperature  


external flow vertical plane 
recommendations by churchill and chu provide the following correlation for natural convection adjacent to a vertical plane both for laminar and turbulent flow k is the  of the fluid l is the  with respect to the direction of gravity ral is the  with respect to this length and pr is the  


for laminar flows the following correlation is slightly more accurate it is observed that a transition from a laminar to a turbulent boundary occurs when ral exceeds around 109 


external flow vertical cylinders 
for cylinders with their axes vertical the expressions for plane surfaces can be used provided the curvature effect is not too significant this represents the limit where boundary layer thickness is small relative to cylinder diameter  the correlations for vertical plane walls can be used when



where  is the  external flow horizontal plates 
w h mcadams suggested the following correlations for horizontal plates the induced buoyancy will be different depending upon whether the hot surface is facing up or down for a hot surface facing up or a cold surface facing down for laminar flow 



and for turbulent flow 



for a hot surface facing down or a cold surface facing up for laminar flow 



the characteristic length is the ratio of the plate surface area to perimeter if the surface is inclined at an angle  with the vertical then the equations for a vertical plate by churchill and chu may be used for  up to 60  if the boundary layer flow is laminar the gravitational constant g is replaced with g cos when calculating the ra term external flow horizontal cylinder 
for cylinders of sufficient length and negligible end effects churchill and chu has the following correlation for

the dittus-blter correlation  1930  is a common and particularly simple correlation useful for many applications this correlation is applicable when forced convection is the only mode of heat transfer  i.e there is no boiling condensation significant radiation etc the accuracy of this correlation is anticipated to be 15 for a fluid flowing in a straight circular pipe with a  between 10,000 and 120,000  in the  pipe flow range  when the fluid s  is between 0.7 and 120 for a location far from the pipe entrance  more than 10 pipe diameters  more than 50 diameters according to many authors  or other flow disturbances and when the pipe surface is hydraulically smooth the heat transfer coefficient between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface can be expressed explicitly as

the fluid properties necessary for the application of this equation are evaluated at the  thus avoiding iteration
forced convection external flow 
in analyzing the heat transfer associated with the flow past the exterior surface of a solid the situation is complicated by phenomena such as boundary layer separation various authors have correlated charts and graphs for different geometries and flow conditions for flow parallel to a plane surface where  is the distance from the edge and  is the height of the boundary layer a mean nusselt number can be calculated using the colburn analogy thom correlation 
there exist simple fluid-specific correlations for heat transfer coefficient in boiling the thom correlation is for the flow of boiling water  subcooled or saturated at pressures up to about 20 mpa  under conditions where the nucleate boiling contribution predominates over forced convection this correlation is useful for rough estimation of expected temperature difference given the heat flux 

where 

 is the wall temperature elevation above the saturation temperature k
q is the heat flux mw m2
p is the pressure of water mpa

note that this empirical correlation is specific to the units given heat transfer coefficient of pipe wall 
the resistance to the flow of heat by the material of pipe wall can be expressed as a  heat transfer coefficient of the pipe wall  however one needs to select if the heat flux is based on the pipe inner or the outer diameter selecting to base the  on the pipe inner diameter and assuming that the pipe wall thickness is small in comparison with the pipe inner diameter then the heat transfer coefficient for the pipe wall can be calculated as if the wall were not curved 



where k is the effective  of the wall material and x is the wall thickness if the above assumption does not hold then the wall heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using the following expression 



where di and do are the inner and outer diameters of the pipe respectively the thermal conductivity of the tube material usually depends on temperature  the mean thermal conductivity is often used combining heat transfer coefficients 
for two or more heat transfer processes acting in parallel heat transfer coefficients simply add 



for two or more heat transfer processes connected in series heat transfer coefficients add inversely 



for example consider a pipe with a fluid flowing inside the approximate rate of heat transfer between the bulk of the fluid inside the pipe and the pipe external surface is

   difference in temperature 
overall heat transfer coefficient 
the overall heat transfer coefficient  is a measure of the overall ability of a series of conductive and convective barriers to transfer heat it is commonly applied to the calculation of heat transfer in  but can be applied equally well to other problems for the case of a heat exchanger  can be used to determine the total heat transfer between the two streams in the heat exchanger by the following relationship 



where 

   heat transfer rate  w 
   overall heat transfer coefficient  w mk 
   heat transfer surface area  m2 
     k  
the overall heat transfer coefficient takes into account the individual heat transfer coefficients of each stream and the resistance of the pipe material it can be calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of a series of thermal resistances  but more complex relationships exist for example when heat transfer takes place by different routes in parallel 



where 

r   resistance s  to heat flow in pipe wall  k w 
other parameters are as above 
the heat transfer coefficient is the heat transferred per unit area per kelvin thus area is included in the equation as it represents the area over which the transfer of heat takes place the areas for each flow will be different as they represent the contact area for each fluid side the  due to the pipe wall is calculated by the following relationship 



where

x   the wall thickness  m 
k   the thermal conductivity of the material  w mk 
a   the total area of the heat exchanger  m2 

this represents the heat transfer by conduction in the pipe the  is a characteristic of the particular material values of thermal conductivities for various materials are listed in the  as mentioned earlier in the article the convection heat transfer coefficient for each stream depends on the type of fluid flow properties and temperature properties some typical heat transfer coefficients include 

air  h   10 to 100 w m2k 
water  h   500 to 10,000 w m2k  
thermal resistance due to fouling deposits 
often during their use heat exchangers collect a layer of fouling on the surface which in addition to potentially contaminating a stream reduces the effectiveness of heat exchangers in a fouled heat exchanger the buildup on the walls creates an additional layer of materials that heat must flow through due to this new layer there is additional resistance within the heat exchanger and thus the overall heat transfer coefficient of the exchanger is reduced the following relationship is used to solve for the heat transfer resistance with the additional fouling resistance 

   

where

   overall heat transfer coefficient for a fouled heat exchanger 
  perimeter of the heat exchanger may be either the hot or cold side perimeter however it must be the same perimeter on both sides of the equation 
   overall heat transfer coefficient for an unfouled heat exchanger 
   fouling resistance on the cold side of the heat exchanger 
   fouling resistance on the hot side of the heat exchanger 
   perimeter of the cold side of the heat exchanger 


   perimeter of the hot side of the heat exchanger 

this equation uses the overall heat transfer coefficient of an unfouled heat exchanger and the fouling resistance to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient of a fouled heat exchanger the equation takes into account that the perimeter of the heat exchanger is different on the hot and cold sides the perimeter used for the  does not matter as long as it is the same the overall heat transfer coefficients will adjust to take into account that a different perimeter was used as the product  will remain the same the fouling resistances can be calculated for a specific heat exchanger if the average thickness and thermal conductivity of the fouling are known the product of the average thickness and thermal conductivity will result in the fouling resistance on a specific side of the heat exchanger
