a more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent by the 1980s prior to the development of atcf the tools used by the department of defense to forecast tropical cyclone track were acetate grease pencils and disparate computer programs the atcf software was developed by the  for the jtwc beginning in 1986 and used since 1988 it was adapted for use at the   nhc  in 1990 jtwc adheres to the   wmo  rules for storm names and adheres to acknowledged guidelines for intensity of  and  with the exception of using the u.s standard of measuring sustained winds for 1-min instead of the 10-min span recommended by the wmo  see   the jtwc is not one of the wmo designated  nor one of its  as its main mission is to support the  government agencies jtwc monitors analyzes and forecasts tropical cyclone formation development and movement year round its area of responsibility covers 89 of the world s tropical cyclone activity staffing 
the center is manned by about 37  and  personnel the jtwc uses several satellite systems and sensors radar surface and upper level synoptic data as well as atmospheric models to complete its mission see also
