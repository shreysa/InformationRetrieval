a disturbance formed south of  on 29 february and    mfr  upgraded the identified system within the  to a tropical disturbance on the next day on 2 march although the centre was exposed due to moderate easterly vertical  the   jtwc  issued a  on the system which was situated north of a  based on improved organisation of deep convection and moderate poleward  however its temporary acceleration on that day lessened vertical wind shear as the centre became under organised deep convection on 3 march the system intensified into a tropical depression then a moderate tropical storm named gafilo by the sub-regional tropical cyclone advisory centre in  shortly before mfr even upgraded gafilo to a severe tropical storm later when the system slowed down and tracked west-northwestwards along the northern periphery of a building  it reached category 1 strength on the  late on 3 march the complete pattern of the cyclone from march 4 to march 8 as it moved through the south western indian ocean has been recorded by the trmm through its satellite imagery trmm  tropical rainfall measuring mission  is a joint mission between nasa and the japanese space agency jaxa 



tropical cyclone gafilo on 3 march


although dry air significantly reduced deep convection on 4 march mfr upgraded gafilo to a tropical cyclone because of a banding  when the system began to expand its clockwise circulation and track west-southwestwards by dual  channels gafilo underwent  and reached category 4 strength on the  on 5 march as mfr also upgraded gafilo to an intense tropical cyclone late on the same day on 6 march besides warm  above 29c the atypical third outflow channel from the west made conditions for the cyclone more favourable therefore mfr upgraded gafilo to a very intense tropical cyclone with a very well-defined circular and warm 20 nautical miles  37km  23mi  diameter eye at 06z when it also reached category 5 strength on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale at 12z gafilo attained its peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 125 knots  230km h 145mph  and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to 895hpa  26.4inhg  although microwave imagery showed that the  had begun shortly after slightly weakening due to land interaction gafilo made landfall in the vicinity of   early on 7 march unlike other storms the overland depression just weakened gradually because of its unusually large circulation making the outer part still at sea on that day gafilo tracked more southwestwards along the northwestern periphery of a  located to the southeast before noon on 8 march gafilo arrived at the  as a moderate tropical storm whose strongest winds were located in the northern sector on 9 march gafilo became almost stationary and then tracked southeastwards along the western periphery of a  located to the east mfr upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm supported by observed data from malagasy stations at noon  however jtwc analysed that the storm became below category 1 strength on the  at the same time in their best track data late on 9 march gafilo made landfall north of   and the system started to make a three-day clockwise loop over the south part of madagascar for the system further weakened after landfall jtwc analysed that gafilo dissipated overland late on 11 march as well as mfr issued a final warning on the overland depression which began to track southeastwards early on 12 march surprisingly mfr began to issue warnings again on the completely disorganised system at noon on 12 march as the residual centre was expected to go back overseas late on the same day jtwc issued a  on the overland remnants because of improved deep convection over the low-level circulation centre poleward  and weak vertical  early on 13 march gafilo arrived at the  as a tropical disturbance  jtwc cancelled a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system because of the less organised low-level circulation centre and moderate vertical wind shear gafilo transferred into a  south of  on 14 march when the deep convective activity was intensifying with better organisation of a small cluster above the low-level circulation centre due to good upper-level divergence and a warm  of 26c to 29c after attaining minor peak intensity in its subtropical period late on 14 march gafilo began to track eastward and transitioned into an  on 15 march owing to a building  located to the southwest the extratropical depression slowed down and turned northwestwards on 16 march after slowly weakening the system completely dissipated on 18 march impact

gafilo caused strong winds and torrential rainfall over  a half of day after the first landfall  winds were still observed near  late on 7 march when gafilo was reorganising in the  190mm  7.5in  of  was recorded at  on 9 march as well as 242mm  9.5in  was recorded at  on the same day during its three-day loop overland gafilo brought 238mm  9.4in  at  on 11 march as  has already struck madagascar one month ago damage from gafilo became extremely devastating in the country the national rescue council in  reported 237 dead 181 missing 879 injured and 304,000 homeless  among which 174,000 in  alone  more than 20,000 homes were destroyed as well as 413 public buildings and 3,400 schools were damaged including 1,400 completely destroyed ones the  estimated that there were 700,000 disaster-stricken 280,000 of which needed urgent assistance despite being located 300km  190mi  north of gafilos centre the shipwreck of the ferry samson still happened at night on 7 march offshore the northwestern port of  a narrow but strong band of gafilo caused very rough conditions at sea making the ferry undergo an engine failure and tip over almost instantaneously while the number of fatalities remains undetermined  120 people were officially onboard  only three people drifted ran aground and survived from the shipwreck.the ferry was heading to madagascar from the coromos islands in antalaha food prices shot up by 35 and the harbour was badly damaged and not operational roads and bridges connecting the city to the outlying villages were inaccessible as well as electricity water and telephone lines were cut overall in madagascar the main damage caused by gafilo was the subsequent flooding of vast areas in the north northwest and southwest where extensive the flooding had caused serious damage to  rice and banana crops in many places the crops were expected to be totally lost moreover  harvesting also suffered some of the concerned areas coincided with those affected by  and stocks and resources had therefore been depleted in many areas in the absence of immediate response an increase in water borne diseases such as  and  could have had an immediate occurrence while outbreaks of  were expected to be witnessed within the coming 68 weeks other islands 
damage was minimal to other islands in the south-west indian ocean but  was very heavy far from the centre of gafilo 393mm  15.5in  was recorded at  within 48 hours and 159mm  6.3in  was recorded at  on 4 march situated 160km  99mi  south of gafilo ten-minute maximum sustained winds were 49 knots with a peak gust of 66 knots recorded at  during 7 and 8 march precipitation at  was recorded between 100 and 275mm  3.9 and 10.8in  aftermath 
following the passage of gafilo the malagasy government passed inter-ministerial order 17939 2004 in september 2004 which cleared the way for export of new and existing stocks of  as salvage this created anarchy in the national parks in the  with loggers extracting a large amounts of rosewood and  grossly disproportionate to the amount of damage caused by the storm during this time  reported that with the granting of export rights logging in the park had resumed it was not until 2006 with the passing of inter-ministerial order 16030 2006 that the export ban was reinstated nearly two years after the storm but not before the exporters lobbied the government for an extension following the grievances expressed by operators in october 2005 per memorandum 923 05 exports were also authorized following cyclones in 2006 and 2007 encouraging the stockpiling of large quantities of lumber in both legal depots and hidden caches around the ports of  and  records
