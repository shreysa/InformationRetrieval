while trekking across the central caribbean sea janet was only slightly larger than while it was moving over the windward islands with gale force winds extending 125mi  200km  out from the center by september25 remaining a category4 hurricane as it moved erratically westward across the caribbean a reconnaissance flight mission during the night of september2526 indicated strong rainbands with frequent  strikes and a well-defined eye evidence that the storm was once again rapidly intensifying as it neared the  on september26 janet began accelerating in forward speed after the reconnaissance flight snowcloud five was lost while making a penetration into the hurricane s eye another flight early on september27 reported a minimum pressure of 938mbar  hpa  27.70inhg  with winds in excess of 115mph  185km h   by a large and incalculable amount  the hurricane was estimated to have intensified to  intensitythe highest rating on the modern day at 1200utc on september27 while in the western caribbean sea janet continued to intensify afterwards eventually reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 175mph  280km h  with gale force winds having expanded to at least 250mi  400km  away from the center of the hurricane janet maintained peak intensity as it passed over the  before making  in extreme southern quintana roo mexico just east of  in that city a  indicated a minimum barometric pressure of 914mbar  hpa  27.00inhg  in the eye of janet at the time this was the second lowest pressure ever recorded on land in a landfalling  behind the  though janet was later surpassed by hurricanes  and  which also made landfall on the yucatn peninsula as category5 hurricanes once over land janet considerably weakened to a  with winds of 105mph  170km h  after crossing the yucatn peninsula with a forward speed of 21mph  34km h  the hurricane emerged into the  by 1600utc on september28 the weakened hurricane marginally intensified as it crossed the bay of campeche to a secondary peak intensity of 110mph  175km h  with a minimum central pressure of 950mbar  hpa  28.06inhg  janet eventually made its final landfall 50mi  80km  north of the city of  by 2200utc on september29 as a category2 hurricane after moving inland the hurricane became quickly disorganized due to the highly mountainous terrain of  and as a result the weather bureau issued its last advisory on janet the weakening system degenerated to tropical storm strength by september30 and later dissipated over central mexico by 0600utc that day janet s remnant circulation contributed to the development of a disturbed area of weather off the western coast of mexico that would subsequently develop into a  on october1 
preparations
upon janet s formation east of the windward islands the weather bureau office in  advised  to remain in port and vessels in the path of the developing storm to exercise caution after a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested  were issued at 1600utc on september22 for the entirety of the lesser antilles from  to grenada including barbados  were issued for all islands in the windward islands from saint lucia south to  excluding  all warnings in the windward antilles remained in effect until 1000utc on september22 shortly after warnings were lowered in the windward islands storm warnings were issued for the  and the  of  at 0200utc on september23 after janet passed north of the islands all storm warnings were lifted on the morning of september25 the weather bureau later warned interests in jamaica but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the island yucatn peninsula and mexico 
the weather bureau first began cautioning areas of  at 1600utc on september26 advising people in areas of northeast  and  to take precautionary measures along with all vessels and small craft in the  south to  after janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest advisories warned areas in  and  of hurricane-related impacts though no official warnings were issued for areas of central america advisories published by the weather bureau cautioned interests in the hurricane s path up until landfall evacuations took place in several coastal towns in quintana roo upon notification of the oncoming storm people were evacuated to inland hillside shelters after the hurricane moved through the yucatn peninsula and entered the bay of campeche the weather bureau alerted areas in the storm s path on the western side of mexico s gulf coast at the time janet was expected to make landfall between veracruz and  areas were warned of the storm s potential flooding and coastal impacts the weather bureau advised all small craft south of  to remain in port notifications of janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfall impact 

during its existence areas of the  abc islands and central america were affected by janet at least  65.8million in damages and 1,023deaths were caused by the hurricane mostly in quintana roo the large number of deaths and damage caused by janet helped make the 1955atlantic hurricane season the deadliest and costliest hurricane season documented since comprehensive record of such statistics began in 1942 lesser antilles 
as a small but rapidly intensifying hurricane janet passed just south of barbados on september22 becoming the first hurricane to strike the island in 57years since the  maximum sustained winds on the south side of the island were estimated to be between 110120mph  180190km h  the strong winds knocked out communication lines preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and  electric power was later restored allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm  the island country s main source of revenue was severely damaged with losses estimated to be in excess of  1million poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds an estimated 8,100homes were damaged by the hurricane the destroyed buildings and trees blocked  and the  was forced to close heavy rains peaked at 4in  100mm  and a  of 7ft  2.1m  swept away low-lying houses along the coast an estimated 2,000people were left homeless due to the hurricane property damage on barbados was estimated to be  5million and at least 57people were killed on september23 janet passed directly between grenada and carriacou in the  killing 122people in the  an  on grenada was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds eight people were killed in a small town adjacent to the airport strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses and unroofed a hotel in  houses were also unroofed and  of government offices in st george s were torn off all bridges in the island s interior regions collapsed and spice crops sustained heavy damage an estimated 75 of  plantations were destroyed along with nearly all of the island s banana and  crops three ships were also grounded in the local harbor in the carenage the waterfront region of st george s debris was scattered and an 820ft  250m   collapsed  was mostly destroyed and st lucia suffered significant coastal damage over  2.8million in damages were estimated throughout the grenadines farther south in  a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed killing ten people hurricane janet skirted the  with strong winds as it passed to the north from september2425 in  gusts peaked at 50mph  80km h  uprooting trees however damage outside of trees was primarily insignificant in  piers were destroyed and the island s coastal boulevard was damaged beach facilities at  s piscadera and vaersen bays suffered considerable damage quays along the harbor entrance were also damaged snowcloud five 
on september26 the   aircraft snowcloud five led by u.s navy  grover b windham was sent from  to investigate janet which was at the time a category4 hurricane south of  upon penetration of the hurricane s eyewall at an altitude of 700ft  200m  a final transmission was received from the reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in the caribbean sea all 11people on board including nine crew members and two journalists were killed following the loss of the plane an extensive  operation took place over a large area of the caribbean sea with 3,000personnel involved with the search returning no results the exact cause of the crash remains unknown though it is speculated that the plane s  gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943 snowcloud five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft as a result of a hurricane in the atlantic basin with the other three occurring as a result of  yucatn peninsula

as it approached the yucatn peninsula janet passed over the swan islands north of honduras as a category5 hurricane on september27 the hurricane caused rough seas and strong winds uprooted trees and  after gusts exceeded an estimated 100mph  160km h  officials on the islands took shelter in a navy  though no deaths were reported janet destroyed almost all buildings on the islands the u.s weather bureau and  requested food and supplies for 82people on the island after the storm passed quintana roo 
after passing the swan islands janet made landfall on the yucatn peninsula between corozal town british honduras and chetumal mexico at 1700utc on september28 at the time it had winds of 175mph  280km h   winds were reported for two hours preceding the hurricane s landfall with numerous pressure readings below 948mbar  hpa  28.00inhg  roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due to janet in  the strong winds from janet flattened the port s infrastructure and only one house remained intact after the storm s passage 97people were killed in xcalak constituting more than a third of the port s population chetumal mexico was devastated with only four buildings left standing storm surge pushed water to a depth of 6.5feet  2m  1600ft  490m  inland despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean the death toll in chetumal remains uncertain  120bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found an additional 10,000people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane and were forced to sleep in the open overnight federal  previously providing service for areas affected by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the  were ordered to extend relief operations to the yucatn peninsula in quintana roo hurricane janet was estimated to have caused  40million in damages and at least 500deaths the most of any region affected by janet british honduras 
making landfall near the border between mexico and british honduras the latter colony s  and   containing a population of 15,500at the time experienced severe devastation from janet strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across british honduras particularly in the freshwater creek forest preserve there an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged especially  and  trees hurricane janet also caused extensive damage to crops with an estimated  2.631million in damages   and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage sugar cane was expected to have a 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm  crops and  experienced less significant losses to a lesser extent the hurricane also affected the  and several of british honduras  offshore  similar to corozal and orange walk districts corn trees and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop in  south of where janet made landfall 500people were made homeless and six people were killed about 90%of all buildings in the town were destroyed and communications were knocked out by the strong winds based on an average home cost of  2,000 it was estimated that property damage to homes in corozal town totaled  800,000 much of  was also flattened by the strong winds farther south in  winds peaked at 60mph  100km h  though no damage was reported in british honduras the hurricane s effects were less deadly than in quintana roo but in northern portions of the colony the storm killed 16people and caused  5million in damages mainland mexico
