storm surge considerations 
waves along coastal areas can destroy a building buildings should preferably be built on high ground in order to avoid waves if waves can reach the building site the building ought to be elevated on steel concrete or wooden pilings or anchored to solid rock wind loading considerations




a  in  after  in 2005


wind acting on the roof surfaces of a building can cause negative pressures that create a lifting force sufficient to lift the roof off the building once this occurs the building is weakened considerably and the rest of the building will likely fail as well to minimize this vulnerability the upper structure ought to be anchored through the walls to the foundation several methods can be used to anchor the roof typically roof trusses are  toenailed  into the top of the walls which provide insufficient force to resist high winds  nail into the wall and wrap over the trusses provide higher force resistance mobile home tie down to the foundation 
interlocking metal pan roof systems installed on mobile homes can fail under the pressure differential  lift  created by the high velocity winds passing over the surface plane of the roof this is compounded by the wind entering the building allowing the building interior to pressurize lifting the underside of the roof panels resulting in destruction of the building one example of pan roof systems can be found in this document from  to mitigate this pressure differential pre-installed aluminum tabular channels can permanently be fastened perpendicularly across the top of the interlocking ribs of the metal roof system without disturbing the flow of rainwater at the eaves mid-span and ridge locations of the building earth-sheltering 
 construction is generally more resistant to strong winds and tornadoes than standard construction cellars and other earth sheltered components of other buildings can provide safe refuge during tornadoes dome homes

the physical geometry of a building affects its aerodynamic properties and how well it can withstand a storm geodesic dome roofs or buildings have low drag coefficients and can withstand higher wind forces than a square building of the same area even stronger buildings result from  construction building components 
building openings such as garage doors and windows are often weak points susceptible to failure by wind pressure and blowing debris once failure occurs wind pressure builds up inside the building resulting in the roof lifting off the building  can provide protection doors can be blown into the house by wind causing potential   see   windows can be constructed with plastic panes shatterproof glass or glass with protective membranes the panes are often more firmly attached than normal window panes including using screws or bolts through the edges of larger panes tapcons are used to fasten windows with the concrete structure surrounding wood has a relatively high degree of flexibility which can be beneficial under certain building stresses  is a strong dense material that if used in a building that is designed properly can withstand the destructive power of very high winds and high-speed debris regulation 
after  in 1992 caused  16 billion in insured damage the state of  established new building standards and enforcement the state increased performance criteria for wind-load provisions and adopted new wind provisions from the  one important addition included with the new code was the requirement of  which can withstand high velocity impact from wind-borne debris during a hurricane many houses built in south florida since hurricane andrew are  construction reinforced with concrete pillars  and codes requirements for  and types of roofing florida also designated high velocity hurricane zones  i.e high velocity hurricane zone  with special requirements defined for  and  counties hong kong requires many structures to withstand winds from typhoons examples of cyclonic construction methods
