a mature tropical cyclone can release heat at a rate upwards of 6x1014  tropical cyclones on the open sea cause large waves heavy rain and high winds disrupting international shipping and at times causing  generally after its passage a tropical cyclone stirs up ocean water lowering  behind it this cool wake can cause the region to be less favorable for a subsequent tropical cyclone on rare occasions tropical cyclones may actually do the opposite  s  blew warm water behind it contributing to the unprecedented intensity of  which followed it closely hurricanes help to maintain the global heat balance by moving warm moist tropical air to the mid-latitudes and polar regions were it not for the movement of heat poleward  through other means as well as hurricanes  the tropical regions would be unbearably hot north american colonization 
shipwrecks are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones such shipwrecks can change the course of history as well as influence art and literature a hurricane led to a victory of the spanish over the french for control of fort caroline and ultimately the atlantic coast of north america in 1565 the  was wrecked near bermuda in 1609 which led to the colonization of bermuda and provided the inspiration for   shipping 




the dangerous semicircle is the upper-right corner with the arrow marking the direction of motion of a northern hemisphere storm note that typhoons etc are asymmetrical and semicircle is a convenient misnomer 

mariners have a way to safely navigate around tropical cyclones they split tropical cyclones in two based on their direction of motion and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the northern hemisphere  the left in the southern hemisphere  sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm as the cyclone s translation speed and its rotational wind are additive the other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened  subtractive  in this portion of the storm  but are still potentially quite hazardous  the rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path  crossing the t  those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the  bow and make as much headway as possible ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible upon landfall

although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the  regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions hurricanes in the eastern north pacific often supply moisture to the  and parts of mexico  receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons  averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path though it also killed 259people and caused  9.14billion  2005   in damage on the other hand the occurrence of tropical cyclones can cause tremendous variability in rainfall over the areas they affect  indeed cyclones are the primary cause of the most extreme rainfall variability in the world observed in places such as  and  in subtropical  where the annual rainfall can range from practically nothing with no cyclones to over 1,000 millimetres  39in  if cyclones are abundant tornadoes

the broad rotation of a land falling tropical cyclone often spawns  particularly in their right front quadrant while these tornadoes are normally not as strong as their non-tropical counterparts heavy damage or loss of life can still occur tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of  which persist until landfall deaths 

during the last two centuries tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about 1.9million people worldwide it is estimated that 10,000people per year perish due to tropical cyclones the deadliest tropical cyclone was the  which had a death toll of anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 lives united states 
before  the average death rate for tropical cyclones in the united states was decreasing the main cause of storm-related fatalities was shifting away from storm surge and towards freshwater flooding however the  death rate per storm had increased through 1979 with a lull during the 19801995 period this was due to greater numbers of people moving to the coastal margins and into harm s way despite advances in warning strategies and reduction in track forecast error this increase in fatalities is expected to continue for as long as people migrate towards the shore reconstruction and repopulation

while tropical cyclones may well seriously damage settlement total destruction encourages rebuilding for example the destruction wrought by  on the gulf coast spurred redevelopment greatly increasing local property values research indicates that the typical hurricane strike raises real house prices for a number of years with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence however disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms  is the most obvious example as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after hurricane camille many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well in isolated areas with small populations tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties to contribute to the  as survivors repopulate their place for example around 1775 a typhoon hit  and in combination with a subsequent famine reduced the island s population to a low level several generations after the disaster as many as 10 of pingelapese have a  form of  called  this is due to one of the survivors of the depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a mutated gene which the  caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations

effects on natural resources
tropical cyclones reshape the  near the coast by eroding sand from the  as well as offshore rearranging coral and changing dune configuration onshore their rain water gets absorbed into  within caves creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts coastal ridges 
waves and storm surges accompanying tropical cyclones erode undersea sands erode shell deposits break off corals from near shore  in their paths and carry all this detritus landwards in a rolling wave of material that is deposited onshore above highest astronomical  as a ridge of sand shell and coral for example each severe tropical cyclone  i.e category45 on the saffir-simpson scale  crossing northeast  s tropical coastline since the last significant change in sea levels  about 5000years ago  has  emplaced  such ridges within the coastal landscape forming in some places series of ridges and a geomorphological record of highest magnitude cyclones hitting the coast over 3000  5000years eyewitness accounts verify ridges of this kind are formed by severe tropical cyclones and two clear examples cited are the 18 kilometres  11mi  long 35 metres  115ft  wide 3.5 metres  11ft  high coral shingle ridge deposited on funafuti atoll  central south pacific  by  in october 1972 and the large coral shingle ridge deposited on jaluit atoll   by  in january 1958 in tropical northeast australia an intense tropical cyclone hit in march 1918  crossing over the town of   at which time there were eyewitness accounts of a 4.5 metres  15ft  to 5.1 metres  17ft  high ridge of pumice being deposited by that cyclone s surge as it crossed the coast  limestone cave stalagmites 
when tropical cyclones cross land thin layers of  of  light  composition  i.e unusual  ratio of  and   are deposited onto  in  caves up to 300 kilometres  190mi  from the cyclone s path as the cloud tops of tropical cyclones are high and cold and their air is humid  their rainwater is  lighter  in other words the rainfall contains significantly higher quantities of unevaporated oxygen-18 than other tropical rainfall the isotopically lighter rainwater soaks into the ground percolates down into caves and within a couple of weeks oxygen-18 transfers from the water into calcium carbonate before being deposited in thin layers or  rings  within stalagmites a succession of such events created within stalagmites maintain a record of cyclones tracking within a 300 kilometres  190mi  radius of caves going back centuries millennia or even millions of years at actun tunichil muknal cave in central  researchers drilling stalagmites with a computer controlled dental drill accurately identified and verified evidence of isotopically light rainfall for 11 tropical cyclones occurring over a 23-year period  19782001  at the  limestone caves in northeast australia  130 kilometres  81mi  inland from   researchers identified and matched evidence of isotopically light rainfall with 100years of cyclone records and from this have created a record of tropical cyclones from 2004 back to 1200 a.d  an 800-year record  landscapes 
severe tropical cyclones defoliate tropical  trees remove  and  from the trees break tree crown stems and cause tree falls the degree of damage they do along their paths at a landscape level  i.e   10 kilometres  6.2mi  can be catastrophic yet variable and patchy trees break at 42m s regardless of size and type stripping trees and scattering forest debris also provides fuel for  such as a blaze that lasted three months in 1989 and burned 460 square miles  1,200km2  of forest that had been stripped by  
wind velocity gradients or horizontal   size of cyclone the intensity of cyclone proximity to the cyclone and local scale cyclonic convection effects  degree of exposure   exposure  acceleration or local topographic sheltering shading  and
 species composition and forest structure

assessments of cyclone damage done to tropical rainforest landscapes in northeast  have produced the following  for describing and  mapping  the variable impacts they have along their paths as follows 

severe and extensive closest to the centre of cyclone  impact appears to be multidirectional and is evidenced by crowns of most trees having been broken smashed or windthrown
severe and localised closer to the cyclone centre than its edge  direction of the destructive winds is clearly identifiable and severe canopy disruption is limited to the windward aspect of these forested areas
moderate canopy disturbance closer to cyclone edge than its centre  most of the tree stems are still standing with only some treefalls and most of the damage is the defoliation of the canopy and branch breakage 
slight canopy disturbance closest to cyclone edge  occasional stem fall or branch breakage with most of the damage consisting of loss of foliage on the forest edges only subsequently followed by leaf damage and heavy leaf litter falls
